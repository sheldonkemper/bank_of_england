Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking \\u2013 are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?Okay.

So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look \\u2013 meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day.
