### 📌 **Bank of England Employer Project: NLP Analysis of G-SIB Announcements**

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Status-In_Progress-orange.svg)

## **📖 Overview**
This project is part of the *University of Cambridge Career Accelerator*, in collaboration with the **Bank of England**. The goal is to analyse **quarterly earnings announcements** from **Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. 

By leveraging NLP methods such as **topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and summarisation**, we aim to provide insights that support financial stability assessments and risk monitoring.

## **🎯 Objectives**
- Extract and process **textual** data from G-SIB earnings calls.
- Identify **key themes** and emerging trends using **BERTopic** and **LDA**.
- Conduct **sentiment analysis** using **FinBERT**.
- Generate **summary insights** with **instruction-tuned models**.
- Provide a structured **dashboard or reporting format** for key stakeholders.

## **🛠 Setup Instructions**
### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheldonkemper/bank_of_england.git
cd bank_of_england
```

### **2️⃣ Install dependencies**
It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebooks**
If working in **Google Colab**, upload the necessary files and execute the provided notebooks.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## **📊 Methodology**
### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
- Extract **earnings call transcripts** from **public investor relations websites** of G-SIBs.
- Convert PDF and HTML data into structured text.

### **2️⃣ Text Preprocessing**
- Tokenisation, stopword removal, and lemmatisation using **spaCy** and **NLTK**.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect key financial entities.

### **3️⃣ NLP Analysis**
#### 📌 **Topic Modelling**
- **BERTopic** for dynamic topic extraction.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for interpretable topic clustering.

#### 📌 **Sentiment Analysis**
- **FinBERT** for financial sentiment classification.
- Aggregation of sentiment trends over time.

#### 📌 **Summarisation**
- **Instruction-tuned models (e.g., Falcon-7B, FLAN-T5)** for text summarisation.
- Comparison of extractive vs. abstractive summarisation methods.
