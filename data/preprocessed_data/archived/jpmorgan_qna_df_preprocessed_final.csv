1,1Q23,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for â€“ whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",['so jamie actually hoping get perspective see recent developments svb impacting regulatory landscape big banks letter spent fair amount time highlighting consequences overly stringent capital requirements risk steering activities less regulated nonbanks changes scenario planning â€“ whether higher capital increase fdic assessment fees along lines thinking buyback given continued strong capital build lot macro uncertainty moment'],Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic â€“ it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment â€“ that'll be what it is.",['well think already kind complete answering question there look were hoping everyone takes deep breath looks happened breadth depth regulations already place obviously something happens like this adjust think it think road may limitations held-to-maturity maybe tlac certain type-size banks scrutiny interest rate exposure stuff like that revamp whole system recalibrating things right way think done knowing want outcome be outcome want strong community regional banks certain actions taken drastic â€“ could actually make weaker so thats is expect higher capital basel iv effectively and obviously theres going fdic assessment â€“ is'],Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
2,1Q23,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.",['hey thanks good morning hey jeremy wondering give us little bit detail lower funding expectation points made terms offer client might allow kind keep beta lower maybe kind wrap overall beta expectations revised update thank you'],Ken Usdin,"Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out â€“ those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",['yeah sure let summarize drivers change outlook primary driver really lower deposit rate paid expectations across consumer wholesale which mentioned driven couple factors so change rate environment cuts coming sooner outlook else equal take pressure reprice said were getting lot positive feedback field product offerings short-term cd particular really getting lot positive feedback folks branches attractive yield-seeking customers thats kind working well asset side seeing little bit higher card revolve helping ill remind conference february suggested already starting feel like uncertainties mentioned giving guidance started moving direction one things contributed upward revision like uncertainty kind went way jamies pointed â€“ uncertainties still there highlight page look forward year next year medium-term remain focused those'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
3,1Q23,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March 
 in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?",['hi thanks jeremy wanted follow drivers nii revision lower rates paid assumption mentioned fed cuts coming sooner positive feedback customer offers march events bank failures happened march view slow reprice intensity folks moving price reasons intensify industry-wide smaller banks reprice keep deposits events influence view reprice'],John McDonald,"Analyst, Autonomous Research","Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook 
 we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell.

So, Erika, as you know, we take 
 not going to go into a lot of detail here 
 but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability -weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted -average expectation. And I think that the weighted -average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",['yeah so erika know take going go lot detail take outlook economists run bunch different scenarios probability -weight those central case outlook research team actually changed felt line jamie said terms little bit tightening result events march made sense add little bit weight relative adverse case that changed weighted -average expectation think weighted -average peak unemployment were using something like 58%'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
5,1Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing â€“ do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?",['hey good morning maybe little bit deposit thought process there seen inflows think lose going forward maybe talk little bit dynamic pricing â€“ feel like given inflows see pricing power larger banks'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it. If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing â€“ and we look at pricing sheets all the time â€“ every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",['yeah couple things there so first all know right deposits came in know were guessing number two deposits came in so definition somewhat flighty deposits came us prudent appropriate us assume particularly stable number three theres natural amount internal migration deposits money funds overlay thats embedded assumptions number four competitive market entirely possible people temporarily come us time decide go elsewhere so reasons were realistic stickiness it add would say categorically theres pricing power bigger banks look pricing â€“ look pricing sheets time â€“ every bank slightly different position every bank competing three-month six-month nine-month savings rates online banks got treasury bills got money market funds theres pricing power bank obviously different franchises were slightly different position'],"Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
6,1Q23,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June â€“ the results â€“ which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",['comments cet1 ratio obviously came strong 138% got gsib buffer obviously going next year stress test coming summer june â€“ results â€“ maybe lead banks including yours higher stress capital buffer think cet1 ratio end year think'],Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",['yeah things there gerard previously said targeting 135% first quarter 2024 function assuming unchanged scb increased gsib step operating 50-basis-point buffer so point jamie made second ago light environment basel iv dry powder know knows well tweak going forward thats still base case assumption specifically stress test contrary ive heard people argue ability predict scb ahead time running process actually quite limited remember last year even though predict increase almost factor two terms big wound being big surprise whole industry so want quite humble ability predict scb said that right assuming unchanged tailwinds oci believe likely offsets harsher credit shocks number planning purposes right were assuming flat scb well know soon enough actual number is'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
7,1Q23,"How much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy?

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers â€“ is generally in favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it.

8,1Q23,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads?

So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",['yeah mike think yeah referring comments made commercial bank fact larger corporate segment within commercial bank would generally access capital markets also access bank lending margin choosing draw revolvers right rather access capital markets particularly meaningful driver increase nii guidance theres lot odds ends there major drivers ones called out honest actually specifically checked whats happening card yields would imagine theyve gone little bit line rates know follow here'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
9,1Q23,I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII...,['want unpack question possibility higher longer rates impacts non-markets nii'],Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call â€“ the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.",['sure so betsy question good would say look evolution outlook last year pretty clear asset-sensitive certainly terms sort one year forward ear type measure also obviously know current ear actually shows slight negative number tiny bit liability sensitive get nuances may may great predictor short-term point level rates course different last year level rates relationship short-term nii evolution curve always going clear given moment quite tricky behave somewhat wonky ways function of again ive alluded couple times call â€“ competitive environment deposits not fact sort mathematically predictable thing function rate curve so thats were emphasizing different drivers uncertainty nii outlook yeah'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

11,1Q23,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances.

So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. It's normalization. Yeah.

13,2Q23,"Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss â€“ I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond?

Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen.

14,2Q23,"So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",['guess want ask broader question really here maybe jamie id like get thoughts earned 23% rotce 138% cet1 hear loud clear normalized nii generation $87 billion said fully taking account potential haircut basel iii endgame possible natural rotce maybe 17% through-the-cycle rate rates zero first introduced rotce target different world rate scenario everybodys talking even fed cuts natural sort bottom fed funds going zero input would great'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",['yeah thanks erika mean good question theres lot there obviously guess would start saying talked 17% through-the-cycle rotce even though may introduced moment lower zero bound always premised sort normalized rate environment level remains true today furthermore ask explicitly context proposed basel iii endgame one relevant question might lot capital denominator happens target think said prepared remarks feel confident companys ability produce excellent returns cycle theres lot moving parts right that; could good could bad narrowly capital one one thing point straight-up math simply diluting rotce expanding denominator misses possibility repricing products services course goes back point capital increases impacts real economy were suggesting price way it obviously need get right returns products services pricing power adjust higher capital lot moving parts there think important point range scenarios feel good ability deliver good results well see mix various factors plays especially see basel iii proposal go comment period'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barrâ€™s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business.

Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",['sure good question ken think terms investment banking markets yeah slightly better expected last month would talk green shoots especially capital markets generally still definitely headwinds m&a lower announced activity regulatory headwinds there well see think little early call trend based recent results well see terms broader economy loan growth expectations generally still expect reasonably robust card loan growth away variety different reasons different products whether mortgage c&i revolver normalization especially see little bit cooling economy would expect loan demand relatively modest there were really expecting meaningful growth away card course were right deals right products right terms lend cycle see demand-driven narrative function economy rather tightening side'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",['yeah gerard would say honestly much changed actually pretty consistently concerned risk higher rates course always try position things produce reasonable outcomes across broad range scenarios margin weve biased towards higher rates may little less true levels before although lot consequence deposit convexity playing modeling case else equal think going continue focus making sure were fine higher rate scenario staying balanced across range scenarios really lot change positioning thats obviously including fact took first republic which even net liabilities long structural interest rate position actually want get longer part deal result took actions ensure net-net still last quarter'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know.

And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech.

Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, weâ€™ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build â€“ I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion â€“ or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve.

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space.

LLC","Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.

We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle.

41,4Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?",['hey good morning maybe follow different way nii question deposits you jeremy discuss assumptions reprice migration thoughts then layering get six cuts start change dynamic around growth deposits thinking that'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",['yeah good questions lets reprice first so think else equal dovish fed environment six cuts effect taking little bit pressure reprice especially product-level reprice time continue expect internal migration particularly checking savings cds wholesale little bit ongoing migration non-interest-bearing interest-bearing trajectory would expect continue even lower rate environment so result look weighted average rate paid example consumer deposit franchise would actually expect number little bit higher even world six cuts thats actually intuitive think it people continue migrating cds maybe little non-intuitive kind trying beta type math like change rates change rate paid gets little bit non-intuitive then terms balances yeah note said outlook balances modestly down consider qt despite various speculations slow later year continues loan growth system whole expected quite muted pretty modest decline outlook consistent lower rates so kind agree environment margin little bit supportive system-wide deposit balances then obviously continue optimistic ability take share deposits based customer value proposition across different businesses'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
42,4Q23,"Do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?",['believe outlook soft landing increased market pricing correctly look customer base still worried lagged effects rate hikes'],Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling â€“ obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios â€“ is a very strong labor market.

But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.

Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah â€“ and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology â€“ which I think is interesting â€“ that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.",['yeah mike thanks question yeah â€“ course will noted hearing us investor day investor day take little bit extra time answer question right important give transparency im going follow structure used page go line business so starting ccb biggest dollar driver overall 8% increase year-on-year last year one key driver branch strategy associated staff that 2023 built 166 new branches were planning similar number year marketing also driver were seeing great opportunities great demand engagement card products so shows marketing well know wealth strategy ccb remains big focus priority think worth noting here right weve talked know mike investments designed produce short-term payoffs much longer-term table stakes actually see quite bit evidence current payoffs current results ccb investment so example 2023 2 million net new checking accounts 8% growth active card accounts last three years weve increased deposit market share 180 basis points so weve often said company whole were happy producing good current returns growth investing future awm continued client advisor hiring key driver well making sure advisors new clients support need little bit prior question awm also little bit volume revenue-related driver tied improved revenue outlook commercial bank interesting story sense half exit rate impact ads middle year based market disruption kind new clients new loans saw need support across entire ecosystem well fact created opportunity middle year accelerate longstanding preexisting innovation economy strategy so took opportunities onboard key teams different parts franchise then look 2024 really pretty consistent themes ones before including hiring bankers domestically internationally cib story little bit different percentage growth lower recognizes think very strong share positions starting point also fact weve investing quite aggressively time payments business produced meaningful payoffs already terms significant share gains so result biggest driver cib really generic inflation including labor well as prior question volume revenue-related increases tied improved nir outlook want say avoidance doubt despite this core strategy looking granularly areas strength weakness making sure were upgrading appropriate absolutely best talent cib remains fully effect finally note actually talked technology businesses thats actually even though businesses various ways investing technology spending money it drivers actually consistent across entire firm even though bottoms-up driven drivers consistent theyve been new products features customer platforms well modernization so thats happening throughout company app level otherwise say actually closing talking technology â€“ think interesting â€“ point driver growth writ large one things see higher volume-related technology expense throughout company so thanks question mike good opportunity give guys bit color here'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed.

We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.

But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or 
 I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor?

Peabody,"Analyst, Portales Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics.

And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much. Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend â€“ steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there are also â€“ it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the â€“ on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.",['yeah so betsy answer question want say something behalf us jpmorgan and personally thrilled call know betsy terrible medical episode reminder us lucky here but betsy particular amount respect have work character last 20 plus years exceptional so behalf us want welcome back thrilled here so asking pertinent question so were earning lot money capital cup runneth over thats weve increased dividend asking wed like pay something like third third normalized earnings course hard calculate always normalized earnings are mind little bit ahead sometimes little bit behind sometimes could give people kind consistent dividend guidance et cetera think far important question 15% so look 15% im going oversimplify it basically prepare us total basel endgame today roughly specifics matter much remember lot things change short-run long-run looks like basel iii endgame may worst case itll something less that so obviously happens would free lot capital im going say order $20 billion something like that and yes weve always capital hierarchy way were going use capital build business first mean pay dividend â€“ steady dividend build business think appropriate buy back stock were continuing buy back stock $2 billion quarter (sic) personally want buy back lot current prices think heard talk world things like that so waiting preparation basel hopefully well know something later much specific all meantime also â€“ important put mind short-term uses capital good shareholders could reduce cet1 too so may see us things short-run increase earnings increase capital using capital jeremy mentioned â€“ one things know balance sheet use balance sheet credit trading could things now so great position in were going very patient urge analysts keep mind excess capital wasted capital earnings store deploy good way shareholders due course'],Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?",['hey good morning jeremy speak trends seeing respect deposit migration quarter theres change seen migration start slow not'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where â€“ even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",['yeah good question jim think simplest best answer is: really so weve saying while migration checking savings cds sort dominant trend driving increase weighted average rate paid consumer deposit franchise continues continue capture money-in-motion high rate were happy means consumer franchise level engagement were seeing im aware theres little bit narrative seeing end people sometimes refer cash sorting weve looked data see evidence maybe slowing little bit were quite cautious that really sort think makes sense assume world checking savings paying effectively zero policy rate 5% going see ongoing migration frankly expect see even world â€“ even current yield curve environment change meaningful cuts get reintroduced would actually start see those would still expect see ongoing migration yield-seeking behavior so quite conceivable actually yield curve fourth quarter six cuts it still nonetheless expecting increase weighted average rate paid migration continues so would say meaningful change trends expectation ongoing migration much still there'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out â€“ not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're â€“ if they â€“ you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen.

54,1Q24,"Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on 
without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that

So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over -earning, right? So, 
obviously, one major area is that we're over -earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting 
sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's 
probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. 

You also have heard Jamie say that we're over -earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge -offs have been particularly low, but we have 
builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge -offs are now 
close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge -offs being very low by historical standards, although that was 
coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But 
broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over -earning narrative. 

Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the 
what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so 
on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential 
updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see 
through the Basel III Endgame. 

At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say 
except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in 
relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the 
rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away.

I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, thatâ€™s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.

Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world.

So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A.

So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like â€“ into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So â€“ that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",['yeah sure so let break question couple different parts so think jamie sort suggesting that think concept kind like strategic capital versus tactical capital lack better term hes kind saying that moment carrying lot excess capital sort strategic reasons ability least theory deploy portions kind like â€“ relatively short-duration assets strategies client opportunities whatever moment whatever reason might thought tactical sense so hes pointing thats option have extent quarters increase markets rwa reflection that maybe little bit probably not agree hard given quarter specifically link change capital rwa change revenue versus many moving parts there sure one thing thats true higher run rate markets businesses whole talked second ago linked also higher deployment balance sheet businesses so well know pride extremely analytical extremely disciplined analyze capital liquidity balance sheet deployment gsib capacity utilization et cetera markets business chase revenue; go returns fully measured thats part dna continue will â€“ still operating multiple binding constraints obviously environment complex ability sort throw ton capital opportunities quite simple always big picture clearly very strong capital position is small part anticipation uncertainty also mean opportunities arise basel iii endgame final well positioned take advantage opportunities'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
59,1Q24,"Can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter?

And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?",['share us color whats going corporate lending market terms spreads seem getting tighter reflecting think real fear global geopolitical world color guys seeing leveraged loan market well'],Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case.

60,1Q24,"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks?

I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.",['right okay charlie theres lot there honest love idea spending lot time call speculating bank failures obviously particular view next wave landscape im going bother debating you guess let try say couple things best answer question talked earlier lot capital jamie says capital earnings store right see lot really compelling opportunities deploy capital opportunities arise despite uncertainty basel iii endgame well positioned deploy it think embedded also sort question fdic fdics attitude towards different types bidders obviously theres lot thinking analysis happening entire process recent forums speeches bank resolution forth think probably agree better else equal system much capital available many different types capital available ensure things stabilized anything ever goes wrong mechanics talking banks trivial underestimated guess thats probably much that'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
61,2Q24,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?",['so wanted start question capital given indications fed considering favorable revisions basel iii endgame gsib surcharge calculations know pushing time evaluate different capital scenarios revisions material enough could support higher normalized rotce firm versus 17% target so might impact inform appetite buybacks going forward'],Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",['right okay thanks steve actually answering question want remind everyone jamie able join travel conflict overseas going today okay good question capital rotce so let start rotce point first short answer question would no hard imagine scenario coming whole potential range outcomes capital involves upward revision rotce think way weve talking this weve said basel iii endgame proposal 17% cycle target imagine range different outcomes vast majority involve expansions denominator ideas changing perimeter repricing still sort effect would thought mitigants rather things would actually like increase rotce really think answer particularly changed so now thats would say good pivot next point is yeah weve reading press coverage reading fun interesting speculate potential outcomes here reality know anything know know reliable press coverage is so sense feel like overall capital return buyback trajectory much actually changed relative laid investor day comments made then comments jamie made then well comments jamie made subsequent week industry conference so maybe ill briefly summarize everyones benefit think is is one recognize current practice capital return buybacks lead ever-expanding cet1 ratio obviously were going run company cycle time reasonable cet1 ratio reasonable buffers relative requirement so uncertainty sorted out question deployment capital one way another matter when if capital hierarchy also worth noting thats another thing remains unchanged ill review quickly growing business organically inorganically sustainable dividend context worth noting boards announced intention increase $125 19% increase prior last year so thats testament performance return capital then finally buybacks hierarchy commit us return 100% capital generation given quarter so sit today look relationship opportunity cost deploying capital opportunities deploy capital outside firm kind hard imagine environment relationship argues strongly patience so given that putting together sorry long answer remain comfortable current amount excess capital jamie said really continue think earnings store much anything else'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like?

So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed â€“ not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro formaâ€™d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank.

Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out.",['yeah thanks ken progress right mean were happy see progress people talking depressed banking fee wallet time nice see year-on-year pop low base also nice sequential improvement so thats first thing say terms dialog engagement definitely elevated so dialog ecm elevated dialog m&a quite robust well so good things encourage us make us hopeful could seeing sort better trend space important caveats so dcm side yeah made pull-forward comments first quarter still feel second quarter still reflects bunch pull-forward therefore were reasonably cautious second half year importantly lot activity refinancing activity opposed to example acquisition finance so fact m&a remains still relatively muted terms actual deals knock-on effects dcm well higher percentage wallet refied pull-forward risk becomes little bit higher ecm look kind remove might ask question given performance overall indices would think would really booming environment ipos example improving quite good would otherwise expect thats driven variety factors including fact that widely discussed extent performance large indices driven by like stocks sort mid-cap tech growth space spaces would typically driving ipos much muted performance also lot private capital raised couple years ago raised pretty high valuations so cases people looking ipos could looking down-rounds thats issue secondary market performance ipos improved meaningfully cases people still concerns that so little bit overhang space think hope time fades away trend gets bit robust and yeah advisory side regulatory overhang there remains there so well see plays out'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was.

65,2Q24,"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?",['good morning wondering elaborate essentially math behind rotce high 20% normalized 17% obviously pointed overearning nii guess question is go 20% 17% so consumer deposit costs components could help frame us'],Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's â€“ we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about â€“ Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and thatâ€™s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and itâ€™s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that, what youâ€™re left with is my answer to Steveâ€™s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when weâ€™re generating these types of earnings and thereâ€™s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we donâ€™t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. Theyâ€™re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. Itâ€™s just that we donâ€™t feel that now is the right time.",['yeah thats good fair question betsy so let try unpack best ability so particular order one thing weve really tried emphasize number different settings including recent 10-qs actually want get business guiding buybacks so were going buy back whatever think makes sense current moment sort reserve right sort change time so recognize everyone loves that kind philosophical belief so might well say explicitly pretty clear q also im going say again so thats point one said that let nonetheless try address point framework governors so generally speaking think make sense sort exit market entirely unless conditions much unusual right now lets say obviously whatever reason ever need build capital hurry weve done were always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely think modest amount buybacks reasonable thing generating kind capital so talking $2 billion pace were kind trying move away notion pace thats idea comes from lets put way talked $49 billion recognize may seem like little bit random number actually comes statement weve made significant item gains visa think means means have post acceptance exchange offer meaningful long position liquid large cap financial stock ie visa realistically highly correlated stock so sense carry instead buying back jpmorgan stock so talked â€“ jamie talked about liquidate visa deploying proceeds jpm thatâ€™s quarter so $49 billion little higher itâ€™s consistent comments investor day around slightly increased amount buybacks beyond that youâ€™re left answer steveâ€™s question that point buying back earnings whatever weâ€™re generating types earnings thereâ€™s much organic capital generated absence opportunities deploy organically inorganically continuing maintain healthy sustainable dividend donâ€™t return capital going keep growing cet1 ratio levels which think long strategic outlook company reasonable theyâ€™re artificially high unnecessary so one way other need addressed point itâ€™s donâ€™t feel right time'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn't focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.

69,2Q24,The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?,['consensus provision 2024 $107 billion could maybe clarify sort jamies comments industry conference earlier try sort triangulate $107 billion provision appropriate growth level planning card'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance â€“ the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",['yeah happy clarify that so jamies comments allowance â€“ build card allowance were talking card specifically expected something like $2 billion full year sit today expectation number actually slightly higher ballpark think terms means consensus overall allowance change year last time checked still looked little low front so knows itll actually wind being remains view one question weve gotten reconcile build 12% growth os weve talked seems like little bit high relative would otherwise assumed apply sort standard coverage ratio growth reason thats case essentially combination higher revolving mix continue see normalization revolve 12% well seasoning earlier vintages comes slightly higher allowance per unit os growth'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
70,2Q24,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.",['oh hey good morning maybe one last question sort deploying excess capital seems like two primary ways organically would trading book loan book so maybe two questions there one trading assets 20% year-over-year leaning function demand opportunities grow that then secondly outside card loan demand quite weak thoughts seeing change demand thinking loan demand going forward thanks'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are â€“ gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.",['thanks jim good questions so yeah trading assets up basically client activity primarily secured financing-related sort matchbook repo-type stuff similar things â€“ gross balance sheet quite bit quite low risk therefore quite low rwa intensity so ability supply financing clients something were happy much represents us leaning franchise serve clients really particularly rwa therefore capital intensive therefore really reflect aggressive choice part deploy capital speak loan demand front yeah mean unfortunately much new say loan demand meaning point loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except card card business is course way capital constrained so whatever growth makes sense terms customer franchise ability acquire accounts retain accounts fits inside credit risk appetite growth thats going make sense so were happy deploy capital that constrained willingness ability deploy capital that and course rest loan space last thing were going excess capital meaning lean lending inside risk appetite inside credit box especially world spreads quite compressed terms pressure so theres always balance capital deployment assessing economic risk rationally frankly is sense microcosm larger challenge right now talked ever moment opportunity cost deploying capital relative attractive opportunities outside walls company are would terms patient thats little bit one example referring to'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

72,3Q24,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025?",['hey good morning so jeremy highlighted full year nii guidance implies sizable drop q4 nii ex markets 6% so maybe discuss largest drivers sequential decline including initial thoughts deposit behavior pricing since 50 basis point cut since related ill throw follow-up question realize forward curve moving around lot since dan brought month ago frame thinking nii trajectory 2025'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact â€“ that we're expecting â€“ is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll â€“ well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",['yeah sure jim ill try answer questions together best ability so sit today biggest single driver sequential decline is fact â€“ were expecting â€“ is fact yield curve so yield curve changed little bit since daniel made comments conference earlier quarter significantly terms deposit balances obviously another important factor light fed starting cutting cycle feels us like right now mentioned prepared remarks consumer were pretty much trough right speak look yield-seeking behavior come quite bit thats longer much headwind else equal look checking account balances pretty stable time see indication consumers kind done spending cash buffers thats kind supportive consumer deposit balances context relevant point cd mix where rate cuts coming expect cd balances price pretty high betas probably cd mix actually peaking around now move wholesale weve actually already seeing little bit growth there combine sort increasing view many people market likely end qt announced sometime soon thats also little bit supportive deposit balances so maybe ill â€“ well guess also asked little bit next year so guess one thing say right sequential increase nii quarter and may recall investor day said chance would see sequential increases followed sequential declines people avoid kind drawing conclusion wed hit trough happens thats essentially exactly were seeing now sit now given yield curve assuming yield curve materializes obviously see pretty clear picture sequential declines nii ex markets trough may happening sometime middle next year point combination balances card revolve growth factors return us sequential growth obviously were guessing pretty far future well give formal guidance stuff next quarter think gives better framework work with'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
73,3Q24,"So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.",['jeremy you want ask expenses light comments daniel made recently noting consensus expense forecast next year looked little bit light believe time $94 billion adjust one-timers year would suggest core expense base thats $90 billion pretty healthy step-up expenses know always strong commitment discipline around investment want better understand incremental dollars deployed investments prioritized particular looking next year'],Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII.",['sure good question agree numbers agree way normalized year one-time type significant items also consensus daniel made comments were it would also remind nii comments time consensus year $915 billion next year $90 billion implying time sequential decline $15 billion felt decline big enough made comments made happy expand that anyway expenses yeah start sake argument base $90 billion obviously inflation normalizing obviously were always trying generate efficiencies offset inflation but said assume 3% sake argument base thats billion dollars right gates were working against thats one thing thing continued execute growth strategies year theres insignificant amount annualization cant quite see fourth quarter numbers seasonality incentive comp strip out would see probably sequential increases annualization additional headwind thing thats worth noting expect fees volume-related businesses grow next year else equal would come higher expense loading assemble those goes long way explain sort consensus number slightly $94 billion seemed light terms priorities investments really nothing changed like strategy changed strategy changed plans changed were kind executing long-term perspective weve always had would note relative nii obviously were third quarter now fourth quarter old days used give guidance investor day late february give formal expense guidance next quarter both well expenses nii next quarter especially expenses middle budget cycle right probably little less visibility margin nii'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
74,3Q24,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",['first question thank much answering nii questions far jeremy guess another follow-up imagine daniel said said stage september everyone trying figure over/under net interest income next year maybe two-part first question second inspired jamie said number one nii expected 6% sequentially fourth quarter think year-over-year 2025 consensus 4% new level sounds like consensus still room come down based forward curve jeremy could little bit worse year-over-year fourth quarter sequential rate said jamie noted idea curve going look like right gyrated much think curve better jpmorgan cuts short end steepness less cuts little bit flatter curve'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.",['right okay threw curve ball end there erika expecting end question let answer beginning question ill also answer end question see current 2025 consensus nii ex markets currently $87 billion obviously lower conference earlier quarter were happy see move little bit line us still looks little toppy definitely ballpark consists of already mentioned previously sort expect nii trough sometime middle year kind assemble parts got fourth quarter run rate got sequential declines got trough middle year got rough ballpark full year imagine trough probably little lower numbers extent growth revolves resumes back half year deposit balances ongoing tailwind card revolve although tailwind little bit less might otherwise thought mean sorry little bit less year still tailwind obviously mix things play different ways point out knows yield curve wind doing current assumptions current yield curve remembering were third quarter now were kind early thats think'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost â€“ Iâ€™m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of itâ€™s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to â€“ $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have â€“ I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",['yeah let take time cover one obviously become important people talking theyre growing partnering things like that first foremost â€“ iâ€™m going talk strategic tactical think theyre important first foremost give clients agnostic view world best product services them therefore client comes in offer direct lending ourselves syndicated lending specialized kind lending pluses minuses direct lending could done faster maybe simpler covenants unitranche expensive seeing little things go back forth syndicated lending direct lending were going offer clients basically whats best interest tell products across venue mentioned past allocated $10 billion capital make direct loans weve actually deployed lot capital already paid off itâ€™s done going directly going â€“ $10 billion could $20 billion $30 billion limiting today say today were extending $500 million $1 billion $1 billion well sole-handed well partners importantly going allocate one partner â€“ think weve announced bunch co-lenders creates flexibility size were going use flexibility slow get permission everybody like said jpmorgan could underwrite like bridge loan syndicate fact were going use risk measures stuff like that again service client making sure were offering best thing were going different strategies were going tie exclusively one capital provider think would limit could offer clients probably would price competitive could specific thing solution third-party capital provider thats strategy were going there were going it were going spite fact theres capital arbitrage taking place look arbitrage today bank hold things insurance could dramatically different thats disadvantage weve disadvantages businesses long time going whats right client remember business client also get revenues them loan; look whole relationship were quite comfortable compete announced much bigger lending platforms sizes stuff like that hope press heard too'],Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable.

And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time.

It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.

And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.

81,3Q24,"I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",['im going ask specific nii 2025 want delve think deposit margin volume dynamics ccb next years seen decent amount pressure deposit margin 26% 30 basis points deposit balances come down put pressure deposit nii deposit margins still well rates levels consistent forward curve going guess think volumes margin dynamics rates come down say level consistent forward curve conversely volume offset mentioned jeremy retail deposits becoming tailwind but guess much tailwind could be especially expecting gain quite bit market share retail deposits give us sense sort push pull dynamics really help drive deposit value deposit franchise'],Saul Martinez,"Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer.",['sure yeah thanks question saul think laid building blocks already simplicity im going try answer question without referring disclosed ccb deposit margin number number obviously combination rate paid ccb deposits internal ftp that complicated thing evolves function modeling betas things think actually helpful look simply firmwide perspective look evolution rate paid context policy rates roughly set aside duration management sort factors think that see weve saying deposit margin defined purposes simply difference policy rate weighted-average rate paid consumer deposits unsustainably high going correct one way other either deposits going reprice product level checking savings and/or going see ton internal migration ie growth cd mix and/or would see lower policy rate sit right now course make pricing decisions context market competition given moment looking environment deposits needed reprice order retain primary bank relationships also core strategy never going chase sort hot money margin weve leaned heavily cds gotten current level cd mix thats good strategy sit now margin coming result policy rate coming down seems that puts us pretty comfortable position pricing perspective think cd mix probably peaked now way down going go back zero beginning cycle thats important thing realize else equal creates little bit margin compression that obviously lower yield environment mean theres little bit less outflow consumer deposits mentioned were seeing lot less yield-seeking behavior overlay onto mentioned long-term share growth ccb deposits small part function brand strategy buildout fact quarter top 125 markets ccb 15% share number believe theres big opportunity grow rest track type average annual share growth order 30 basis points 40 basis points weve seen historically thats kind assemble tailwind normalized deposit margin balance growth consumer'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."

And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",['so yeah noted points always make repeat them think way were thinking right feel comfortable notion makes sense us nice store extra capital light current environment believe theres good chance moment get deploy better levels essentially whatever way current opportunities would suggest feels like correct kind strategic financial decision us said that studied quite extensively last six months debates would expect weve concluded enough enough excess given that would like excess grow here so think implications that given amount organic capital generation were producing means unless find near term opportunities organic deployment otherwise means capital return buybacks else equal order arrest growth excess current plan although ill give caveat that know disclosure want get business guiding buybacks reserve right change trajectory time reason current thinking'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"

I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors.

85,4Q24,"Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that 
 somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by 
 to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",['wanted follow questions capital maybe ask of jeremy crosscurrents terms denominator so look third quarter regulatory data g-sib surcharge score would imply score would put range 5% g-sib so obviously understand print somewhere near score end year g-sib surcharge goes 5% 50 basis points two years one day now time around holidays get press release federal reserve lawsuit banks terms transparency looks like transparency going focused perhaps improved soon years stress test so think definition excess right part like 157% clearly huge number so think returns going forward definition excess also continues shift so think crosscurrents terms two big components clearly one g-sib surcharge stress capital buffer'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",['right erika okay tempting many rabbit holes deep lets try address much great length first all g-sib so yes high print third quarter normal seasonality third quarter fourth quarter so current view g-sib number estimate were quite confident wound comfortably 5% bucket result normal seasonality actually relatively quiet december terms types year-end things sometimes create pressures various types less might otherwise expected terms typical seasonal patterns so much see there obvious point also even existing proposed g-sib rule obviously little bit hung up smaller buckets recalibration on even sort obvious would mattered one way other but anyway now were managing current rules normal seasonality took us back 5% okay mentioned lawsuit think thing say happy see clear recognition part fed many things weve talking long time terms transparency volatility non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated ccar process needs improvement so thats great think speak industry bodies actual litigants seems me read said publicly press releases much anything preserving rights light statute limitations deadlines coming up so lets hope see significant progress front then taking step back high level really asking is core view about think probably best way think lens numerator actually core view just sake argument assume modest growth normalized amount economic denominator like actual need capital organically likely additional numerator needed function environment way were increasingly thinking different scenario analysis like flat numerator 5% numerator 10% numerator 20% numerator guess could versions world numerators little less guessing central case comparing projected capital amount number determine excess point out 157% think actual quantum numerator something like $275 billion pretty much reasonable lens ton excess weve concluded need grow anymore'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"

But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, 
 frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance 
 because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't 
 loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But  
 as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a  
 significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be 
 decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. 
 
 Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're 
 getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. 
 Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth 
 environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at 
 the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll 
 see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our 
 big long-standing investment strategies. 
 
 The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly 
 underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we 
 bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the 
 franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside 
 Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any

Poonawala,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.","Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio â€“ of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add? I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation.

Iâ€™ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",['thats fascinating gerard iâ€™ll take look data actually recognize numbers speak ourselves look encouraging growth see checking franchise couple things so course excess yield-seeking behavior see people moving money checking higher-yielding alternatives course last couple years rate cycle feels us were final innings that were seeing nearly much yield-seeking pressure seen meantime well know aggressively engaging clients acquiring new clients deepening lot different markets part branch expansion strategy deepening markets combination tail-end yield-seeking flows excellent client engagement success sort organic build franchise starting show checking account growth see healthy indicator franchise'],Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
