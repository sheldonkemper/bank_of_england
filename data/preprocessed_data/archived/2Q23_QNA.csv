"Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?",Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.",John McDonald,"Analyst, Autonomous Research","Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side.,Ken Usdin,"Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?",Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Steve, you there?",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.",,,
"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about 
Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago 
how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?",Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?",Mike Mayo,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.",Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes?",Glenn Schorr,"Analyst, Evercore ISI","Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.",Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead. I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts.","Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event 
 to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",Charles W. Peabody,"Analyst, Portales Partners LLC","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. And I would just add to that 
 just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.","Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
And we have no further questions at this time.,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you, guys.",Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
