Chis Hallam,Goldman,"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Goldman,"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody.

Kian Abouhossein,JPMorgan,"Yeah. Thanks. Just two questions. The first one is related to the book value per share guidance that you gave of the 74% increase on day one. Just wondering if that still holds, first of all, at this point, or has that changed post your further analysis. And in that context, should we assume that the purchase accounting, restructuring, asset marks, etcetera, should be captured by the reserves that is being built off what we estimate 21 billion. The second question is in relation to more top down. How we should think about the impact on clients at this point and also retention of clients, especially in wealth management at this point already. And how we should think about retention of clients post the event, the clients that have left. How should we think about your position after that?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,JPMorgan,"Yeah. Thanks. Just two questions.

Of course, we are continuing to do the work on the PPA and we're going to continue to do so. And the PPA was, of course, included in the estimates that we had given you."

Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential to your plans because you’ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future.

Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,"Yes. Good morning. The first question I wanted to ask you is regarding the net new money, so the net new FGA. You gave us some details you know including post the 10 business days that followed the announcement of the deal and thank you for that. I don't think I've seen any comment around the trend in April. So, just wanted to ask you know, what trend you've seen in terms of the customer behavior and especially regarding the NNFGA as well as customer deposits since the quarter ended about three weeks ago. And then I just wanted to come back to the risk around – the you know concentration risk around clients and the overlap on the client base. You made interesting comments regarding the fact that you are underweight certain client segment versus CS, and where you can gain from that transaction. There is another client segment which could lose. Can you maybe provide us more details? Do you mean in wealth management specifically, also in P&C? Can you maybe comment on those client segments?

Thank you.","Yeah. On the client side. I mean, if you look at, for example, in Asia, I think it’s clear that UBS has that perhaps a stronger franchise in North Asia and Credit Suisse has a stronger franchise, relatively speaking, in Southeast Asia. So, I think that the combination of the two is very complementary. Latin America, I mean, in Latin America, we definitely have a situation in which Credit Suisse brings a significant value to our platform. And there, that will make us, if not the leader of non-Latin American players, very close to that. So, a significant step forward. In respect of Switzerland, I would say that usually, SMEs have a relationship with maybe one of the large banks and with a cantonal bank or a regional bank. So, it’s – there is a high likelihood that the same SMEs don’t really have equal a relationship with the two large banks. For that reason, we believe that many of them can be captured. Same issue for retail and personal clients banking. If people have two relationships, usually they have it with a local bank and with a large bank. So, also there. And last but not least, I would say, that it’s fair to say that Credit Suisse has a strong franchise in large corporates in Switzerland, which is also complementary to our own. So, after all, as I say, both in terms of current business mix, but also going back to my remarks. In Switzerland, there are 250 banks. It’s plenty of competition, plenty of cantonal banks, plenty of Raiffeisen Banks. And, therefore, we believe that we will be able to manage this competitive landscape, which is not easy for us through service quality and what we can do differently than others rather than just purely size."

Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Good morning. Two questions. Firstly, just on slide 10 in your revised net interest income outlook, Q1, you’ve seen a slight increase in NII. So then you are guiding to a mid-single digit decrease for Q2. So that implies Q2 will be slightly below the Q4 run rate. Implicitly, this seems to suggest that Q3, Q4 is roughly then going to be stable based on your full year guidance. So, I’m interested in your thoughts on the offset between rate hikes and then most important of all, deposit migration to money market funds in future quarters. Given that we’re closing in on peak rates, it seems to imply you’re achieving, the deposit migration also slows, but would welcome any commentary on that. And then my second question is actually on the liquidity coverage ratio. I think there’s an active debate as to whether it’s calibrated correctly in light of recent events, particularly the 10% weighting that’s applied to less stable retail deposits. So, interested in any conversations you’ve had on that either with FINMA or the Basel Committee. And likewise, does that mean you’re going to continue to run with an LCR of, you know, north of 160%, given the potential that that ratio might be recalibrated?

Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Morning. I've got two. One is a bit of a follow up on LCR and on your long-term funding strategy. Clearly, LCR standalone is pretty strong. If you look at the business you're acquiring, then it's really propped up by a big SNB liquidity line and that deposits are very, very low. Loans to deposit is 157%. So, I was just wondering how you're thinking about your long-term funding strategy through the acquisition and how you might deal with kind of the flight of deposits that they have seen and how you can integrate that into your liquidity model going forward. And then second on a slightly different topic. In GWM, you've got flat costs on lower revenues, and a favorable revenue mix with NII up and fees down. Normally, that is a good mix for your cost base. Could you just discuss a little bit more what's going on in there, what sort of inflation you're seeing, whether there is an increased competition for relationship managers, and whether that's changing given the new environment?

You know I guess where I'm coming from is based on the current revenue trajectory, the 8 billion of cost reductions might not actually be enough. So, could we be in a situation where a deeper restructuring is required. And then maybe secondly, around buybacks.

Andrew Lim,Société Générale,"Hi. Good morning. And welcome back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the more integrated disclosure on the beta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly from the U.S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some color on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024. And then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the perimeter of what mean – of what goes into non-core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few years now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS lumps with IBD. I guess the question is how do you see that business within your IB structure?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Société Générale,,"In terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, first of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or below the modelled beta. But then what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which are yielding those higher overall, on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we are in the cycle. So in the U.S. where those very high rates where we are at very high incremental betas. And that's continuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in Europe, we went from being really at fairly low levels to – now moving into a place where there is price sensitivity, especially for GWM clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit of mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix shift there. And then on – in Switzerland, you've got a mix where you've got the P&C, especially in Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of Switzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have – or are still in that place in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shift or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, going into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024, really, it will depend on the rate path."
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. A billion dollar beat in the quarter. I never did quite get the hang of forecasting lark. Just on that then -- so non-core, very strong performance and appreciate the updated runoff profile you give us on slide 6. Is there any reason that you're just reverting to natural runoff or can we expect continued sales if markets stay favorable because clearly there's quite a meaningful driver of the very favorable capital ratio and the interactions of all of those. And then secondly, the project to improve the revenue to risk-weighted assets in wealth management, are presumably, you wouldn't represent the Q1 performances kind of the payoff of that project is? It's too early but just what's the profile of that project? How long is that repricing sitting on the net new asset generation and has it started?

Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yes, yes. Thank you, Sergio.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Bank of America,"Yes, yes. Thank you, Sergio.","Hey, Alastair. Thanks for the questions. So on NCL, I mean first reverting to natural runoff. I mean, we've been consistent in just reflecting the natural runoff profile. What I think the slide 6 really does indicate is, it really narrows that, that delta between where we started, you know, as you can see where we set our ambition is to reduce to 5% and, you know, that the natural runoff profile has really come in. You see that the delta between the natural runoff profile and where we, our ambition is narrowed. So that should, eliminate whatever uncertainty was considered, but I do think that it's appropriate still to reflect it that way in terms of, you know, whether we can do more of course we're going to continue to do what we can. We'll try to position -- we'll try to exit positions, at or above their, their book values wherever possible. But, you know, it's appropriate to continue to stick with our guidance on NCL, in terms of, you know, our approach, and in terms of our expectations around revenues. On GWM in terms of revenue over the RWA, I mentioned that we're starting to see progress, which of course does suggest you asked, has it started and it has. In fact, it started at the end of last year and the business is quite active in it. And, and so, we would expect that we're going to continue to make progress on driving up RWA efficiency with respect to revenues in that respect over the course of the next couple of years. You asked how long that will impact. How long will it go? How long will it impact net new assets? We said, it's going to take the better part of two years which is why we guided net new assets of around 200 billion over that two-year timeframe. And we think that's the appropriate guidance still."

Yeah. Hey Chris,"I’ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better","view on the net that we’ll get to. Look, you know I think we're quite pleased with that 1Q operating expense performance. We did highlight that we expect gross saves to be halfway to our 13 billion ambitions at the end of the year which is a bit better than we highlighted in February in large part because of the 1Q performance that we saw. But look, we still -- our ambition is a cost-to-income ratio of less than 70% at the end of 2026. That's what we're really focused on to manage to and so how we pace any investments, which we'll continue to make in, for example, the resilience of our infrastructure, the organic growth in our core businesses, how we pace that will be a function of the revenue environment. So it is still -- it is still way too early to change that perspective. But of course, we are pleased with the opex performance we saw in 1Q. As to how that impacts on the return on CET1 path that you mentioned, I would say that coupled with the updated NCL full-year PBT guidance I gave, would have roughly 100 to - slightly above basis point impact on the return on CET1, but I would still say mid single-digits is the right way to think about the full year ROCET1, even with the 1Q performance that we produced.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,"I’ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better",,

Kian Abouhossein,JP,"Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- how one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the environment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows – and 1Q was, but I would really highlight that it wasn’t so much just beta. But actually, it’s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it’s an environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in more complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and then also, I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say it gives us confidence as we look out forward. One is that the align product shelf, so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've approached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the playbook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also paying off. So we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to be conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned and really allows us to drive transactional flows higher."

I would just reiterate that the trajectory that we highlighted over the next two years is, among other things, a function of the financial resource optimization and balance sheet initiatives that the team is hard at work in undertaking. So 27 billion in the quarter is a strong result, we're on track to deliver on our ambitions, which we said was 200 billion over the course of two years. So I would continue to think about that in those terms. In terms of the RMs who have left, you mentioned that we had given some numbers in the past. Yeah, I mean, that has continued just to taper. As an impact, just given the number of RMs who have left, has become sort of a non-topic at this point in time. In terms of any current period, and in terms of the assets that they’ve taken with them, it is a very small percentage, ultimately, of the given – especially given the fact that the RM workforce in Credit Suisse is down 40% from the end of 2022 levels, and we've been able to retain the lion share of the assets. So, we consider that to be sort of a story not terribly worth following, and in the end, we stay focused on our plans and our commitments."

On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that – i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I’m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over – if, assuming they do – over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage."

Even if you go down to the substance, which is, I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or everybody to understand. When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in Switzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at branch – number of branches; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense. I think we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused with market share and size.

If there were fewer than those – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes, that would be corrected to be upside. If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or two on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client behavior and our balance sheet.

Because, it is very important that de facto the vast majority of the assets are in non-core and legacy are supported by the Credit Suisse IB platform. So, as we progress in winding down the, call it, core day-to-day operation from the front office stand point of view. Whatever is left is going to be legacy infrastructure, IB infrastructure, that is only there for non-core. And so you can see out then this will be a very important element in determining how quickly we get rid of non-core assets. Because as a consequence of that, we accelerate the winding down of this operation.

One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets conservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline?",
Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,"Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to go back actually to some of the elements you have discussed on this call already, especially the NCL. Maybe trying to help us understand how much of the ROCET1 improvement towards 2026 is going to be driven by this unit, considering our move to natural runoff here, you know, trying to help us assess already at this stage what – how loss-making it is today and how loss- making it would end up being in 2026, only considering the natural runoff. And then the other question I wanted to raise is on the cost save. Just to make sure I understand correctly. So you basically have already a target of 3 billion cost saves on an annualized run rate at the end of this year. But this is compared to the end of 2022, I think. So, how much of the annualized 3 billion do you kind of already have, you know, in the 2Q accounts, please? Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Jefferies,"Yes.

Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ?

As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland."
Anke Reingen,RBC,"Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on revenue cost synergies. I mean, you had a comment and especially if you think you can keep this with market share unchanged. Is it something you really think maybe people get overly concerned and you don't see quite that risk of a revenue dissynergies even if you potentially have to contract some of this at bit more attractive rates or incentivizing your advisors? And then secondly, on slide 16 where you show us the return path and there's this block about the funding cost efficiencies. And that's something you – I guess apart from the drop out of the higher expense funding at Credit Suisse, is there other areas where you see the material benefits from lowering funding costs and overall group benefits because this block is the same size as the cost base rightsizing? Obviously can maybe elaborate a bit more on that area. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,RBC,,"Anke, on the second, –the second question in terms of material benefits, we see you obviously highlighted the most significant one, which will be just the take out of the significant cost that we were wearing in connection with the PLB and the ELA+ facilities. But, I would say, and, as I've remarked earlier, that we expect the positive contribution from the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise in our NII in 3Q and that comes principally from having stabilized the business and net new deposits that are also helping on NII. So, I would say that's another factor that is helping on the underlying profitability."
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from my side. The first, to play devil's advocate, are there more outflows to come or where you kind of already had outflows from clients, but maybe some longer-term structures, partnerships or anything like that take time to see the outflows? And then secondly, for the first time in a while, your CET1 capital is higher than your tangible book value or almost the same. So now, the 15% return on CET1, should that also be broadly similar to RoTE, going forward, or should we expect more moving parts towards 2026? Thank you very much.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Deutsche Bank,," And Benjamin, in terms of the return on CET1 versus RoTE impact, I'd say there are two factors that do argue in favor of moving in that direction, just not yet but for sure on the first one, the denominator effect we’re bigger and so that's obviously going to make the difference between the historic RoTE versus RoCET1 smaller, by definition. So – and you know that – so that denominator effect is now in play and it is helpful as you suggest probably as well, contributing to what you observe. The other one though which has been our historic delta that really has given us pause to move off of what we think is a more meaningful return measure are DTAs. But there of course, you know, as they amortize down, because these generally although not exclusively but generally relate to you know very old losses that we're you know now you know continuing to just chip away at as that balance comes down, then that's yet another factor that would argue in favor of moving to the other measure."

Amit Goel,Barclays,"Hi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time trying to update estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate, are you able to give any color in terms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you’d like it to trend? And then secondly, just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of curious things like, you know, 10 billion gross, but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that do you expect to do where you found the incremental 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also, how you're spending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. So, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well.

So, firstly, on the fair value markdowns that you've taken there, related to that, could you give an idea of the maturity remaining on these financial assets and how we should think about the reversal of those markdowns? So, you've highlighted more than 1.5 billion for the second half of this year. Is that the kind of run rate that we should be expecting going forward? And then secondly, on the NCL, perhaps I can ask it a different way. Do you have a better idea now of what the ultimate cumulative losses might be from the NCL?

And then thirdly, might I quickly ask, on the domestic side, certainly for some businesses, you will have a significant market share.

Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning it’s Andrew Coombs from Citi and thank you for taking my questions. Two if I may. Firstly, I want to turn back to follow up on the PPA pull-to-par bit in relationship to the restructuring charges. You made this comment that, out of the period at end of 2026, I think restructuring charges will be largely but not wholly offset by the PPA pull-to-par effect. And then in your later comments, you talked about probably 0.5 billion of pull-to- par effect, of which 4.5 would be noncore, and that most of that would be recognized in a three- to four-year timeframe. So, can we assume restructuring charges of the magnitude of 12.5? And can you give us a feel for the timing of those relative to the PPA pull-to-par? And then the second question is on slide 29. You provide a useful quarterly trajectory going from minus 0.3 billion in Q2 and you talked about breakeven in Q3. But you also flagged 750 million of savings, 550 million of funding cost savings. There's a 650 million arguably one-off ECL charge on the non-credit impaired CS portfolio data this quarter. So, just trying to understand the going from minus 0.3 billion to 0, even with all those additional benefits Q-on-Q, what's the offset?

Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Good morning. Let's just drill down to the areas where you've perhaps delivered ahead of expectations. So firstly, on the Non-core, another successful quarter of actively reducing the RWAs and some further gains on some of those division exits. You're now talking about narrowing that gap in the natural runoff. So based on the natural runoff you’ll be at 6% and you're aiming for 5%.

Chis Hallam,Goldman,"Sachs Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first, you've guided for banking to generate almost twice the baseline revenues by 2026 assuming supportive markets. So, obviously performance was very strong in the second quarter. But then we saw this period of elevated volatility at the start of August. Has that changed anything in terms of how close we are now to supportive markets? And how would you expect the recovery to progress through the second half of this year? And then second question, just on profitability, at the start of the year, you said you'd expect to get to around 45% of the USD 13 billion gross savings by the end of 2024, and you've got that by the end of the first half. And you also guided for mid-single-digit underlying return on core tier one this year and mid to high for next year. Consensus is at 6% for this year and 9% for next year. But in the first half you're already above 9%.

So naturally, if there's an update, we'll bring it to you and we talk about our 2025 expectations later this year.

Amit Goel,Mediobanca,"Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So one, just to follow up, just to make sure I also had some of the previous guidance correctly. And I think you mentioned the cost of the reprice on sweep to be about USD 50 million annually. And so, I mean, I guess, given the one third advisory disclosure, that would imply only, you know, just over 40 bps of incremental cost on that portion and effectively nothing on the rest. So, I mean I was just kind of curious, I mean, in a way that you could continue to see outflows, so I'm wondering what the capacity is for the group to replace that funding at similar cost? And then also just linked to that, if I look then at the total sweep and the cost of the sweep, it seems like that the earnings are pretty similar to what Wealth Management Americas generates. So I'm just kind of curious how you think about Wealth Management Americas profitability and with some of these headwinds, how you think you'll get back to that mid-teens operating margin? And then secondly, just curious on the parent, you know, is there any scope to shift exposure from foreign participations to domestic in addition to capital repatriation? And, you know, whether that can be reflected in participation values and, you know, if there is potentially will change coming.

You know, naturally when we plan the USD 13 billion of gross cost saves and the less than 70% cost income ratio, GWM factors in quite prominently in that piece of work. And that's why, you know, I've highlighted that the cost income ratio will be benefited by the work that just going to get going in the next quarter or two, which is the client account migration work and platform consolidation starting in APAC and parts of Europe before the Swiss booking center. That will drive significant cost down and ultimately, you know, which is why I believe that Wealth and P&C will benefit significantly in the latter half of the integration work. So in terms of where we get our cost income ratio, it will – GWM's cost to income ratio in the end will be a big contributor to the group meeting its target of less than 70% by the end of 2026."
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Thanks for that. This was in particular on the Americas for GWM Americas, but you probably won't see much of a cost save benefit, but correct me if I'm wrong.

I think I can only say that it's pretty difficult to track all the rumors, speculations and ideas that are coming up, almost daily. On the Swiss media, I think that I can only tell you that, that at this stage what stands is that even the Finance Minister took an official stance on the matter. I mean, those are speculations. I don't believe this is going to be part of the package. I think that - I'm convinced that Switzerland will keep its standards in terms of allowing – or responding to the crisis in March, not only the one in Switzerland, but broadly speaking, with following the recommendation that it will be set by the FSB and other bodies. And in that sense, I don't see us being particularly disadvantaged compared to any other jurisdictions in terms of a Liquidity Ordinance. So, I guess that we will follow up and I think it's going to still take months and months before the full analysis of what happened will translate into concrete actions."
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had a one big picture question on revenues and then a follow-up on the operational risk RWA. Big picture, your revenues at the minute are annualizing to low-40 billions or so. Clearly, your target has a number, which is probably USD 50 billion-plus. Just want to understand how you see the revenue bridge from here through to 2027 and what the key moving parts should be, particularly in the context of some of your GWM trends, which at the minute seem to be down before we go back up. And then, secondly, on operational risk, I just want to understand some of the assumptions that are going into your Basel IV guidance there. Clearly there's some uncertainty around ILM. There's a bit of uncertainty about what losses to use in that standardized calculation. So what losses from the Credit Suisse business are you having to carry forward and how does that impact your operational risk RWA? And then, finally, can I just clarify on the Basel 3.1 finalization guidance, is that 5% ex. any moves in operational risk?

Jeremy Sigee,Exane BNP Paribas,"Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to ask two questions about non-core, if I could. The first one on the RWA outlook, you've had a great start already reducing that balance down quite effectively. The runoff you show in the slide is effectively the natural runoff with no action, but clearly you are taking action. So, is it reasonable for us to expect that rather than being down 50%, it could be down 75% or 100% within that sort of three-year timeframe? It seems that you're on a more aggressive trajectory than that passive runoff that you're showing in the slide. And then, the second question is also about non-core, about the P&L. So you're annualizing in this quarter around USD 1 billion positive revenues and USD 5 billion of costs. I just wonder is that a representative starting point for us to sort of model non-core going forward? And linked to that, how much could that change in 2024? Could we see – will we still see positive revenues in 2024 in non-core? And how much could we expect the costs to reduce in 2024 in non-core?",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Exane BNP Paribas,," And Jeremy, on the P&L question, for sure, on the revenue side, I would not annualize the current quarter's revenues. The revenues are a function of – the market through which we would exit these positions. It depends on the nature of the positions we're talking about. It depends on market conditions. We'll be opportunistic and everything, Sergio just said that actually informs the dynamic about the speed, the timing, the intensity of when we get out of positions is, of course, what governs in that respect. So, I would put no sort of target or certain extrapolation. Certainly, no extrapolation to the current quarter's revenues in NCL is saying, well that's a run rate. On the cost side, I would argue that's different because there you're looking at – on the underlying OpEx, you're looking at, at this point, the run rate cost to support the rundown of the business. So, as that business runs down, you would expect that the costs associated, the underlying OpEx supporting the portfolio will also run down. Now, that may not be linear and I wouldn't expect it to be linear, but it ought to be somewhere in some way, shape or form correlated with the size of the balance sheet as it starts to diminish over time."

And we're hearing from US peers that there are some stabilization in sweep accounts. So I'm just trying to understand how lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially impact loan growth, as I can see it's flattish in the quarter.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,JP,,"Hi, Kian. Regarding your second question, in terms of lower rates and impact on our US wealth business. So first on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will – and I made this comment earlier in my remarks – you know, should spur additional lending opportunities across the division, including in the US. On the deposit side, in particular on sweeps, so first I'd say a couple of things, that we are seeing sweep deposits continue to taper. But in the quarter, we did have smaller outflows, so still about a billion of outflows. You know, I'd say that some of the market dynamics that I see in this regard, you know, one is that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are doing. Secondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra-high net worth. And for sure, that asset band tends to have a much lower percentage of AuM in sweeps. So that's going to be a market dynamic for us that will always weigh on, you know, that, that sensitivity, just given that with a more high net worth client base where there's more sensitivity in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally then there'll be lower balances and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see – we will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow."

Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in ‘25 versus ‘24? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the ‘24 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well?

Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Yes, hi. Good morning. So two questions from me. Todd, you mentioned some balance sheet optimization efforts that have lifted revenues over RWAs by 3 percentage points. I was wondering if you could shed some light on, you know, these measures and how much is left to come? I think in Q4, you highlighted some NII [Edit NNA] impact, and I was wondering how much of that has already come through? And then aside from the quarter, and going back to the US wealth business, in my understanding, once you get to 15% PBT and once you have done with the CS integration, you could consider some inorganic growth opportunity to further improve margins. But isn't this at odds with the Too Big to Fail proposal the way it is written at the moment, which sort of penalizes growth in foreign subsidiaries? And how do you square the two?

Thank you."," Yeah. Giulia, on the second question, I think that first of all, I think it would be premature to draw a conclusion around what the new regulation will be. Having said that, you have to balance that, you know, one aspect that has been clearly outlined by the Swiss Federal Council proposal is that their intention, or their desire, to keep Switzerland, and broadly speaking, also UBS, as a competitive global player. So I can't really see how this is possible with the, you know, with a regime that would penalize expansion globally. So in that sense, I think it's, we – as we mentioned before, we do believe that whatever the new regime will be, it will be something that fits into this strategic direction outlined by the Federal Council, and a desire to correct some aspect of the current regulation, which broadly speaking, is a very strong regulation, one of the most demanding ones when fully applied and consistently applied. That was not the case in the Credit Suisse situation. UBS is a completely different situation. We believe we have a very strong capital position, a balance sheet for all seasons, and we are able to sustain both a global business model, but also staying very close to our own markets and sustain the economy. So, you know, when we have all the facts, we will draw strategic conclusions on what to do. It's now premature to do that."

Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous,"Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one I wanted to ask is, I noticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the second quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that the rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then? And another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested in some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 360 ONE. You may not be able to comment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative of any strategic desire to shift more onshore and more into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move?

But I just wondered where you are in that process and what the outlook is for, you know, how much more reduction in advisor numbers do you expect? And is there a point at which that returns to growth mode, or does it stay in optimization mode for a continued period of time? So, advisor numbers.

Amit Goel,Mediobanca,"Hi. Thank you. Yeah. So two questions for me, also one on the US wealth business. I found it really interesting, the commentary about potentially looking at acquisitions. I guess what I'm just wondering is then, you know, from a strategy standpoint, if part of the issue in terms of operating margin is the scale and the cost base relative to the revenues, you know, is it now then the case that it's cheaper to acquire than to simply just hire? Because, you know, the US, you know, as you say, is, the focus has been on productivity, reducing FA numbers. So I'm just trying to think, is that because, you know, these 400% recruitment deals are now just too expensive to make it worthwhile, but it's actually just cheaper to buy an organization? And then secondly, just going back on the deposits and the roll-off of the fixed term deposits within wealth, I'm just curious, were those kind of written 12 months ago and, you know, were those done at, kind of, quite high rates? So just curious if there's also potentially some of that effect into Q4 and start of next year? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Mediobanca,"Hi. Thank you. Yeah.

Our priority right now is to improve what we do in the US, bringing the margins to, narrowing the margins to our peers and doing better what we have today, and then potentially by doing that, and we're going to create also the optionality and to really choose what is – fits best, is it an organic growth or is it inorganic, and what fits the best in our business model, which is asset gathering-centric. The scale issue in the US is pretty much driven by the fact that we have a banking platform, a G-SIB platform de facto as – through the intermediate holding company – that can accommodate different banking businesses, which we don't have. So again, I think that, you know, once we finish this chapter of restoring the profitability at the levels we want to be, and we fully extract the value of our investments in the Investment Bank and the collaboration between the Investment Bank and Wealth Management and Asset Management, we will determine the next phase. Now, it's really way too early to speculate."
Anke Reingen,RBC,"Hi. Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. Just two small ones on capital, please. The first one is on the core tier 1 ratio staying, I mean ex the accelerated amortization, stable quarter-on-quarter. And that's in spite of a really strong, like, profit capital generation. I mean, I realized there are a number of things going on, including FX, but is there something else we should keep in mind that only means the capital ratio is flat or you're investing more capital into organic growth? Otherwise, I guess given the strong earnings, the expectation will be the capital generation drives the ratio higher.

So, in a sense, when you look at the performance, you have to look at the third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for debt capital markets. So I think that we are very happy with the developments that we've seen in Banking and the ability to win mandates. Now, of course, we need to see if we can execute it if the market will – if the market will be there, but just very, very confident that it's a good momentum.

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements”, including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, the global economy may be negatively affected by shifting political circumstances, including as a result of elections, increased tension between world powers, growing conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will further widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including elevated inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships;

Kian Abouhossein,JP,"Morgan Yes. First of all, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the slides, I can put together a revenue picture as you're giving some details around return on risk-weighted assets in the long term, as well as your risk- weighted assets overall absolute. So, I get to about $48.5 billion of revenues, which implies around 70% cost income of $34 billion. And clearly, first of all, I wanted to see if the revenue assumption that I'm making here calculation is reasonable and what underlying scenarios you use to calculate that. And secondly, on the cost side, clearly, even if I assume some kind of growth rate in kind of cost inflation, I still see that most of the cost savings come from your legacy non-core reductions. So, it looks like a lot of flexibility. So, can you talk a little bit about – is my calculation correct to some extent? And secondly, how should I think about the cost flexibility as it seems to mainly come from Non-core and Legacy? That's the first question. If I may, just secondly, on the Investment Bank. You're clearly making a big investment push, and here I want to understand at what point do you see delivery has to be achieved. I think you mentioned end-2026 in terms of revenue improvement, but is there any milestones that have to be achieved order to illustrate that this cost income will continuously improve not just in the first quarter?",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,JP,,"Kian, vis-a-vis your second question on the IB, I think of course we do expect the onboarded resources, particularly in the banking part of the business, to start to ramp-up to average productivity of the incumbent UBS bankers. And that will happen and is already happening, to be honest, because we have been observing good mandates winning. Of course, now what we need is the second condition how do I – first one is do we win mandates? Do we get tractions? And the answer is clearly yes. So, I'm very pleased with that outcome. Now, the most difficult question to answer is, is the market going to be there to support monetizing those mandates? And you know what's going on. It's very difficult to predict the near future. So, past a very, very hard 2023 but the momentum is very good. So, I do think that is important to measure that. The other observation I tried to take on executed transaction will be are we gaining market shares? How do we do relatively to our competitors? A third element which is very important for me, how is the IB contributing to the value creation in our Wealth Management and P&C businesses because it is very, very important, is a pillar, is a very important driver and particularly now in the US but also for example in Australia, but also in APAC, in general. We can drive this real value creation by working closer together. But lastly, it will be over the cycle, can they deliver return on allocated equity, as we've said, as a target? So, it's a set of short-term and medium-term and long-term measures that we will use, but I'm confident that the trajectory we had in the last seven, eight years, which has volatility elements, will continue but in a way that accrue value to our shareholders and clients."

Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs," Thanks. So, first, on slide 28. If I zoom in on 2026, you've guided to an exit run rates of 15% return on core Tier 1. But for the year as a whole, you flagged double digit, which I guess is sort of 10% to 12%. So, just wondering if there's something specific happening later towards the end of 2026 that's causing a sort of big jump up in profitability or perhaps whether I'm just being a bit too pessimistic on assuming that double digit means 10% to 12%? And then second, on distribution. We have the details in terms of what you want to do on the dividend this year, also the comments you've made on buybacks for 2024 and for 2025, but I was just thinking about how you think about the overall payout ratio longer term, 2026 onwards, and the split in that between dividends and buybacks.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Goldman Sachs," Thanks.

On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors."
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas Exane,"Thank you. And apologies, my video is not working actually so I'm audio only. So, sorry for that. Two questions if I could. So, I think what you said about RWA reductions is very welcome, you know, and the target of $510 billion in the medium term and that frees up a lot of capital, which is really great to hear. You've talked about optimization outside Non-core, so within the core divisions, and I just wonder if you could sort of talk about that a bit more. Just give us some examples of the kind of lazy assets that you think you can cut. So, that's my first question. The second one is back on the capital returns. You talked about 2024 and you talked about 2026 on the buybacks and I just wondered in terms of how we think about what you might be able to do in 2025. Is 14% CET1 the relative – the relevant thresholds? Are there other constraints that will constrain you in terms of what buybacks you can do in 2025? So, does it have to wait for the Swiss integrations to be done? Does it have to wait for non-core milestones? If you just could talk about the constraints that would affect that, that would be great.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,BNP Paribas Exane,,"Yeah, Jeremy, in respect of share buyback in 2025, I think it's a little bit early to discuss that. But I would say that first of all, the integration, the Swiss topic, is a 2024 matter. So, by mid-2024 or during 2024 latest, we know exactly how we manage the integration of the parent company, the US entities and the Swiss operation. That will so in 2025 is unlikely to play a role in our capital return policies. The 14% is a good assumption. And what we mean by around 14% means 13.8% to 14.2%, not 14.5%. When we have excess capital, well above the 14% is because we are creating the buffer to do share buyback, to offset temporary timing differences between cost to achieve in our integration journey and the savings we realize and have the necessary buffer to also phase in the reduction of our tax rate. So, in a sense, nothing really changes but we do indeed expect also the underlying profitability to improve, and therefore potentially giving us more flexibility. But this is something that we will focus in exactly 12 months' time and we will communicate our plans for 2025."

Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we’re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Citigroup,"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.

Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you."," Okay. Yes. So, Andy, hey. I will just go on the cost side because I think I addressed the revenue side anyway in response to Kian. I would – I'd also – it's also important to point out just quickly on that slide that as we say in there, it's pre-impact from the Basel III final and model update so that, you know, also will impact on the return of RWA. In terms of the additional cost opportunities that we found, as you asked, I mean, first, I would say we're just confirming what we said last year about greater than $10 billion and saying we had to go do the work to validate all the details. And so, you know, the $13 billion that we've come out with, neither Sergio nor I think that that's, you know, going further. It was for us always the neighborhood of where, you know, we thought the plan – the detailed bottom-up plans would get us. And ultimately, when we were communicating greater than $10 billion, you know, that was an informed estimate of course because we had done a fair bit of work. But of course, all the work that we've done over the last three months validating that, you know, that number. So, that's sort of the first thing is just important to emphasize that it's not as if we've gone deeper. But in terms – so on that basis, I would just say that the $13 billion remains for us on a gross basis, critical. You know, we said half is going to be personnel related. Half is – the other half will be consisting comprised of things like mainly tech but also real estate, also third party costs. So, again, it's a validation of what we've done and also as I highlighted going through the trajectories, giving you a sense of when we think these will head through. And just quickly on the – you asked about, you know, sacrificing topline growth. I think the point that both Sergio and I have made is just of course when you do a financial resource optimization work, and we've done this before, you know, naturally to reduce the balance sheet means at times, well, you know, you're going to be sacrificing revenues as assets come down. And so, you know, it all comes down to the accretion of return on CET1 ultimately and how we think about this in terms of trade-offs. So, that's how I would respond to that. And then I think you were saying any other differences, if I took your point on CET1 and tangible equity. Was that the point that you were making the differences, I think you were saying, Andy."
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Citigroup,,"Yeah, Maybe let me just add quickly to your comment on driving optimization of the balance sheet and return on risk-weighted assets. You mentioned if we are planning to exit products, I have to say that, you know, never say never because in the next two or three years, you never know how developments work out. But at this stage, everything that we don’t deem as a product that we want to have is part of non-core. So, it's all about repricing the existing core relationships and businesses. It's not about exiting businesses. I mean, I'm talking about meaningful businesses, of course, right? So, I don't expect – it's really and that's the reason why it's not an immediate effect because we have to manage the relationship. We have to manage the discussion with clients in a way that they understand risk-reward for us, for them. They understand the value of the advice we give to clients, the services and products we give. We also have to make sure that, you know, where applicable, we stop having discounts. And so, this is over time, of course, is going to help to close the gap."
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Citigroup,,

What you see a bit is more the Credit Suisse dynamic in terms of mandates on the Credit Suisse platform and in the fact that there was a net outflow of mandates that also could be as well from relationship managers who have left. We are countering that by virtue of having now have an aligned CIO view and aligned solutions and offerings that we're bringing out to both – on both platforms. So, we expect going forward that, you know, the CS mandates that perhaps we were seeing a bit less of than ideal. We should be able to stem that issue a bit going forward from an NNFGA perspective."

So, we are willing to take a step back in terms of growth. But still in some areas, are we going to grow? Now, It's very important to understand the restructuring element up until the end of 2026.

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements This transcript contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the Risk Factors filed on Form 6-K with the 2Q23 UBS Group AG report on 31 August 2023 and the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise."
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yeah. Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,Goldman Sachs,," And Chris, on the first one, just to point out a few things that no, it's not – the change is not reflective of what we consider to be more, more complex versus less complex. Important to note that, you know, when we developed this view a year back, this was seen as a very low multiplier when you look at 13 billion of cost to achieve versus the gross cost saves that we anticipated. And we're still even with 14 billion at a very low multiplier. And so it should be seen in that light, but it's important to highlight that the changes were invited by certain assumptions we modeled a year ago and we saw changes which I highlighted in my comments earlier. But also importantly, we've identified incremental opportunities as we've worked through the integration to unlock additional shareholder value, and that's taken some incremental cost to achieve that."

On the first one coming back to the too big to fail was, I mean, you stressed a few times the potential impact on your return currently, on your current assumptions based on 14%.

You know, look, in terms of what's different, we wanted to highlight the things that we're doing now and demonstrate the initiatives we're undertaking and the plans that we have that will help us chip away. You know, we're being realistic in terms of what we think the margins can be over the mid-term, and we have a very comprehensive way at that. There is no silver bullet where there's one thing where you say that's going to effectively transform the pre-tax margin. But what I think you heard me say, and Sergio alluded to in his opening, is that we're very focused to actually across these various levers. We're implementing them all. And they're, you know, in the collective, we're going to contribute to improving the efficiency of the business. So I'd say that's our focus and that's where we look, that's the outcome we're looking to drive."

I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.","Kian, I think it's worth just pointing out that, remember, when we acquired Credit Suisse and the capital ratios at the parent bank were, you know, distressed relative to what the UBS AG's fully applied capital ratio was and the strength and resilience of our capital on the UBS side. Also to consider, you know, the equity double leverage that was there on the Credit Suisse side. And as we inherited that, the pressure it put, you know, on our own, just given what we had to address and pushing up that double leverage. So, you know, taking out the capital and rebalancing the capital from former Credit Suisse subsidiaries in, say, the UK and the US, you know, up to the parent and fundamentally at group level, as you say, has been part of the plan, but also helps to alleviate the pressure in the equity double leverage. And I think that's an important point to mention. And that's why we made the comment that, you know, if there's going to be onerous capital imposed on the parent bank, it's going to be funded with the retention of future profits."

So you've repatriated the 13 billion capital at the parent company this quarter. And despite that, your CET1 ratio at the AG level was only up 20 bps or so Q-on-Q to 13.5% now. Could you please explain why that was the case and maybe talk us through the moving parts? I'm sorry if it's a repetition, but I think it's important. And the second question is, again, a follow-up on your Swiss business. You've talked about your NII guidance. Can you just remind us your sensitivity to rates and hedging structure in Switzerland? And more in general, what flexibility would you have to mitigate some of this trend on NII with the rest for the P&L? You've alluded to more cost synergies. So if you can share a little bit more about the moving parts of the P&L, that would be that would be super helpful.

Piers Brown,HSBC,"Yes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow-ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the message correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep accounts and obviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, you're little bit below street expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just appetite for re-leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you comment that, please? And then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no change to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your favor on implementation of Basel III final that's caused a delta? Thanks.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf,,HSBC,"Yes, good morning, everybody.
