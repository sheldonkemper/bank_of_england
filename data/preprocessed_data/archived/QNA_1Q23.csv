Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment. Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the... ...elevated macro uncertainties. That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.",Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Good morning, Steve. Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is. Oh, yeah. Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital. Okay."
Ken Usdin,"Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you. Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy. Okay. Thank you very much.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those."
John McDonald,"Analyst, Autonomous Research","Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March 
 in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice? Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie 
 there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch 
 banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense 
 that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook 
 we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact."
Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve. So, as you think about all of what you've just told us 
– so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JP Morgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 
– assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting 
– given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve? Thank you.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take 
– not going to go into a lot of detail here 
– but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%. Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things. Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns 
– whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now."
Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks? No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment? Okay. Great. Thanks.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it. Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now."
Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.
In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?
Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?
Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits?
Okay, very good.
Thank you.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, Gerard.
Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption.
Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB.
But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.
No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.
Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail...
…Gerard. Sorry. Thanks."
Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue."
Mike Mayo,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.
All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?
Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what?
All right. Thank you.",Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.
And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.
Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.
And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this.
We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.
Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward.
You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity.
Yeah."
Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.
I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII...
No, hear me? Hello?
Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about 
maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that 
that's the question.
Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?
Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for those?
Got it.
This is based on the current rule set.
I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, Betsy.
Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped.
Yeah. You're back now.
Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment.
It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call 
the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.
Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it's likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it's not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces 
the holistic review. And it's going to take a lot of time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know."
Glenn Schorr,"Analyst, Evercore ISI","Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments. Interesting. Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations. What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years? Yeah. Thanks, Jamie.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us. When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers. We've got our smartest people, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference. And we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships. You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too."
Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought? Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching… Okay. All right. Thank you.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. Yeah. Yeah. Cheap."
Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Excellent. Folks, thank you very much.",Unknown,Unknown,We have no further questions.
