"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit re price and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?",John McDonald,"Analyst, Autonomous Research","Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?",Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on?,Ryan Kenny,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?",Ryan Kenny,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for-longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?",Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion, so that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us. And I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale, consumer as – remember also the Fed has the RRP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's still a trillion too.","Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mind set about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",Glenn Schorr,"Analyst, Evercore ISI","You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that.",Mike Mayo,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point...",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?",Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Can I just answer that real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put it in your comments, so everyone is going to put in extensive comments, kind of like you heard from Jeremy and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis I think is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.",Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?",Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co."
