"I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?",John McDonald,"Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.","So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?",Mike Mayo,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again? Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.",Jamie Dimon,"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.",Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that 
 somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by 
 to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Does that conclude your question, Erika?",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase",Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah.,Erika,Unknown
"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?",Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan 
 but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to 
 could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth 
 inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think 
 about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't 
 see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are 
 where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody 
 every single 
 business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-
 generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.",Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, 
 frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance 
 because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't 
 loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But  
 as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a  
 significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be 
 decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. 
 
 Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're 
 getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. 
 Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth 
 environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at 
 the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll 
 see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our 
 big long-standing investment strategies. 
 
 The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly 
 underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we 
 bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the 
 franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside 
 Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any 
 given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
"In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.",Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.","Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add? I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.","Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase"
"Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?",Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time.,Unknown,Unknown,Great. Thanks very much. See you next quarter.,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase; Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase"
