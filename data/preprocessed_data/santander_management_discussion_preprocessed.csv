video_2024_Q1_1,95,Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask José to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina.,2024 Q1,Unknown,"['thank', 'alvaro', 'yes', 'explained', 'performance',

video_2024_Q1_1,101,There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead.,2024 Q1,Unknown,"['there', 'question', 'line', 'sophie', 'peterson', 'morgan', 'please', 'ahead']",['theres question line sophie peterson jp morgan please go ahead']
video_2024_Q1_1,102,"Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.",2024 Q1,Unknown,"['yeah', 'fee', 'morgan', 'thanks', 'much', 'taking', 'question', 'also', 'wondering',

video_2024_Q1_1,105,Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be

video_2024_Q1_1,95,Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask José to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina.,2024 Q1,Unknown,"['thank', 'alvaro', 'yes', 'explained', 'performance',

video_2024_Q1_1,101,There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead.,2024 Q1,Unknown,"['there', 'question', 'line', 'sophie', 'peterson', 'morgan', 'please', 'ahead']",['theres question line sophie peterson jp morgan please go ahead']
video_2024_Q1_1,102,"Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.",2024 Q1,Unknown,"['yeah', 'fee', 'morgan', 'thanks', 'much', 'taking', 'question', 'also', 'wondering',

video_2024_Q1_1,105,Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations

video_2023_Q2_6,68,"Normally they were above 90 95 percent last quarter they were around 59 percent this quarter around 67 percent okay so it's still much better than we we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID okay and in that in 2023 we expect cost of risk to continue the normalization at around 2 percent and after two years of artificially low figures giving COVID etc as I was saying normalize levels should be below pre-pandemic cost of risk at around if remember pre-pandemic was around 285 it's never gonna get there okay because of the change of mix and what I was explaining okay in terms of the Spain okay in Spain the deposits I mean continue to be stable okay at around 200 we have around 299 billion okay we have excess liquidity in Santa and their Spain to the LTD is around 78 percent as this is the case for the whole Spanish system that is around 80 percent quarterly the claim is more you most link to CIV deposits flat in retail in the quarter despite the earlier repayments of mortgages okay it's 60 percent compared to the same period of 2022 and the increased volume of deposits moving of balance sheet products also what we see between the first half of 23 versus the first half of 22 is plus 0.9 percent okay so we have a different change of the mix with time deposits going up at around 61 percent up year and year while the mandiposis are going down around 5 percent on the back of the higher rates given by the growth of CIV which allows us to maintain also our and maintain a stable net liquidity position okay in terms of what I was saying NIA we don't expect expect to pick yet I mean we have still revisions and I will have host explained in detail exactly how we see NIA evolution in Spain morning Alvaro let me let me talk about the corporate center because and they say more than than Spain because this is going to give you a better a better view of our euro sensitivity to rates in Spain so we have assets of 330 billion 60 percent floating 40 percent fixed this fixed includes the alcohol which is 27 billion that we've been buying recently with an average duration of six years and an interest rate of over 3 percent we also have intragroup transactions etc money markets that are fixed but these are very short them so they will reprise a short term your IBOR actually goes up of the floating 200 billion 65 billion will reprise or reprises with 12 month Uribe or we expect the if we use today's 12 month Uribe or compare with the average of the first half so let's assume that the Uribe remains flat in the first half of next year we have at least 50 basis points pick up in the reprising of this part of the portfolio next year and then we have 60 sorry 30 billion with reprises with the six months 40 billion with the three months and 65 billion with one month so we will still expect significant reprising upwards in the first half of next year as interest rates in Europe may may go up once or twice but as they stabilize we will still have significant reprising of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year so obviously the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024 obviously margins will depend on the cost of deposits but we as a sector said we are not seeing any pressures today to increase the remuneration of retail deposits we are already paying almost Uribe or for CIB deposits institutional deposits but we don't see any pressures on the retail side of the deposits which means that probably the picking net interest margins will not happen until well into 2024 in the eurozone thank you all but a few questions and Jose and act of the answers can we have the next question well but the next question please come on I wanted to ask about NII in the UK and in the US if you can please update you guidance in the UK I see lending is weak falling local mortgage market is declining asset spreads at low the deposit bit I see still relatively low how do you see all this then I'm going forward and NII and also in the US you are gaining market share but are you gaining new clients or are you paying for deposits how do you see the the bit compared to the local peers and also in absolute transport and NII there in the US thank you thank you Francisco okay let me give you the details okay in the let's talk about first about the UK NII was up double digit in the first half of 23 okay it was driven mainly by higher rates and the strong focus on money in spreads and profitability although the UK tends to be more competitive than other Europeans markets as you know okay so we're putting profitability ahead of market share okay and we have a lower risk appetite but we're expecting good performance to continue leading to and nimespension okay so we expect it to stabilize towards the second half okay to end 23 with a high single digit growth on higher rates and despite the lower volumes that we have because of why you just explained about profitability okay in the second quarter NII was flatish okay higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slow down in new regions okay in terms of the betas Jose will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the US in terms of the US overall as you have seen has one better than expected even the change of mix towards prime okay as I explained in detail lower yield but also better risk profile and the lower credit provisioning is helping us okay NII is flatish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale retail as you know a lot of this is funded by wholesale as well and a common trend occurs sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have sometimes the US betas are a bobbler we expected more lower than the average of our peers just to give you exactly what's going on and we expect NII to be down mid single digit on lower regions nations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers however given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half the US NII could do better than we expect okay US NII is not the only one that has on better cost of risk and profitability are also better than expected in the country okay so Jose I don't know you can comment on the betas please in the UK when we look at the coastal deposits today relative to the level of rates today that's around slightly below 30% is increasing slightly in the quarter three percentage points we still think that I will continue so the UK is a market with less excess liquidity than Spain for instance and so we would expect as sector said margins probably there was stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flatish in the third and probably slightly going down from there in the US as sector said we kept our deposits flat paying less than our regional bank competitors the beta in the US is 36.8% up to percentage points quarter on quarter so after the spike that we saw in February March the betas in the US have remained very stable and we are actually increasing the deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors thank you Paco can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Largif from BMP Pariba XM please go ahead thanks very much for taking my questions I have two questions one is on the Spanish long book you could update a bit on the trends that we have seen in the quarter here in Geraintus here in a percent decline if you could elaborate a bit on what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward and the second question is a bit at a group level if I just look to the first half course of risk is around 106 basis points you are sticking to the guidance below 120 and is there any region besides the US what we could see some deterioration in the second half that makes it keep that conservative guidance which would imply a round rate of around 135 basis points 140 basis points in the second half to make 120 thank you thank you Ignacio let me tell you a little bit about what's the dynamics on the on the Spanish long book and then also we'll talk about your second question okay in the Spanish long book the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear okay we have seen low the amount of credit okay which is impacting us a little bit mainly also we have seen an increase on the uh prepayment mainly on the mortages okay because of the increased rates remember that a lot of a big percentage of our portfolio is some viable rates and floating rates so in that sense that's a dynamic that we have seen and also we have seen due to the increased rates the corporates and the SME's being more cautious in new credit demand okay and the dynamics we can we lived throughout the year continuing that way let's see what happens at the beginning of the year and also if we can see more confidence a little bit and investment okay but now now we see the dynamics in that way please close on the second one morning nacho cost of risk well um um we see cost of risk normalizing in the US as we discussed also in Mexico where we are seeing you know the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business the business mix uh in auto it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to to sell but it should remain stable in the second half of the year so we feel very comfortable that we will beat our 1.2 percent guidance for the end of the year we expect it to be better than the 1.2 percent that we gave us a guidance thank you nacho can we have the next question please next question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead yeah this is the fee from JP Morgan thanks for taking my questions so uh could you just explain that the difference between your reported net interesting gum which was 10.5 billion and the underlying 10.7 billion what explains that the 200 million delta and are there any more one of the net interesting gum that we should be aware of coming in in the short term and then the second question would be on on the capital head wind you mentioned that you expected to remain above 12 percent but could you just outline what capital or core x with the year one head winds you are expecting in the coming quarter or at least on the year end and also if you could remind us what the both of four impacts are thank you okay thank you Francois so Jose will explain you the NII evolution on capital let me reiterate exactly what I said and then Jose can expand a little bit so as I told you we expect to generate at least 10 basis paints of organic capital on average per quarter okay and with that is included with the current remuneration policy that we have okay so as a result what I told you we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12 percent also with the final implementation of base of three comes into effect in 2025 to be precise on that point Jose will comment a little bit more on that and explain you the NII evolution yeah so so fee high morning as I said we don't expect any head winds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could have had capital regulatory or supervisory charges in organic charges or other charges basically market related pensions in tangibles we don't see significant headwinds in the second half of the year in terms of Basel 3 we we we have seen the proposal is still a proposal so we need to wait to see exactly how is how the regulation is approved we still think we will have an impact of between 40 to 60 basis points probably and again depending on how this is finally written probably towards the lower end of that range if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved in terms of the accounting well I think investor relations will give you more details about this is pretty detailed but in the first half there is no impact no adjustments between net interest income statusory and underlying zero what happened in the first quarter is we we had an positive adjustment of 211 million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter which by the way in in in terms of the 20 billion it's a very small amount so no adjustment to NII in the first half where we added to underline in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter there are other adjustments in the PNL but basically netting out in most cases what happened in the first quarter in the second quarter but investor relations will give you all the details land by line of the differences between the first and the second quarter thanks Sophie thank you Sophie can we have the next question please next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from city please go ahead thank you very much my first question is on the digital bank but you please provide an update on your strategy for gathering the positive here you've raised roughly 3.4 billion year today that seems a bit below what you had planned a few months ago you're not supposed to raise your shoes running at 200 percent so how much more deposit do you expect to get and where do you feel like you need to put rates in order to be to be more successful in in northern europe and and germany the second question is follow up on mortgages in the UK you are shrinking pretty fast for billion at per quarter when do you expect to stabilize that book thank you thank you Marta okay on the study of the open bank is quite clear okay and we just don't have open bank as the only vehicle to raise the deposits we have some other vehicles also we have in some of the other different countries okay we believe that the study is right and the one that we're managing to open bank is going along our expectations and we believe that we're going to continue to manage that accordingly okay and in the some other different initiatives that we have for example in germany and some other places the study has been proven very successful and we don't believe we need to basically continue racing rates depending on what the market reacts to it okay so we're going moving it according to the market in terms of mortgages in the UK I was very specific about what we're thinking in terms of profitability okay and the way we're managing the portfolio first of all we've been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk appetite is being very prudent in the way we're managing the UK okay if we see that is there is a change of of how we see the market then we'll adjust at the point but right now we're concentrated in the two things I told you first of all profitability and being cautious on the risk appetite there if we see on of these changes then we'll adjust in any way I don't know if you'd like to comment that you'd be more in the digital consumer bank now includes shopping bank we have 60 billion in the process like you said and I think we obviously manage that to maximize profitability so not only a question of the amount of deposits but the question is managing managing the margins in a business that has negative sensitivity to rates and I think we've been very successful if you compared this figure to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and interracency sensitivity management I think you have to look at the the whole picture and I think we've been very successful in managing interracency sensitivity in a business that is naturally that has naturally negative sensitivity to rates thanks Marta thank you Marta can we have the next question please next question from Andrea Filetri from Media Banka please go ahead yes I can question what is it to get more clear and basically in H2SD one you go into the different geographies and particularly you're given a lot of detail on NII in a lot of countries can you do the same for Brazil please the second question is on Spain if you could split the drivers of NII there between feet of increasing interest rates of the posi beta and the alcoop portfolio contribution thank you okay thank Andrea let me explain a little bit the NII in Brazil and then Jose will give you the details of the drivers of NII and the beta scene Spain okay charging yeah in Spain so to start I mean Brazil NII okay performance here is a quarter is explained first of all on loans since 2021 I have been very specific on that we have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix okay and we have loans volumes electively okay changing the low mix the the low mix to lower risk on the posits okay the fast increasing rates main the rapid rise on the cost of the posits okay we expect NII in the second half of 23 to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with substantial improvement in 24 okay if we see that the rates basically start to come down because it's very important to understand that Brazil has negative sensitivity to the rates we should gain traction and we maintain we're going to maintain a cautious stance but we believe that we can go back to the market okay and we believe that the facial rates could fall in the second half bringing in the cost down in retail funding okay and then in the drivers of NII in Spain and and also we'll give you more details Spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates okay we continue to see strong growth in clients just in the first half of the year we have 300,000 more active clients okay NII in Spain is up around 57 percent in the first half of the year and 60 percent just alone is a second quarter is mostly supported by reprising of the Lomportafolio the higher yield yields and are remained contained on the cost of the posits so we have been managing very well in that sense we expect double digital growth for NII in 2023 and regarding the peak of NII in Spain there are several things to consider that Hoss already explained you assets will continue to reprise at least during the first half of 24 clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas which will be key are we're still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid okay so as of today we don't expect much high remuneration on the foreseeable future so hi Andrea the alcohol in Spain we have 27 billion alcohol 21 billion is a structural long time held to collect with an average maturity of duration of 7.7 years and a yield of 3.3 3.4 percent and then we have 6 billion which is more associated with short-term liquidity management average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below 3 percent and we expect to continue increasing the amount of the alcohol portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak we don't want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates so one way of doing that is not only we are also taking other measures but one way is obviously increasing the alcohol portfolio in terms of betas the beta for the position of Spain is 17.8 percent if we exclude CIV by the way this is 3 percentage points higher than in the first quarter if we exclude CIV the beta is 9.5 percent the beta in CIV is around 60 percent so I think I've given you all the numbers to to figure out exactly you know how we see the betas and the NIA going forward thanks thank you Andrea can we have the next question please next question from Blita Smith from autonomous please go ahead yeah hi there thanks for taking my question could you give a bit more color on the NIA increase the absolute NIA increase in Spain Q and Q the customer spread was up less in the previous quarter but NIA was up a lot more and then secondly could you also update us on the net interest income sensitivity in Brazil over one year and two years and lastly on the 500 million rate benefits that you see more so than previously can you give us an idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current one way thank you okay so let me go backwards here yeah in in the first half the sensitivity was more or less 500 million higher than what we the guidance we gave in at investor day we would expect more or less a similar amount in the second half in euros so we relative to the figures we gave at investor day the interest rate sensitivity in euros due to the fact that obviously rates are higher and we are seeing better betas remember that the betas we use to give that sensitivity at investor day in euros were around 30 percent we are below 20 percent right now and is already half of the year so we would expect another 500 million more in the second half over a billion higher than what we mentioned at investor day and I have sensitivity in Brazil I'm going to give you the rest of the of the currencies as well so if today we had a hundred basis points parallel shift upwards we would make 1.1 1.2 billion more in euros 250 million more in the UK flat slightly negative in the US and a hundred million less in Brazil I think we gave you all the details to understand the NIA sensitivity in Spain but we can take it offline and if you want to you know more detailed analysis but I think we gave you all the details I give you the composition of the balance sheet by by repricing on the asset side so I think that's sufficient I think but but we will take it we will take it offline thank you breter can we have the next question please I think we are much forward taking my questions just a quick follow up from him capital you mentioned the stock financing factor can you please quantify that in terms of stock and and one thing or specific impact on Greece with it assets just to clear that out from all the impacts thank you okay so the stock stock finance is seasonal it tends to go up in December which is the peak in the year then goes it goes down in March go shop a little bit in June and then same in September to pick again in December this year the increase in June was higher than we expected we are talking around six billion in in total risk with the assets from stock finance in in the first half thank you Carlos can we have what I believe is the last question please and if anybody wants to add another question please press star five on your phone thank you next question from Fernando Gildes Antivanias from Bestember please go ahead all right thank you for taking my question two questions please one is important let me expect in terms of mortgage provisions related to free funds come forward you can come with another use of capital and second moments on other your growth I'm looking at UK figures and polar figures and looking at loans loan growth and FIACs in fact it seems like other years are increasing faster than that and you can comment on why it's happening that in those particular changes we're having a lot thank you very much okay sorry Fernando what you said at the beginning was mortgage provisions in Poland yeah okay so Fernando let me tell you exactly how we are in Poland okay up to today okay and with the extra that we did okay we believe that is completely adequate okay we're talking about that in the blended provisions that we have we are provisioned of to 58% okay of the outstanding that we have okay and we believe that's enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there given the dynamics that we have seen in the market and if you basically changing to a slotis when these mortgages started they be about there okay so I believe that to wear at the right point and and we believe the provisions at this level is completely adequate okay on the second I will have Jose no as I explained a long growth year was zero a risk weighted assets increased to percent half of which is FX and I can take you through the composition of risk weighted assets by country but half of the risk weighted asset inflation has to do with FX of the other half we had some positive some negatives as I said we have contraction in the UK we have contraction in terms of risk weighted assets X stock financing auto and slight contraction in Europe and then we had the stock finance expansion in Europe and also risk weighted as a growth in in X effects in Mexico and in Brazil thank you Fernando I'm unclear if there are any further questions we have a question from the line of Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS please go ahead yeah hi good morning sorry it's just a quick follow up on on Brazil if you can give us a little bit more color or at least ballpark magnitude of the substantial growth of NIA you're respecting in in 24 and the sensitivity to rates Jose was mentioning suggests probably around yeah 1% for a hundred basis points decline so just trying to understand basically what kind of magnitude in terms of acceleration of NIA you are expecting next year in Brazil thank you okay thank you Ignacio I will answer the first part of the question and then Jose will help me out with the rest okay this is a sensitivity what I told you is that we believe that the worst is over in Brazil okay and we're starting to see a little bit more growth in the portfolio okay so we're changing that around we're starting to basically go back to the open market which you know in 21 we decided basically to come out of it given the what we saw in the current environment okay so at this point we believe that Brazil is going to be able to turn around and also we see that the rates are going to be helping us out because we believe that already in August should start coming down so in that sense we don't know exactly how the trends are going to work but we see that is this is coming much better than we expect okay and we see that we're going to end up the year basically flat dish to where we do where we started okay so hi Natu we believe interest rates in Brazil will start coming down in August they are at 1375 our central scenario if is for rates to end the year at around 12 12 and a quarter and then probably below 10 by the end of next year so NII when you look at sequentially quarter on quarter NII probably will be flatish in the third but it should increase in the fourth and more so into next year and the exact sensitivity I mentioned the sensitivity to a higher rates but the sensitivity in Brazil to a hundred basis point but this is a parallel shift I insist the parallel shift which is not what will happen probably because we are what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve but flatish in the long end of the curve but through a parallel shift a drop in a hundred basis points will generate 140 million higher revenue in Brazil thank you Natu thank you Natu I believe there are no for the questions so thank you everybody for your attendance and the investor relations team is that your disposal for any other questions that you may have thank you very much",2023

video_2023_Q4_8,83,What is the advantage that the global footprint will give Centunder in terms of that in translating into course growth and should we just expect that the efficiency again will continue towards say 42 in 2025 which if I remember correctly was the target of the strategy plan so we are not yet at the end of the journey we are just filled in in the process of that in that.

video_2023_Q4_8,84,Remember we've started a very strong year guidance for the three years was high single digit revenue with delivered double digit. What's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe of course with a with a higher rate but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses.

video_2023_Q4_8,89,"Sure, thank you.",2023 Q4,Unknown,"['sure', 'thank', 'you']",['sure thank you']
video_2023_Q4_8,90,"Okay I mean you going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail CIV and consumer as Sanatol you know mid-singular digit and positive revenue growth in 24 you're going to see a little bit of the regions basically Europe moderating because of the rates and but we don't expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago you're going to see also that the main driver will be South American what's going on in Mexico and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the US okay so in that sense you'll see also the consumer business globally and then I have both in Europe in the US to grow benefited by credit growth and the progressives repricing that we have okay and you're going to see in CIV high income from financial transactions all right but asking you I mean answering your question in terms of fee we expect the income to grow and that's very important as Sanat was saying supported by a study of being the number one banktor for a customer this is quite important the moment that you become the number one bank to your customer fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially and that's going to help us quite a lot you can figure out a lot about connectivity several times but let me tell you why it's very important okay connectivity between the global businesses platforms and the countries is the one that drives extreme free generation okay that basically leads to double digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in 24 so we can reach the me to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees okay so that's very important and going to cost I don't know if I can come very quickly or if you want to come in Dana let me just give a high level and then maybe give a bit more detail so basically what's important in cost is that we we want to do better in cost next year than this year we're aiming for I would say flat-touch cost so the goal is to grow customers grow top line have positive operating leverage of flat-touch cost that is below 43 percent by the end of 24 you also said how do we see it in 25 obviously we see it better we as I said we intend to go step by step sustainably getting better we've had big improvements in 2324 we expect also improvements in 25 and reaching at least our target if not better I'm not changing the guidance I'm just saying we should do better than that so I want to be clear on that but yes we see many more benefits so and I want to again insist on the structural change in the model and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do we're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio but the cost to serve the customer we see a very very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year and we hope to carry that we have positive momentum in all our markets and again as I use the example of the US because the US is the place where we have an at-scale auto business but with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks we will get to be very competitive on the asset sorry on the deposit coloring side you saw in the in the slide that Ektor showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the US by 25 we've delivered 200 million this year we are of course investing investments in the US transformation will not be as large next year so you are going to see a much better performance for the US as a whole in the in 25 but what I said before we will migrate our existing retail customers in 25 to this new platform so in 25 and again this is only one example with the US driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running which is in the regulatory approval process so that should drive increased efficiencies and then again in Ektor slide you saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology so our investments one transformation investments in technology have reached 2.4 but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform so again we are we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and we'll get better you want to give it a bit more in the one transformation I think this is one very important point Ignacio to remember it about I mean one transformation is not just about the platforms there are two steps before it which are quite important where you see the impact on the cost one is simplification have you have seen in one of them as slides you saw the amount of products that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization okay so that's very important as simplification then the second is automation which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling products etc and also diminishing the cost ultimately means better service user experience less cost per transaction and client more revenue which is basically means profitability and then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through 24 25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Thompson from RBC please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my questions you've guided for UK Nimm to be down in 2024 can you quantify how much Nimm pressure you'd expect materialize this year in the UK versus the Q4 exit rates or if it's easier express this as an percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023 and secondly your structural hedge notion when the UK increased by seven billion or seven percent quarter on quarter that compares to a fall in current accounts of about 1.6 billion that's a little counterintuitive can you explain that this is driven by growth and savings deposits or rather is it because you manage the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than the catapetra approach and could you guide us please for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notion in the UK in 2024 thank you so yes let me just frame the answer in in terms of the UK Nim in the context of our retail business so again our overall retail business for 24 will do better than 23 driven more by the Americas in this case both Latin America but also the US because it's on the consumer side actually so what's very important is again single mid-single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall with mid-single digit growth overall también also for that interesting come within that the UK who this year has delivered a 13 I believe 13 percent ROT will continue to be double digit but will be lower profitability so as you as you know volumes and the top line net interesting come and let actor and Jose give you a bit more detail on that but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability so we have a very strong business in mortgages very strong business in current accounts in the in the UK at scale and competitive and for 24 we expect still double digit profitability but lower than this year what's important and again as we think about the one transformation that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the US in terms of the top line but it's going to help already on the coast side so we're guiding UK should be flatish cost next year with low cost of risk in a very very strong balance sheet and and so again leading to lower profitability overall in the UK but still double digit ROTE so in terms of I don't even want to give a bit more detail on volumes on on them in the UK sure I will do so but mainly I think it's important to tell you a couple of things asana said basically RITEL represents the bulk of the business in the UK mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have we anticipate in terms of you question in terms of cost flatish cost this is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing and also we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you okay it's important to understand that high rates and economics low down are continue to affect the long volumes and the market deposit growth continue to be so do okay so in 24-ganties it paid a challenging competitive environment as a one that you've saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks which is basically what's going on there mortgages rates have started to fall in December 23 you saw that following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then so we see a little bit changes in the in the volume the outlook is doing by increased competition also which will keep focusing on profitability as as Anna basically said and we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost at better levels and to find new revenue streams cost as I said flatish and as are we sold we anticipate and it's low and it's lightly lower ROT but I don't know Jose if you want to be the stock details yeah on the on the hedge in the structural hedge now I think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis it very much it may suffer some volatility due to materials etc if we look at the structural hedge in December 22 it was 108 billion pounds it is now 106 billion pounds and at that time the duration was 2.5 years and is 2.4 years that shows this very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable this is a structural so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits but again this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and like you said linked to our interest race sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts thank you can we have the next question please next question from Antonio Realio from Bank of America please go ahead morning it's Antonio from Bank of America I have two questions please one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy so you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 16% charity which implies an appropriate of more than 12 billion on current tangible value and this one has been growing so we hope that continues so it'd be implicitly guiding between 12 and 12.5 billion a profit they say which would be I mean it would be a strong number if delivered now I want to ask you to confirm if that's right but it would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year particularly Europe Brazil and the US actually when you talk about Europe if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness with this quarter that I think would help my second question is on strategy so you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the US and now over the years we've seen a few European international peers have ambitions change the allocation of capital industry AB businesses in the US which is almost systematically resulted in negative jobs and higher capital consumption can you talk us through what your expectations are here please and possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments thank you so in terms of the guidance again we're not going to give specific numbers but you can do the math I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues you know profits cost etc is that the key here is the operating leverage as I said this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control we control the top line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts and so what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model so we have a structurally lower cost to serve so we're going to work very hard on both of those as you know we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business so if you allow me I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage this is how we predict we have been managing this way forever by the way at the country level so we've been predicting retail commercial by country it's not anything different we're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that actor explain in detail so again we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 24 this is really important so we expect revenue growth in all our businesses retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80 percent so it's obviously very important both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single digit again our retail commercial as I said will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe but with exception of the UK the top line will grow in all the countries including Spain so revenues will continue to grow in Spain poll and Portugal so again very diversified and I would say very strong momentum in some cases more now fees than net interest income actor mentioned on the retail commercial side fees were negative to to flat this in 20 and 23 it should be much more positive in 20 in 24 including in Europe by the way because there's more activity we're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up so fees should grow in retail commercial what's going to be doing better and actor and I mentioned that already is our consumer business DCB and that is both in Europe and in the US so again here both net interest income and revenue growth should also should continue to grow fees growing much faster because of a higher activity so again very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more sensitive positive sensitive positive sensitivity to the to the lower rates the corporate investment bank will continue to grow very well mostly on fees as you've seen there we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not we're not planning to increase the size of the business we just wanted to be more profitable but not the size in terms of capital so that should remain basically where it is today it's a 13% of our revenues but the composition of our business is really different from our peers so a lot of transaction of banking a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with I mean both actor and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new in this new context right so we are very very focused on on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing what we are not either the best or could be the best at and and leveraging on our corporate relationships which are incredibly strong across Latin America Europe and increasingly the US so that is really the focus of the strategy there in terms of most specific guidance on specific countries I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more thank you thank you can we have the next question please next question from Carlos cobo from the state general please go ahead hi thank you for the presentation with a couple of questions from me one is on please and I'm sorry if you touched on this already feel free to refer to the call because I couldn't connect and to do simply the thing is that feeling going with the area where you have sort of under delivered the new premises stronger growth and fits how long only grown by mid-sing of the year 2023 I would like to understand why what do you think that was the case and where you bullish for 2024 were you again as back to grow by high single digits and understand the hiring in the US but all on that what is driving that is strong growth growth across the world and the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer best which retail it's just the quality of this comparative it we're looking at feeling like cost income ratios in both segments where you feel it would respect the digital consumer to be a more efficient business line than retain within network could explain what extent the cost income ratio in the digital consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development and will be a more normalized cost income ratio thank you so let me just very briefly answer the second question you're totally right there's a lot of upside in our in our consumer business remember that this is mostly Europe but also the US so we invested a lot in this especially on the retail side sorry on the wall retail and consumer the the the bank side is exactly the same back end but you're totally right so that should improve a lot next year so we actually targeting lower cost absolutely for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the US so yes absolutely that is a big goal we have fees so again we you know we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said but we're going to deliver because diversification because we're working on different angles and so you're going to get some lags one of the reasons you know our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity especially in Europe in some markets and that is a big driver of fees we accept we're targeting fees in our retail commercial to to turn positive next year so from zero growth this year as you saw an extra presentation that should be up maybe not much we're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank again as we said our diversification is a huge strength it's differential against most of our peers if not all of them so as rates stabilize and come down you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business not just on the cost side as I just explained but also in you know revenue growth net interest income and fees and fees should be you know high single digit in our consumer bank which is pretty big and yes absolutely our corporate investment bank should grow fees much faster that is one of the goals that is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the US because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships so you're going to see CIP fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year double digit for sure and you're going to see a lot of that in the US again so you will see the US as a country both consumer doing better CIP doing better the whole of the US going to you know above double digit returns next year but again it's and you're going to see hopefully hopefully you see payments also doing very well this year and next year and wealth management doing better next year than this year so that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in 24 thank you can we have the next question please next question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead yeah hi this is the fee from JP Morgan so my first question would be on US as a quality if I look at the NPL ratio in the US it increased from 4.2 to 4.6 coverage from 73 to 68 growth of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points if I look at the second hand core values that dropped over 30% since big value and in addition you're doing more eb financing as far as I can see given that tax right given that you had heard something at 20,000 eb vehicles in the US I think of 80% discount and the second hand core price is coming down so much and as a quality already showing signs of deterioration how should we think about the cost of risk in the US going forward and if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is and then my second question would be on the corporate center as far as I can see the first time you make a profit in the corporate centers in the global financial crisis you also made a positive net interest income in the corporate center so how should we think about the contribution from the corporate center going forward thank you okay let me take a couple of these high level and then I'll pass to Jose and actor but in terms of asset quality I want to say we see no signs of asset quality deterioration at all we are guiding and we're confident that cost of risk will stay around 1.2 that is probably a through the cycle number roughly so it could be lower it could be a bit higher but it should be a 1.2 we're not seeing really we had set previously 1% through the cycle we have a bit bigger balance sheets in in some emerging markets but you know we haven't given this but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that but I'd say around 1.2 what's important is that and this is not just Europe but it's mostly Europe a balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured in the case of Europe a lot of that is mortgages so 33% actually about total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs we're not anticipating a big change in in those numbers maybe a few basis points yes that's why we as you know the 1.13 is the underlying so we do have some space to grow there but this really is about basis points and the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolio is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet so again we are confident the economy will remain resilient if you look at the latest actually today the IMF just upgraded growth especially for Spain and some of our key economies and then our consumer portfolios and maybe actor wants to come into a bit more in the US but yes there will be some normalization but to be honest everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios Brazil is trending down the US is normalizing as we expected there will be some normalization in consumer next year but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year a led actor answer on that but let me just address the corporate the corporate center maybe that's for Jose but just to say that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center so in the corporate center for example we place our excess liquidity with ECB then we have transfer pricing and so again you should see some of that and I let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business for example in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal again part of that is let's say more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose and our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market-based transfer pricing and so you can see the actual commercial business and so some of those financial benefits of higher rates sometimes in our case as you've seen this year go to the corporate center so maybe you want to take the US maybe autos and then Jose you want to also expand on the corporate center sure so I mean really quickly on the US now our the US altowitnesses that we have has shown a very robust growth in 23 saves volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new relationship we have with some new OEMs that we have included in the portfolio and we have as you know a continued dominance in the Supreme Use Car segment which we are the leaders in the market now this volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained okay and also compensated for some declines from volumes that we had in other OEMs okay and then you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with the lead-wences and losses increasing seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter but it's still below the pre-pandemic levels okay so we expect the performance to continue through 24 and we see lower role rates of charge-offs and lower the link-wences driving that of the ship that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally US recovery in the US economy so Rob I wouldn't say recovery but robust US economy new vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre-pandemic period and just prices are falling but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have remember that is playing last quarter about about after 90 days the link-wences will still below pre-pandemic levels are about I mean 67% compared to about 90% so our outlook for 24 is a positive on the US auto sales growth in both loans and leases and a sustained income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term so we don't expect basically cost or risk to deteriorating the US sofi the NIAI of the Co-Presenter the NIAI of the Co-Presenter basically comes from the relationship between the Co-Presenter with a balance sheet in Spain and there are two different balance sheets in Spain one is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an independent bank so we charge to Spain the TILAC emerald costs which are the financing of the alco portfolio and a couple of other things so net commercial Spain balance sheet which are around 1.4 billion for those items and then we also have a CIV balance sheet in Spain that's group CIV booked in Spain plus the branches and like canna said we isolate the CIV business from interest rate risk so there is a an intra group transfer pricing for the CIV business that that is in the balance sheet of Spain and that's around 800 million so although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and the position of 308 billion the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate but then we charge these items that I explained making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIV against the TTI so obviously when rates are up we have at the Co-Presenter higher income from the TTI coming from CIV as rates will come down that should also come down thank you can we have the next question please next question from Francisco Riquel from Alanda equities please go ahead yes good morning I want to ask about the capital and I wrote the 60% you stick to your 50% payout ratio but yet the capital bill built is limited in 24 as per your guidance so I wonder what are the regulatory impacts that we should expect if any or what are the moving parts are impacting the 24 capital ratios and second here is the the 12% capital target the CET1 has been raised by 75 basic points in the last two years to 9.6 so regulatory escutors impose further counter-secular buffers so in this context do you think that the 12% capital target was Basel IV is still valid or would you be looking to increase this bar over time thank you so in terms of capital we are very comfortable with our level of current capital it's over 12% not 12 and just very important it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel III so again really important that we are comfortable we have ample buffers in terms of of the regulatory requirements the second point is that every year we're generating more and more capital organically we are compound we're compounder we're adding to equity and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important so this is allowing us enough capital to grow we have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet so as you can see the net AW growth last year was zero but increasing the front book profitability and so again we're aiming to in terms of capital build this year on a like for like basis we went from 12 to 1250 we're now accruing the buyback in December so that means 1230 that goes up from 12 and that's after increasing the payout to 50% as you know from 40 so again we're generating more and more capital we generated 10 billion of capital this year it's much much larger than the last few years we continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund out growth increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital and next year we will have the Basel 3 but the number that we're projecting for the end of this year is 1240 to 1250 from the 1230 for the end of 24 we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one again 1240 to 50 by the end of the year and on day one in January the same the final impact in 28 we estimate 25 30 basis points so that would mean that on January the first 25 we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road with the 1240 to 1250 that I'm saying anything else on the requirements you want to say on the P2R and P2G because no back very quickly we will generate between 10 to 15% of organic capital per quarter and we expect to have around 30 35 basis points of regulatory charges of which 20 will be up I mean front loading Basel 3 so that's why by the end of December 24 the ratio that we will publish will be already fully basal 3 compliant as Ana just explained and the capital ratio of 1240 to 1250 will be the same on December 31 and on January 1st 25 because we will not have any impact from Basel 3 on day one that impact will be absorbed in 2024 and in terms of the 12% and headroom well you know we're I believe one of the few European banks that under the stress test doesn't reach MDA I mean there's not very many the headroom is very comfortable we have hundreds of basis points I never know if we've given this number or not but we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic our risk appetite and the regulators so we're comfortable with our with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis which again we don't think that is the only number we should look at but on a nominal basis 12 months from now we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis a vis appears thank you can we have the next question please we are running a little bit out of time so can you make them as specific as possible thank you next question from Andrea Fri 3 from Mediapanca please go ahead first question is on the NII prospect have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the NAA trajectory in your representative geographies can you please update us on your net trust income sensitivity with the forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration the second is a more conceptual question you hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability while capital is growing yet a consensus estimate are hesitant to meet your guidance and valuation stays on demanding what do you say to the skeptics on something there thank you what I say to the skeptics look at and what I tell everybody every time they evaluate something is look at the numbers look at the track record if you look at a track record that's why I showed a slide by the way the NII will answer Jose will answer that on the hedge but basically it's I think you know we we have gotten some recognition this year way we need way way more absolutely you know we are distributed to shareholders 10% of our market value 5.5 that is five times to shareholders what we gave nine years ago but very importantly on a per share basis as we said this year we're up 50% as we increase the payout 50% cash dividend per share I mean any number you look at is at the group level is I think sorry to say this but impressive but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years so what I would say is just look at the numbers and that's what we're doing look at a track record look at a model look at our diversification I think it's going to be and you know as we are preparing for this call if you look at the group by global business it's a much more simple to understand group but very importantly by managing the bank now by five global business we have a lot more upside for many more years and this is the key the market will see this year we're launching our own tech platform in the US this is totally differential for the US of course but also for the group there is and and this is really important a plan to deploy as Ektorset common business model common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank so you know as well you know the numbers your recommendations are higher I think you're still way short by the way of how we see things but that's fine so you're not even half as bullish as we are we own a lot of shares and I think just to answer the last question the market tends to look and this is the feedback we've got from a couple of long-term Santander investors they look at us through the rearview mirror and if you look at Santander through the rear view mirror the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension and not all our peers but our goal is to outperform all our peers don't get me wrong is 23 and what they tell us is you need two years of consistency and you will see that I am very confident we will see that Ektor and I are working together really well we like what we do we believe in this company we have a great team we just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run an open bank platform we're going to deploy our national digital platform in the US this year all our customers from our current retail bank in the US will be on the new platform in 25 so just you know we'll keep on delivering and we'll keep on buying shares at 18% ROI so I'm sure this is something which we'll get to Jose can you answer the instructions Andrea and I and Prospect sensitivity etc you're right we have a hedging of our very more mortgages which is basically expired already it will expire in by April it will expire so the sensitivity that we're going to have next year it's going to be the actual sensitivity of the portfolio there are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity one is let me give you the sensitivity to a drop a parallel drop of a hundred basis points in Spain it would be minus one billion all things being equal another way of looking at it is the way you post the question which is if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024 which is probably not realistic NIA is positive around 500 million okay so so we will still have positive reprise in next year with costs of deposits remaining flat but again that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion so I give you the minus one billion a hundred basis points drop by 500 million with cost of deposits flat thank you can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Fereto from UBS please go ahead yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions too very quick ones first one is if you can give us your best approximation of what to expect from Argentina in terms of earnings in 2024 and the second one if you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the UK and if you can give us your view of how that this cash basically can develop and what kind of restructure and charges you know impermanence actually might have to face in 24 and 25 on the basis of this thank you so Argentina a bank in Argentina is doing incredibly well obviously the exchange rate has meant a few basis points of effect on a capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers I believe for next year and how we're going to report is going to be leaving Argentina in current so you can get a better view of what really is going on so this is really important we report in constant when you look at the performance of the business but we leave Argentina in current in terms of the P&L it's not really material except for this volatility across the from no and the effect on capital was a few basis points I think two three basis points in Q4 Argentina we we're not anticipating nothing very different for for the next year in terms of the UK it's still early days it would not be a significant I mean we I'm going to say it's a significant we don't really know but it should not be a big number because it's not a really big portfolio FCA is looking into it so nothing really that right now we're concerned about thank you can we have the next question please next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley please go ahead hi thanks for taking my questions to two quick ones hopefully on Brazil obviously very strong growth in NII can you maybe talk us through that strong growth I see the cards seen a pickup in growth maybe you can update us where you are in that card growth strategy in versus your your the run rates you've given us in the past and will the 100% cap on rate on loan rates how will that affect you in in 2024 and second very quick one can you give us what tax rate you're assuming for your 2024 and 25 targets and any color you can give us in particular in Brazil and the US for how how to think about in those regions thank you so let me answer this quite a few questions I'm going to answer very high level and we can then address some of the others in the coming quarters but basically Brazil is as you know as you've seen it's doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters we're expecting a much higher profitability in 24 in the high teens actually cost actually growing less in in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in Brazil we can grow and actually grow our cost-based less because we're investing together revenue growth net interest income you know between double digit and yeah all double digit growth in all the top line and efficiency ratio improving again so very strong performance anticipated for 24 across all the different global businesses but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards just I don't think any you want to say about cards all I can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually 18 months ago you seeing that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down we anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year and that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards we will start to grow again but again the growth in Brazil is across all the global businesses not just the retail but also the consumer CIV and all the others in terms of the tax rate for 24 no I mean just one one comment on growth in Brazil if you look at the consumer finance which includes everything in Brazil this year it was the portfolio together we say I did agree the least just 2.2 percent and obviously as rates come down that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average so if we are expecting more or less you know very low double digit growth in loans in Brazil next year this portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average and we would expect corporate loans corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average so that shows the change in mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion together with the sensitivity that we have to rates on the tax rate I don't know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards you can follow up Jose or Boronja but there is an effect in the tax rate from the which is actually a business business line of business quality revenue because of the electric vehicles in the US you're seeing that some of that already in Q4 it's actually as I say it's a business but you're seeing that through the through the tax line so that maybe you want to give some color on that later on thank you can we have the next question please next question from Marta Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much my first question do you expect positive jobs in the US in 2024 and then I guess you are in 2025 I'm interested in 2024 and then second following up on your strategy in the UK you're shrinking you're saying that you is going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposit but you're expecting your group platforms to watch the revenue line over time I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the end point in the UK is because of the industry could have claimed beneath a bank you gathered the deposits you give mortgages in a very challenging and a very competitive environment so unless you throw money into your UK business you're not going to do anything so what is the plan thank you so the answer in the US yes absolutely we're expecting positive jobs in the US so we are basically growing the top line in revenues more or less flat fees efficiently racial improving cost flat to flatish I would say and I just wrote it that is actually a 12% going up in a quite a significant way so yes absolutely positive jobs in the US in terms of the UK strategy and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries and these are the UK and the US where our US we call it it's in retail because we have current accounts of mortgages but I would say it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal Spain Mexico Brazil and that is really the strategy so actors working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually you know focus on profitability so we are not as you say I think use the word throwing and we never throw capital around with total respect we are super efficient and we focused on profitability not just in the UK but across and we are putting as you can see more capital at work in the more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets very important this is a very granular work that is actually led by Ektor and Jose where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability UK is one of them so again full focus on profitability you can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain for example you can see that in the front book that actor showed the front book this year is above 2% 2.3% raw oil I remember correctly we are being very disciplined again not just by countries and global businesses even by portfolios and this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years all right um so we're going to take the last question now um we do realize that there are a couple of others in the queue but the investor relations team will be at your disposal for any for any questions that you may have so can we take it the last question please last question yeah I think so thank thanks so can you hear me yes go ahead please oh thank you um yeah first of all thanks for still disclosing the the country reporting which is very useful to us as analysts thanks for that my question relates to the to the customer growth which was one of the KPI's to drive scale effects you've added 5 million customers 265 the target is 200 million until 2025 to what extent this is dependent on the rollout of the fully digital offering and to what extent without then backload some of the revenue growth that you expected to see until 2025 so yes absolutely in a consumer bank especially the deployment of the platforms including senior and euro should drive a much faster more customer growth in the next few years but very important sometimes I mean our definition of customers is net customers so some of our peers give gross customer we give net customers and so again as we improve an actor mentioned that several times as we improve our service our experience and become the number one bank customer rotation should be less on the retail side we should accelerate the consumer growth but in any case the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues whether and again think that the revenues are coming with the active customers more than total customers so total customers drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank and that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years so I think there's a few more if you don't mind begony on the team we'll address those again thank you all very much I just want to reiterate actor and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about continued delivery on our targets and we see an even better 24 for Santander thank you very much",2023 Q4,Unknown,"['okay', 'mean', 'going', 'see', 'main', 'drivers', 'growth', 'going', 'retail', 'civ', 'consumer', 'sanatol', 'know', 'midsingular', 'digit', 'positive', 'revenue',
