1Q23,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah, good morning, everyone. I am happy to be back here with all of you. And it is an honor and privilege to lead UBS once again, especially at such a pivotal time for our organization and for all our stakeholders. First of all, I’d like to thank Ralph, the management team and all of our employees for their dedication over the last two and a half years. During this time, UBS delivered record Our performance this quarter demonstrates that we continue to be a source of stability for our clients during periods of significant uncertainty. Our strong flows across Global Wealth Management and Asset Management reflect our clients’ continued confidence and trust in us. We are in advanced discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice, and I am pleased that we are making progress towards resolving this legacy matter that dates back 15 years. 16.5% and a cost-to-income ratio of 72.8%. When I left UBS in 2020, our strength and stability put us in a position to consider all options for our future, including transformative acquisitions. Today, UBS is stronger than ever, with diversified revenue streams, continued capital and liquidity strength, disciplined risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons. As a result, we are well prepared to be part of the solution to rescue Credit Suisse and contribute to financial stability in Switzerland and globally. Despite its complexity, I am convinced that this transaction will also provide value for the clients and employees of the combined organization. The acquisition enables us to benefit from the significant franchise value, and in many cases, complementary businesses within Credit Suisse. For our clients, the first quarter was largely a continuation of the themes from 2022. Clients continue to be concerned about the impact that inflation and central bank policy will have on economic growth, especially in the U.S. While our wealth management clients remained on the sidelines, our advisors helped them identify opportunities to manage their liquidity and diversify risks. As a result, we benefited from 20 billion dollars in net new fee-generating assets globally, an annualized growth rate of 6%. Net new money in GWM was 28 billion. Importantly, 7 billion of this came in the ten business days after the acquisition announcement. This is a further testament to how clients turn to us as they search for stability. During the first quarter, we helped our clients diversify cash holdings as they shifted deposits into money market funds and T-Bills. In Asset Management, we saw another 18 billion dollars in money market inflows, with strong contributions from our U.S. wealth management clients. We saw further deleveraging, particularly in the Americas, but also in APAC and EMEA. This was offset by loan growth in Switzerland, resulting in stable loan balances quarter-on-quarter, excluding FX. Compared to last year’s very strong first quarter, institutional clients were less active, particularly in equity derivatives and cash as they lacked conviction in an uncertain market. However, we did have strong performances in Prime Brokerage and electronic FX. Clients continue to turn to us for advice in managing their assets, including their liquidity. What is important is deposit shifts into money markets and T-bills remained with UBS and we also saw 9 billion in new deposits into our platform. This supported positive net new money across all of our regions in the first quarter. Let me go through each of the regions in more detail. In the Americas, our Separately Managed Account initiative with Asset Management further supported net new fee-generating assets. And during the period of significant disruption in March, we saw positive inflows from our clients. As a result, we had solid net new money for the quarter. Our advisor recruiting momentum also continued and should support flows in future periods, aligned with our continued growth ambitions in the U.S. The strength of our business in Switzerland resulted in another quarter of inflows into mandates and other investment products. In EMEA, clients continue to be cautious overall, but net new money was positive, and net interest income rose by nearly 60% as we started to benefit from higher Euro rates. Lastly, while our clients in Asia Pacific continued to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of transactions, we saw broad-based flows into net new fee-generating assets. We have now seen 17% net new fee-generating asset growth in APAC over the last twelve months. When I first became UBS’s Group CEO in 2011, we positioned our asset gathering and Swiss businesses at the heart of our strategy. We successfully restructured our Investment Bank by reducing non-core markets activities and assets with discipline. We solidified our capital position. And we took decisive actions to strengthen our culture. As a result of our efforts, we restored trust with all our stakeholders, materially de-risked our business and generated significant amounts of capital for our shareholders. As we now embark on another transformational step in UBS’s journey, our principles will remain the same. We will be laser-focused on delivering the best possible outcome for our unrivaled client franchises, our employees, our shareholders and for all of Switzerland. We will do this by maintaining our strong culture and focus on prudent risk management. The combination of UBS and Credit Suisse will result in around 5 trillion of invested assets, which is the equivalent for us of 7 to 10 years of net new money. It will make us the second largest wealth manager in the world. Importantly, it will reinforce our position as the only truly global player among the leading wealth managers with strategic scale and complementary capabilities in the most attractive growth markets. We will reinforce our leading position in APAC, Switzerland and EMEA and will significantly enhance our position in",['thank you sarah good morning everyone happy back you honor privilege lead ubs again especially pivotal time organization stakeholders first all i’d like thank ralph management team employees dedication last two half years time ubs delivered record performance quarter demonstrates continue source stability clients periods significant uncertainty strong flows across global wealth management asset management reflect clients’ continued confidence trust us advanced discussions us department justice pleased making progress towards resolving legacy matter dates back 15 years 165% cost-to-income ratio 728% left ubs 2020 strength stability put us position consider options future including transformative acquisitions today ubs stronger ever diversified revenue streams continued capital liquidity strength disciplined risk management balance sheet seasons result well prepared part solution rescue credit suisse contribute financial stability switzerland globally despite complexity convinced transaction also provide value clients employees combined organization acquisition enables us benefit significant franchise value many cases complementary businesses within credit suisse clients first quarter largely continuation themes 2022 clients continue concerned impact inflation central bank policy economic growth especially us wealth management clients remained sidelines advisors helped identify opportunities manage liquidity diversify risks result benefited 20 billion dollars net new fee-generating assets globally annualized growth rate 6% net new money gwm 28 billion importantly 7 billion came ten business days acquisition announcement testament clients turn us search stability first quarter helped clients diversify cash holdings shifted deposits money market funds t-bills asset management saw another 18 billion dollars money market inflows strong contributions us wealth management clients saw deleveraging particularly americas also apac emea offset loan growth switzerland resulting stable loan balances quarter-on-quarter excluding fx compared last year’s strong first quarter institutional clients less active particularly equity derivatives cash lacked conviction uncertain market however strong performances prime brokerage electronic fx clients continue turn us advice managing assets including liquidity important deposit shifts money markets t-bills remained ubs also saw 9 billion new deposits platform supported positive net new money across regions first quarter let go regions detail americas separately managed account initiative asset management supported net new fee-generating assets period significant disruption march saw positive inflows clients result solid net new money quarter advisor recruiting momentum also continued support flows future periods aligned continued growth ambitions us strength business switzerland resulted another quarter inflows mandates investment products emea clients continue cautious overall net new money positive net interest income rose nearly 60% started benefit higher euro rates lastly clients asia pacific continued take wait-and-see approach terms transactions saw broad-based flows net new fee-generating assets seen 17% net new fee-generating asset growth apac last twelve months first became ubs’s group ceo 2011 positioned asset gathering swiss businesses heart strategy successfully restructured investment bank reducing non-core markets activities assets discipline solidified capital position took decisive actions strengthen culture result efforts restored trust stakeholders materially de-risked business generated significant amounts capital shareholders embark another transformational step ubs’s journey principles remain same laser-focused delivering best possible outcome unrivaled client franchises employees shareholders switzerland maintaining strong culture focus prudent risk management combination ubs credit suisse result around 5 trillion invested assets equivalent us 7 10 years net new money make us second largest wealth manager world importantly reinforce position truly global player among leading wealth managers strategic scale complementary capabilities attractive growth markets reinforce leading position apac switzerland emea significantly enhance position']
1Q23,Latin America.,"In Asset Management, the combination will improve our positioning globally and in Europe. But more importantly, we will bring together two highly complementary businesses to increase our scale and accelerate our strategic growth plans. With the combination, our clients will benefit from an enhanced offering in Alternatives, Credit and Thematics, with additional scale for our Index platform. We are already the leading bank in Switzerland. This is not a result of our size or market share, but our expert capabilities and the global reach we provide our clients. The combination with Credit Suisse will reinforce these strengths. There is strong competition in the Swiss market. For example, the combined market share of UBS and Credit Suisse in mortgages and in loans to corporates and public institutions is lower than that of the cantonal banks. Raiffeisen has twice as many branches as UBS and Credit Suisse combined. So, customers have plenty of options and we will have to work hard to earn and retain their relationships. As we think about the future of this business, my commitment is that we will look at the best option to create most value for both franchises in the interest of our clients, employees, shareholders and society at large. This assessment will be based on facts, not emotions. Globally, we will stay true to our capital-light and client-focused investment bank model, which we will leverage across the organization while benefiting from diversification and complementary capabilities. As a result, the Investment Bank will account for around 25% of Group risk weighted assets on day-1 and beyond. Activities outside of our strategic focus and risk appetite will be run-down in the best interests of our shareholders while minimizing the risk of potential losses to the Swiss taxpayers. We are excited about the opportunity to deliver the combined strengths of both firms to an expanded client base. And initial conversations with our clients suggest they agree and recognize the value of the combined organization. There is much to do, and there will be difficult decisions to be made over the coming months. Transformations don’t happen in a straight line – we know that from our own experience. But we are confident in our ability to deliver on the end-state, as well as our existing growth ambition in the U.S. and APAC to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Before I hand over to Sarah, I’d like to provide a brief update on the status of the acquisition. We have received the required approvals from the Swiss authorities, including FINMA, as well as the UK’s PRA and the US Federal Reserve. Additional required approvals are being expedited, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. Since the deal is pending, we are limited in what we can communicate at this time, but we remain committed our high-level plan to provide you with more information on the transaction. One of my immediate priorities is our people across both organizations. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues at UBS. Until closing, we are restricted in the extent we can engage, and we are doing as much as we can given these restrictions. We have a lot of work ahead of us to bring our firms together and this transaction will present interesting and challenging opportunities to our current and future employees. We will be one team upon closing of the transaction, and we want the best people to take UBS forward. I am also focused on establishing our target operating model and organizational structure. It is clear that while we manage this integration, we need a model that will allow us to stay close to clients and, deliver on our ambitions and financial targets while also minimizing distractions. Over the coming weeks, I will provide you with more information on this. In summary, our strategy, capital strength, risk management and culture are what have put us in a position play an important role as we deliver on our integration plans. While the task ahead of us is challenging and urgent, we believe that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents a unique opportunity to generate significant, long-term value to all of our stakeholders. In particular, I am convinced that this transaction will help to reinforce the leading position of the Swiss financial center and will be of benefit to the entire economy. As we start writing our next chapter, I am looking forward to working with my executive team, and my colleagues across UBS and Credit Suisse, to build an organization that our clients, employees, shareholders and Switzerland can be proud of. With that, I hand over to Sarah.",['asset management combination improve positioning globally europe importantly bring together two highly complementary businesses increase scale accelerate strategic growth plans combination clients benefit enhanced offering alternatives credit thematics additional scale index platform already leading bank switzerland result size market share expert capabilities global reach provide clients combination credit suisse reinforce strengths strong competition swiss market example combined market share ubs credit suisse mortgages loans corporates public institutions lower cantonal banks raiffeisen twice many branches ubs credit suisse combined so customers plenty options work hard earn retain relationships think future business commitment look best option create value franchises interest clients employees shareholders society large assessment based facts emotions globally stay true capital-light client-focused investment bank model leverage across organization benefiting diversification complementary capabilities result investment bank account around 25% group risk weighted assets day-1 beyond activities outside strategic focus risk appetite run-down best interests shareholders minimizing risk potential losses swiss taxpayers excited opportunity deliver combined strengths firms expanded client base initial conversations clients suggest agree recognize value combined organization much do difficult decisions made coming months transformations don’t happen straight line – know experience confident ability deliver end-state well existing growth ambition us apac create long-term value stakeholders hand sarah i’d like provide brief update status acquisition received required approvals swiss authorities including finma well uk’s pra us federal reserve additional required approvals expedited continue expect transaction close second quarter since deal pending limited communicate time remain committed high-level plan provide information transaction one immediate priorities people across organizations look forward welcoming new colleagues ubs closing restricted extent engage much given restrictions lot work ahead us bring firms together transaction present interesting challenging opportunities current future employees one team upon closing transaction want best people take ubs forward also focused establishing target operating model organizational structure clear manage integration need model allow us stay close clients and deliver ambitions financial targets also minimizing distractions coming weeks provide information this summary strategy capital strength risk management culture put us position play important role deliver integration plans task ahead us challenging urgent believe acquisition credit suisse presents unique opportunity generate significant long-term value stakeholders particular convinced transaction help reinforce leading position swiss financial center benefit entire economy start writing next chapter looking forward working executive team colleagues across ubs credit suisse build organization clients employees shareholders switzerland proud of that hand sarah']
1Q23,Sarah Youngwood,"Thank you, Sergio. Good morning, everyone. related to the advanced discussions with the DOJ regarding our legacy RMBS litigation matter. against an uncertain market backdrop. Underlying profit before tax was 2.4 billion dollars, with a return on CET1 of 16.5% and a cost/income ratio of 72.8%, in line with our Group targets. You will find the delta between reported and underlying performance in the appendix. Underlying revenue was down 8% and expense was down 2%. FX impacted revenue and expense for a positive net impact of 15 [edit: 14 million]. The net credit loss expense was 38 million dollars, compared with 18 million last year – all low levels, reflecting the high quality of our loan book. With 94% collateralization, our portfolio remains very resilient in the current environment. GWM and P&C more than offset by lower asset-based and transaction fees, as well as lower IB revenue. What is driving this picture is a macroeconomic environment characterized by a decrease in equity markets as well as lower levels of client, M&A and capital market activity versus last year. However, we continued to see the benefit of higher rates and solid activity in fixed income. Moving to NII on page 10 – In the first quarter, NII of 2.2 billion dollars was up 520 million, or 31% year-on- year. Quarter-on-quarter, NII was up 3%, in line with overall guidance. This reflects the benefits of our global diversification, as increases in Swiss Franc and Euro more than offset reductions in US Dollar NII. Moving to the chart, in the second column, the increase was driven by the benefit of rates. This was largely offset by changes in deposit mix. Our experience this quarter is in line with the trends we have seen over the last year. Our clients have continued to shift some of their balances from sweeps into higher-yielding products. We will come back to money market funds and treasury bonds, but within deposits, clients have moved into our attractive saving accounts and CDs. Moving to deposit volumes – Total deposits decreased 3% sequentially. However, it is important to note that these funds have not left our platform. At the start of the year, often based on our investment advice, we have seen clients repositioning from deposits into Money Market funds and Treasuries within our platform. In fact, we retained these balances, and on top of that, in GWM, we had 9 billion dollars of net new deposits into UBS mostly driven by the U.S. after March 10. Looking ahead, based on the current forwards – For 2Q23, we anticipate a mid-single digit decrease versus 1Q23, as slight increases in P&C are expected to be offset by reductions in GWM. We also expect the full year to be broadly in line with 4Q annualized. Now, turning to costs on page 11 – We had reported operating expense of 7.2 billion. This included the litigation provision mentioned earlier and 70 million acquisition costs. Excluding these and FX, this quarter’s operating expense was down 1%, as reductions in variable comp more than offset inflationary pressures on salaries, investments in technology, T&E and redundancy costs. On redundancy costs, we saw 68 million of expense related to initiatives across GWM, IB and AM this quarter. We expect the benefit of these actions to materialize in the following quarters. For 2023, on a standalone basis, we still expect costs ex-litigation and FX to increase by net 2 to 3% year-on- year and we are on track to deliver on our gross cost saving program of 1.1 billion. Let’s move to our businesses – starting with GWM on page 12. GWM profit before tax in the quarter was 1.2 billion dollars. Revenue was 2% lower than last year, with asset-based and transaction revenue down in all regions, partially offset by net interest income. We continue to actively manage deposits across margins, volumes and mix, driving NII up 31% year-on-year. NII was down 1% sequentially. Operating expense ex-litigation and FX was flat year-on-year. We delivered net new money of 28 billion dollars, with net inflows in all regions. Net new fee-generating assets were 20 billion dollars in the quarter, an annualized growth rate of 6%, mostly into advisory mandates and SMAs. Moving to Asset Management, on page 13 – with a profit before tax of 94 million dollars. Total revenue decreased 13%, with lower net management fees, driven by market headwinds, asset mix and FX, as well as lower performance fees net of the pass-through referred to on this page. The cost/income ratio was 81%, with lower revenue, and operating expense up 1%. The team has taken action to address this negative operating leverage, the benefits of which you will see in the coming quarters. Net new money in the quarter was 14 billion dollars, delivering a strong net new money annualized growth rate of over 5%. This includes 18 billion dollars into money markets, as we successfully captured client demand for cash-like solutions. attributed equity. Revenue in Global Markets of 2.0 billion dollars was down 15% ex-FX, against a record first quarter last year. In Equities, activity levels decreased in all regions, particularly in equity derivatives and cash equities. Despite this, we delivered the best quarter on record in our Prime Brokerage and a very strong performance in eFX. With very different market conditions versus the beginning of last year, we were up 1% in FRC with credit more than offsetting FX and Rates. Global Banking revenue was down 30%, as the positive momentum at the start of the year was interrupted by the sudden uptick in uncertainty in financials in March, affecting client sentiment. Against this backdrop, we outperformed the global fee pool, with particular strength in APAC and EMEA. Within M&A, we saw market outperformance across all regions. Operating expense was down 5% ex-litigation and FX, primarily driven by lower variable compensation, and with cost savings initiatives largely offsetting inflationary pressures on salaries. Wrapping up on the businesses with the excellent performance in P&C on page 15 – Profit before tax in the first quarter was 553 million Swiss francs, the best quarter in almost 15 years, when excluding one-off gains. This result was largely driven by 32% higher NII. Overall, total revenue rose 18% year-on-year, including record transaction-based income and stable recurring fees. We consistently engaged with our clients and were able to deliver 860 million of net new investment products, an annualized growth rate of 16%. We also saw 1.7 billion of net new loans while net new deposits were negative 1.8 billion, as positive flows in Personal Banking were more than offset by outflows in Corporate and Institutional Clients, mainly driven by investment activities. We delivered a cost/income ratio of 52%, a 7 percentage point improvement year-over-year. This reflects 5% higher costs, largely reflecting technology investments. This consistent focus on our digital transformation continues to pay off. We saw an 11 percentage point increase year-on-year in the share of Personal Banking clients that are active mobile users – which benefits our clients and creates operational efficiencies. have a strong capital and liquidity position, risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons. As we continue to prudently manage our resources, we maintained healthy liquidity buffers with an LCR of 162% and an NSFR of 118%, broadly stable QoQ. We maintained 144 billion cash balances, which is 29% of deposits and more than half of our HQLA. In total, 90% of our HQLA qualifies as level one, which is the highest quality of liquid assets. In line with our liquidity management principles, we continue to target a diversified funding mix, across regions and products, including deposit types. UBS has not tapped into any of the SNB facilities and we expect to continue not to do so. Moving to capital on page 17 – At 13.9%, we continued to have a strong capital position, comfortably above our 13% guidance and 10.4% regulatory requirement. On the walk – starting at 14.2% at the end of last quarter. Net profit contributed 30 basis points, offset by capital returns to our shareholders at around 50 basis points. The net currency effect was close to nil quarter- on-quarter, as the FX impact on CET1 and RWA offset each other. In the first quarter, we have repurchased 1.3 billion dollars of shares. While we remain committed to our capital return policy, including progressive dividends and buybacks, we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in light of the planned acquisition of Credit Suisse, and we intend to resume them as soon as possible. few items. The first column refers to the registration statement with the SEC, which is a requirement for the close. It will include pro forma financials as of December 31st 2022.

After that, we plan to update you regularly. turn to us for advice and stability in uncertain times.

1Q24,Group Chief Financial Officer,Including analyst Q&A session,['including analyst q&a session']
1Q24,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. A little over a year ago, we were asked to play a critical role in stabilizing the Swiss and global financial systems through the acquisition of Credit Suisse and we are delivering on our commitments. This quarter marks the return to reported net profits and capital accretion – a testament to the strength of our client franchises and significant progress on our integration plans. Reported net profit was 1.8 billion, with underlying PBT of 2.6 billion and an underlying return on CET1 capital of 9.6%. Our commitment to stay close to clients supported healthy revenue growth in our core businesses and flows across our asset gathering franchises. Meanwhile, we are executing on our restructuring plans at pace and actively winding down Non-core and Legacy assets. We also achieved another 1 billion in annualized run-rate gross cost savings during the quarter as we progress towards our 13 billion target. As for the next significant integration milestones, we remain on track with our plans to simplify our legal entity structure. The merger of our parent banks is expected by the end of May and the transition to a single U.S. intermediate holding company is expected to occur shortly thereafter. The merger of our Swiss bank entities is set to take place before the end of the third quarter. All of this is subject to final regulatory approvals. These critical milestones will facilitate the migration of clients onto UBS platforms beginning later this year and unlock the next phase of the cost, capital, funding and tax benefits from the second half of 2024, and more so by the end of 2025 and into 2026. Lastly, improvements in our CET1 capital ratio was supported by our optimization of risk weighted assets. As a consequence, we remain well positioned to deliver on our capital return targets this year. Our underlying financial performance was driven by significant positive operating leverage at the Group level with 15% revenue growth alongside a 5% reduction in operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to a year ago, we reduced operating expenses by around 12%. We had excellent performance in Global Wealth Management as underlying PBT doubled sequentially to 1.3 billion. Personal & Corporate Banking delivered underlying profit growth quarter on quarter driven by higher discipline. As a result of the restructuring efforts we have undertaken over the last nine months, I am particularly pleased that Credit Suisse’s Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management franchises are now all profitable and contributed to our financial performance. The Investment Bank delivered a double-digit underlying return on attributed equity supported by lower operating expenses compared to Q4, and another strong quarter in Global Banking revenues. Lastly, we had a positive revenue contribution from Non-core and Legacy as we accelerated position exits while further reducing costs. While we continue to deliver on the integration, helping our clients manage, grow and protect their assets remains our top priority. We maintained our momentum with clients in GWM. Invested assets have now surpassed 4 trillion as we generated 27 billion of net new assets. Though geopolitical volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty continued to weigh on client sentiment, we observed an improvement in risk appetite and activity. We also saw an improvement in client activity within P&C, particularly among corporates. In Asset Management, our clients continue to value our Separately Managed Account and Sustainability offerings. We generated 21 billion in net new money during the quarter. In Global Banking, we outperformed the fee pools in all regions, but most notably in the U.S. where the integration of Credit Suisse teams is progressing well and our pipeline continues to build. Let’s move to Non-core and Legacy. our operations as we run down the portfolio. We accelerated the wind-down of several complex and longer-dated positions this quarter, supporting a capital release of around 2 billion and a material improvement in our natural run-off profile. We are well positioned to achieve our target to reduce NCL risk weighted assets to around 5% of the Group by the end of 2026 and we remain focused on accelerating position exits in a manner that continues to optimize value. Turning to capital. As you can see, the combination of our highly capital generative business and the restructuring and active management of financial resources has further reinforced our balance sheet for all seasons. This permits us to follow through on our capital return plans for 2024. During the quarter, we began accruing for a mid-teen percentage year-on-year increase in our dividend. And, as previously communicated, we expect to resume share repurchases following the completion of the parent bank merger, targeting up to 1 billion. Our ambition is to continue repurchases in 2025 and for our capital returns in 2026 to exceed pre-acquisition levels. Of course, all of this is now subject to our assessment of any proposed requirements related to Switzerland’s ongoing review of its regulatory regime. In this respect, I’d like to address the recent proposals in Switzerland to strengthen the too-big-to-fail regime. It is clear both to us and several expert groups that too-low capital requirements were not why Credit Suisse needed rescuing. However, we agree with the Swiss Federal Council’s view that capital and liquidity requirements on their own are not sufficient to ensure the resilience and stability of a systemically important bank. In addition to having a strong capital position, it is key to maintain a sustainable business model centered around risk-adjusted profitability and a robust risk management framework. All of these are core principles for UBS. For over ten years, this approach has served our clients, employees, investors and the Swiss economy well. It is what allowed UBS to respond to the Swiss government’s request in March 2023 to be part of the solutions to stabilize the financial system. While some modifications to the regulatory regime may be necessary - and we have endorsed many - the discussion around capital should be based on facts. That includes a full and transparent account of what led to the idiosyncratic failures of Credit Suisse. The ultimate and crucial objective of the too-big-to-fail regime must be to credibly demonstrate that a systemically important bank could be saved in a crisis largely through its own financial resources. We believe UBS has and will continue to demonstrate its resolvability from both an operational and capital point of view. With around 200 billion in total loss absorbing capacity, our shareholders and structurally subordinated bondholders bear the significant costs and risks to ensure taxpayers would not suffer in the highly unlikely scenario that a major systemic event affects UBS. We appreciate that many of you would like a quantification of the potential impact of any new capital regime, but it is too soon to jump to conclusions. It would be inappropriate for us to speculate or respond to speculation on the potential impact. We were not involved in the consultation process leading to the publication of the Federal Council’s report, and do not have clarity on any proposed changes and how they would be implemented. Nonetheless, one point on which we may offer some clarification is the topic of parent bank capital. Our parent bank was already well capitalized in both absolute and relative terms and is in a position today to absorb the removal of substantial regulatory concessions granted to Credit Suisse. By fully aligning the treatment of capital at Credit Suisse to our more rigorous approach, UBS has to provide the additional capital required for the phase-in of risk-weighted assets for Credit Suisse participations. UBS had already done this for its subsidiaries when the rules were introduced in 2017. Further, UBS will not rely upon the regulatory filter historically applied to Credit Suisse. Overall, this requires additional capital in the amount of about 9 billion dollars. When applied consistently and coherently, the Basel 3 rules that UBS and its global peers must follow are robust. They too, are being significantly tightened. In addition, the phasing-in of progressive capital add-ons will already lead to substantially higher capital requirements for UBS’s parent bank, about another 10 billion. So overall, we are adding almost 20 billion in additional capital which, of course, was already reflected in our previously communicated capital and financial targets. In our view, all of this must be considered when new requirements are discussed, defined and calibrated. In this respect, we will be constructively contributing our views to the relevant authorities and various policymakers. As the third-largest private employer, one of the country’s largest taxpayers and as importantly, a significant provider of credit to households and businesses in Switzerland, we believe it is also our responsibility to share our perspectives with the wider public. This is an important discussion for the country and I remain hopeful for a proportionate outcome. In the meantime, in addition to executing on our integration plans, we will remain focused on what we are able to control – serving our clients, following through on our strategy, investing in our people and remaining a pillar of economic support in the communities where we live and work.

1Q24,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you Sergio, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I would offer a reminder that the first quarter financial report published today includes select inter-divisional changes we signaled last year. We shifted the Swiss high-net worth segment from P&C to GWM, and pushed-out residual, centrally-held costs and financial resources to our business divisions, ultimately increasing the equity we allocate to them. These divisional shifts support continued resource discipline and accountability. They also align with interests of shareholders by reflecting Group performance as a whole through the reporting lens of the respective individual businesses. In my remarks today, I will refer to underlying numbers in US dollars and compare them to our performance last quarter, unless stated otherwise. as excellent progress across our integration workstreams, resulting in substantial reductions in operating expenses and risk-weighted assets. Profit before tax increased significantly to 2.6 billion from strong operating leverage quarter-on-quarter driven by higher revenues and lower costs, both of which I will cover in more detail shortly. Net credit loss expenses declined by 30 million this quarter to 106 million. On a reported basis, the first quarter net profit was 1.8 billion, including a tax expense of 0.6 billion. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, lower than previously guided, primarily due to the strong performance in Non-core and Legacy that reduced the level of losses in select Credit Suisse legal entities. We expect the effective tax rate in the second quarter to return to more elevated levels from higher forecasted losses in these entities before the first of the planned mergers takes place later this month. We then expect the Group’s effective tax rate in the second half of 2024 to continue to normalize, ultimately falling to its structural level of 23% by 2026, driven by further legal entity optimization and cost elimination. Management, the Investment Bank and Non-core and Legacy. The latter included a gain from the close-out of the main aspects of the transaction relating to the former Credit Suisse Securitized Products business, which was announced earlier in the quarter. Partially offsetting our top line performance was a decline of 446 million in Group Items, driven primarily from hedging P&L reflecting higher interest rates and widening currency basis spreads in the quarter. Total reported revenues reached 12.7 billion, which included 0.8 billion from purchase price allocation adjustments in our core businesses. Since the Credit Suisse acquisition, these adjustments total 3.1 billion, excluding the effects in NCL, and mainly relate to loans that will pull-to-par if held to maturity. We continue to expect to report additional revenues of around 7.4 billion through the end of 2028 from these acquisition- related effects, of which 0.6 billion is expected in the second quarter. the largest reductions in Non-core and Legacy, Global Wealth Management, and the Investment Bank. Personnel costs excluding variable and Financial Advisor compensation decreased by around 120 million, or 3% quarter-on-quarter. Variable and FA compensation expenses were up 11% sequentially on the back of higher revenues. Overall, personnel expenses increased by 2%. There were almost 2 thousand fewer total staff at the end of the first quarter when compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and over 19 thousand fewer versus the end of 2022, down 12.5% over the past 5 quarters. Non-personnel expenses were down 0.6 billion quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower real estate expenses combined with a reduction in third party spend. Additionally, the fourth quarter contained charges for the UK bank levy and the US FDIC special assessment that were not present in our first quarter performance. Integration-related expenses in the first quarter were 1 billion, split roughly half-half between personnel and non-personnel costs, resulting in reported operating expenses of 10.3 billion. February. Exiting the first quarter, we realized an additional 1 billion in gross cost saves when compared to the 2023 exit rate. Since the end of 2022, we have achieved 5 billion in gross saves, or nearly 40% of our 2026 exit-rate ambition of 13 billion. As I highlighted in February, we expect our integration work to intensify over the next several, pivotal quarters. This will require appropriate staff levels to ensure efficient, effective and well-controlled execution. Accordingly, the pace of gross cost saves is likely to decelerate from the run rate savings output achieved over the last 5 quarters, with another 1.5 billion in gross cost saves expected by the end of the year. Following this intensive phase, we continue to expect the pace of gross saves to pick up again in 2025. Integration-related expenses linked to our cost-saving actions reached a total of 5.5 billion since the Credit Suisse acquisition, including the 1 billion incurred in the first quarter. As previously mentioned, we expect to incur around 13 billion of integration-related expenses by the end of 2026, or a ratio of about 1-to-1 between costs-to-achieve and gross saves. As these integration charges enable and unlock future cost reductions, we expect them to outpace gross saves through the rest of 2024, totaling 3.5 billion, of which we estimate 1.3 billion in the second quarter. Of course, what matters is turning gross saves into clear progress in our underlying opex performance. Our 1Q24 underlying operating expenses of 9.2 billion signal a significant improvement against our 2022 benchmark, meaning a majority of the gross cost saves we’ve realized to date have translated into net reductions in our underlying opex. Thus far, most of these life-to-date net saves benefit Non-core and Legacy. I highlighted in February that we expect around half of the Group’s planned gross cost saves, and a considerable majority of net saves, to be achieved from running down NCL’s book as well as eliminating expenses associated with maintaining Credit Suisse’s many legal entities and branches. We are seeing this dynamic reflected in our cost performance. We also expect NCL to benefit further from the upcoming legal entity mergers and from continued position exits, working towards a 2026 opex exit rate of less than 1 billion. Finally, in our core businesses, we expect to realize a significant portion of integration cost synergies beginning in 2025 when client accounts and positions are moved to UBS platforms and applications, and Credit Suisse infrastructure is shut down. Moving on to the quarterly performance of our business divisions and starting with Global Wealth Management operating expenses. Notably, on a combined basis, PBT increased by around 20% year-over-year, with the Credit Suisse platform returning firmly to profitability. Overall, we see very good client momentum across GWM, with net new assets of 27 billion and strong contributions from the Americas, Switzerland, and APAC. Net new fee generating assets reached almost 18 billion from healthy net inflows to SMAs in the US and discretionary mandates in EMEA and Switzerland. The business achieved this flow performance while focusing on financial resource efficiency and balance sheet management, seeking to reprice loans with sub-hurdle returns or to otherwise exit such positions. This ongoing work mitigates some of the headwinds from inherited Credit Suisse risk models and led to a decline in credit and counterparty risk RWAs of 4 billion in the quarter. We’ve also begun to see progress in GWM’s revenue- over-RWA metric, particularly on the Credit Suisse platform. GWM also attracted 8 billion in net new deposits in the quarter while our pricing increasingly reflects the Group’s strong liquidity profile and tighter funding spreads. I would note that we estimate seasonal tax-related outflows in our US business in the mid-to-high single-digit billions as a headwind to divisional net new asset performance in the second quarter. Now, onto GWM’s financials. Revenues increased by 10% sequentially with improvements across all lines, driven by higher client activity and increased average-asset levels. Revenue performance related to client transactional activity was particularly strong across the business. NII increased by 4% sequentially to 1.6 billion, as higher revenues from re-investments as well as increased US dollar deposit rates and volumes offset the effects of tapering deposit mix shifts and client deleveraging. In the second quarter, we expect a low-to-mid, single-digit percentage decline in GWM NII due to moderately lower lending and deposit volumes, and lower interest rates in Switzerland, partly offset by additional revenues, primarily from higher US dollar rates combined with our repricing efforts. For the full year 2024, we expect NII in GWM to be roughly flat versus 4Q23 annualized. Specifically, we see NII and margins holding broadly steady in 2H24, and after the second quarter broadly reverses out the sequential gains we realized this quarter. This outcome, which models three US dollar rate cuts, is helped by lower funding costs as well as our balance sheet initiatives. Recurring net fee income increased by 4% to 3 billion in the quarter from higher client balances and inflows in net new fee-generating assets. This was partly offset by margin compression from more of the back book reflecting greater penetration into lower margin mandates across higher wealth bands. Transaction-based income increased by a third sequentially to 1.2 billion, driven by higher trading volumes, particularly in structured products, partly due to the seasonal increase in client activity levels, with significant improvements across all regions. Combined transaction revenues were also 9% higher year-over-year. Our APAC franchise had a particularly impressive transaction revenue quarter, doubling from 4Q with strength demonstrated across all product classes, despite the economic uncertainties weighing on sentiment for most of the first quarter. We also saw positive momentum in the Americas, where the introduction of our international model of joint coverage of GWM clients with the IB, led to transaction-based revenue gains of 11% quarter-on-quarter and a mid-teens increase year-on-year. Expenses for the quarter were down 3% sequentially, mainly from decreases in salaries and non-personnel costs, and with non-recurring items in the fourth quarter falling away, outweighing increases this quarter in variable and Financial Advisor compensation. now more closely aligned to strengthen client engagement, P&C increased pre-tax profit by 11% sequentially to 774 million Swiss francs, its highest PBT since before the Credit Suisse acquisition. Revenues were up by 4% with gains across each significant revenue line, further supported by a 47% decline in credit loss expense quarter-on-quarter. Deposit balances in Swiss franc terms remained roughly stable, with inflows in personal banking largely offset by outflows in corporate balances with lower liquidity value. This was a strong outcome considering the current rates environment in Switzerland and the ongoing work in the business to gain share of wallet and to improve balance sheet efficiency, supporting our net interest margin in 1Q. NII increased by 3% sequentially to 1.1 billion, principally as higher re-investment income more than offset declines in revenue from lower lending volumes and ongoing deposit mix shifts. In the second quarter, we expect a mid-to-high single-digit percentage decrease in P&C’s NII in US dollars, more than offsetting the first quarter’s sequential gains, especially as the effects of the Swiss central bank’s March interest rate cut hit through for a full quarter. For the full year 2024, we likewise expect a mid-to-high single-digit percentage decline in P&C’s NII versus 4Q23 annualized. We see NII holding broadly steady in US dollar terms in 2H24, as P&C’s balance sheet management efforts to improve loan margins help to mitigate lower loan and deposit volumes, as well as the modeled effects of two further 25 basis-point rate cuts in Switzerland. The outlook also includes a 50 million annualized headwind from the effects of higher minimum reserve requirements at the Swiss central bank. Transaction-based revenues were up 9% in the quarter principally on strong corporate client engagement. Recurring net fee income gained 5% sequentially on higher client asset balances supported by net new inflows in the quarter. Credit loss expense was 39 million as PPA adjustments offset a similar level of charges on impaired loans acquired from Credit Suisse. Operating expenses were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, principally due to higher staff costs in Switzerland and a lease accounting credit recorded in the comparable quarter.. million, as lower revenues were only partially offset by reduced operating expenses. While net management fees were steady quarter-on quarter, the sequential drop in the top line is explained by fourth quarter revenues, which included the gain from the sale of an investment stake, as well as seasonally higher performance fees. Net new money in the quarter was 21 billion due to several big-ticket inflows in mainly passive equity and fixed income funds, including money markets. We also continue to see client demand for SMA, sustainable investments and our Private Markets capabilities. Opex decreased by 7% to 594 million, mainly from lower personnel, technology and litigation costs. As I highlighted during the investor update in February, we aim to improve operating leverage in Asset Management by focusing on cost optimization across the entire division and realizing synergies from migration of clients onto UBS infrastructure over the course of 2025. combined IB with standalone UBS performance on a year-on-year basis. Operating profit was 404 million, marking the IB’s first profitable quarter since the acquisition, and broad completion of the restructuring of the parts of Credit Suisse’s IB that are core to our own. Return on attributed equity also turned positive and reached 10% for the quarter. Underlying revenues increased by 4% to 2.5 billion. Underscoring our efforts to increase the IB’s market share in the US, the IB’s top line increased by 29% in the region. Banking maintained its strong momentum with overall revenues up by 52%. Notably, we also increased market share in the US, where Banking now contributes a third of total IB revenues, up from less than 20% a year ago. We continue to be pleased with our performance in Capital Markets, up 85% year-over-year, as LCM, DCM and ECM all saw increased activity levels, building on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter. Advisory revenues increased by 11% as we continue to outperform the global fee pool. The recovery in M&A is continuing, particularly in the US, albeit with more subdued client sentiment and activity in APAC, where we have a large share of the market. With our Banking coverage teams now fully integrated, our pipeline offers encouraging revenue potential in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Revenues in Markets declined 5% to 1.9 billion, but were up 6% year-over-year in the Americas. Equities revenues, driven by Cash Equities, were up 3%. FRC, where we remain underweight by design, was down 21% with both Rates and FX affected by lower volatility and decreased client activity. Operating expenses rose 8%, predominantly from additional costs related to personnel onboarded from Credit Suisse’s investment bank, but, importantly, dropped 4% sequentially, while revenues were up 32% quarter- on-quarter. in revenues principally from gains on position exits. In addition to the securitized products transaction I mentioned earlier, the business recognized proceeds from the close-out of several complex and longer-dated positions above their book carrying amounts, including in its conduit and corporate loan books and within its longevity portfolio. Despite the strong revenue performance in the first quarter, we continue to expect the NCL book to ultimately close out across its various positions at more or less their current carrying values, meaning it is still appropriate to assume revenues of nil going forward, net of hedging and funding costs. It is also important to reiterate that, in pursuit of our priorities in NCL, we may at times sacrifice P&L on position exits to eliminate costs and release sub-optimally deployed capital. Nevertheless, given the strong revenue performance in 1Q along with the significant progress we’ve made on costs, we now expect NCL’s full-year 2024 underlying PBT to be a loss of around 2.5 billion versus the expected 4 billion loss we signaled in February. As Sergio highlighted, we made substantial progress in reducing the NCL portfolio in the quarter, decreasing RWAs by 16 billion, principally in credit and market risk. In just nine months, we’ve run down 28 billion, or almost a third, of NCL’s risk weighted assets. From an LRD perspective, the overall portfolio is down by roughly half from 2Q23, after a further reduction of 49 billion in the first quarter. As I covered earlier, a significant portion of the Group’s overall opex decline this quarter was delivered by NCL, which saw a 26% sequential drop in underlying costs to 769 million, primarily due to lower third party, real estate, and technology costs. generated in 1Q offsetting our dividend accruals and 1.3 billion in negative currency translation effects. As we’ve highlighted, we made significant progress this quarter in reducing financial resource consumption across the bank from both the active run-down of NCL as well as balance sheet management initiatives across the core businesses. This resulted in a 4% sequential decline in RWA and a 6% reduction in LRD. Credit and counterparty risk RWAs dropped by 11 billion from position sales and roll-offs, as well as from risk model mitigation, with currency effects contributing another 11 billion to the quarter-on-quarter decline. Market risk RWAs increased by 3 billion as asset-size decreases were more than offset by the effects of model updates from the integration of time decay into our VaR calculations. over the course of 1Q. As previously highlighted, a surplus above our CET1 capital ratio target of around 14% is necessary to cater for expected volatility in our reported profitability as we execute on the various phases of the integration. Our LCR at quarter end was 220%, reflecting ample levels of liquidity to remain compliant with the new Swiss liquidity ordinance that went live at the start of the year. We remain focused on raising stable deposits with tenors, products and counterparty selection resulting in higher liquidity value. And, we continue to apply discipline on pricing. Strong investor demand for our name in capital markets and improving conditions allowed us to complete nearly half of our full-year funding plan during the first quarter. We successfully placed over 5 billion in attractively-priced HoldCo in January, and 1.5 billion in AT1 across two transactions in February at spreads that were around 100 basis points inside our heavily subscribed November placement. Similarly, secondary market spreads continued to tighten post-acquisition, having now dropped to February 2023 levels, and together with ongoing diversification of our funding sources, are supporting our plan to lower funding costs by around 1 billion by 2026. As part of the broadening out of our funding sources, we structured two first-of-their-kind transactions for UBS, including an issue of 1 billion in euro-denominated covered bonds, and a private placement for size via repo of a portion of our portfolio of Swiss franc-denominated covered bonds. I would highlight that these trades were priced below the spread on the outstanding ELA line with the Swiss central bank. As to ELA, we have now repaid 29 billion of this line extended to Credit Suisse pre-acquisition, including 9 billion Swiss francs just yesterday. We expect to repay the remaining 9 billion in the coming months. Overall, our balance sheet management initiatives, together with actions on the funding side that I just described, improved our loan to deposit ratio this quarter and narrowed the funding gap we inherited from Credit Suisse. Importantly, our efforts are helping us to offset NII headwinds, and are contributing to the strength of our overall liquidity and funding profile. With that, let’s open for questions.",['thank sergio good morning everyone begin would offer reminder first quarter financial report published today includes select inter-divisional changes signaled

2Q23,Group Chief Financial Officer,Including analyst Q&A session,['including analyst q&a session']
2Q23,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you Sarah, and good morning everyone. I hope you had a relaxing summer break. For us, these past eight weeks were intense as we were busy writing the next chapter in UBS’s history. This is the first-ever acquisition involving two global systemically important banks. It was announced only five months ago and we closed it less than 100 days ago. This would not have been possible without extraordinary effort and dedication from my colleagues across both organizations. It also required extensive cooperation from the Swiss government and regulators in Switzerland and around the world. We are swiftly executing on our integration plans, already achieving a number of important milestones. We established a target operating model, created a dedicated integration office, and rolled out responsibilities with management appointments up to three levels below the Group Executive Board, just to name a few. We are also making progress on our cost-saving and de-risking plans and resolving some legacy matters for both firms. Following a detailed analysis, we terminated and handed back all Swiss government support a few weeks ago. Lastly, we decided to fully integrate the Swiss business of Credit Suisse after a thorough strategic review. The thing I am proudest about is that clients have rewarded our unwavering commitment with extended trust. Thanks to their restored belief in the combined firm we were able to swiftly stabilize the Credit Suisse core – its wealth, asset management, and Swiss Bank franchises. We are happy to see markets recognizing our ongoing work. Our strategy is unchanged, and the Credit Suisse acquisition will act as an accelerant to our plans. We will strengthen our position as the only truly global wealth manager, and as the leading Swiss universal bank, with scaled-up asset management and a focused investment bank. With a highly complementary footprint, we will reinforce our position in key growth markets, including the Americas and APAC, and build on our leadership in Switzerland and EMEA. We will relentlessly focus on clients and continuously improve and expand our services and products. With 5.5 trillion dollars in assets across the combined firm, the transaction adds scale that will lead to increased efficiencies. This will allow us to better focus our resources, and target investments that provide superior levels of client service. We will achieve our strategy while remaining disciplined in our resource management across the entire firm. The IB consuming no more than 25% of the Group’s risk-weighted assets and the rundown of the Non-core and Legacy portfolio are just two of the more visible examples of our approach. In essence, we will repeat what this bank successfully accomplished during the last decade. Before I discuss the Swiss Bank decision, let me give you a brief overview of our assessment of Credit Suisse as of March 19. Since then, and especially after we closed the acquisition in June, we conducted an in-depth analysis that has only confirmed the necessity of the decisive actions taken over that weekend. It was not just a matter of liquidity drying up. Credit Suisse’s business model and business mix was deeply flawed and its reputation severely damaged. With its structural lack of underlying profitability, unsustainable capital allocation, and negative revenue and costs prospects, the bank was no longer in a position to continue on its own. This is clearly visible from the year-to-date losses Credit Suisse reported today, a culmination of the bank’s two loss-making years. Thanks to our financial and balance sheet strength, UBS was in a position to answer a rescue call from the Swiss government, helping to stabilize the financial system. Importantly, the transaction preserves the best of Credit Suisse’s excellent client relationships, people, and industry-leading products that in other plausible scenarios would have been weakened or lost. Unlocking Credit Suisse’s strengths as part of UBS, will allow us to build something of a more enduring value for all stakeholders. This combination will reinforce our status as a premier global franchise – one that our home market, Switzerland, can be proud of. We are humbled by this task, and the responsibility entrusted to us. But let me make one thing absolutely clear: Our ability to stabilize Credit Suisse, and return the government guarantees in timely fashion, should not take away from the gravity of the situation we inherited. Nor should it diminish the scope and scale of the task ahead. That being said, let me walk you through how we came to our decision on the future of Credit Suisse (Schweiz). As I promised when I returned as CEO a few months ago, the decision would be driven by facts, not emotions, and mindful of the extraordinary circumstances of the transaction. We conducted an extremely thorough review involving teams comprised of some of the best people across both firms, with support from external experts where needed. Our analysis focused on four key aspects that, for us, would determine the long-term viability of the business. We examined what the decision would entail for our clients, shareholders, and employees. And we gave special consideration to financial and funding sustainability. We started with a broad spectrum of possibilities, ranging from IPO, sale, partial or full integration to a spinoff, and even a dual-brand strategy. Eventually, based on our criteria, we narrowed down our selection to the two best options: a full integration or a spin-off of a focused perimeter, which would exclude segments requiring global capabilities. The final outcome was crystal clear: Full integration is by far the best choice. It is not just that the financial merits of integration are greater. It is also the best way forward for our clients, for whom the industry-leading offering will improve and broaden as we combine products and capabilities from both firms. The alternative would have been a bleak one, considering the current situation, combined with the necessity to carve out most of its global capabilities. Even a more focused spin-off of Credit Suisse Schweiz would fail to meet the needs of many of its corporate clients, as well as the entrepreneurs it considers core. At the same time, separation from the Group would entail a costly, risky and lengthy carveout of technology platforms, causing uncertainty for clients and employees for years to come. Moreover, our analysis revealed a substantial dependency of the Swiss subsidiary on financial resources and operational support from the parent. As a result, it would have existed as a fragile entity struggling to close its funding gap, unable to compete effectively and failing to deliver sustainable returns. We believe this would not have been an acceptable proposition for clients, employees – and very likely - regulators. By contrast, being a part of UBS ensures it will have continuous backing from one of the most stable and trusted global financial institutions. The strength of UBS will underpin the franchise and provide access to efficient funding, as demonstrated by our ability to return all extraordinary government and central bank facilities. We take our social responsibilities very seriously. This is why I have repeatedly emphasized the fact that employment-related considerations must be a key decision-making factor in our evaluation. We have analyzed their impact in both absolute terms and in relation to the Swiss job market. Every lost job is painful for us. Unfortunately, in this situation, cuts were unavoidable, regardless of the selected scenario. We are committed to minimizing the impact on employees by treating them fairly, providing them with financial support, outplacement services, and retraining opportunities. Our aim here is to enable those affected to take advantage seekers. Let me emphasize: the vast majority of job reductions will come from natural attrition, retirements and internal mobility. Around 1,000 redundancies will result from the integration of Credit Suisse Schweiz. These will be spread over a couple of years, starting in late 2024. Importantly, in the alternative spin-off scenario, restructuring would also have been necessary, and resulted in about 600 redundancies. In addition, the necessity to profoundly restructure other parts of Credit Suisse is expected to lead to about 2,000 additional redundancies in Switzerland over the next couple of years. After weighing all of the above factors, we came to the view that a full integration is the best way forward. Our decision reinforces our commitment to clients, employees, and the Swiss economy. Our goal is to make the transition for clients as smooth as possible. The two Swiss ringfenced entities will operate separately until their planned legal integration in 2024. Credit Suisse brand and operations will remain separate during that time. We will gradually migrate clients onto our systems and expect to finish this process in 2025. Given this, nothing will change for clients in the foreseeable future and they do not have to take any immediate action. We will continue to provide the premier levels of service that they have come to expect. And with time they will begin to see the further benefits of the combined franchise. As we progress in the integration, we remain fully committed to our personal, private, institutional and corporate clients. In terms of lending, thanks to our even-stronger capital base, our intention is to keep the combined exposure unchanged while maintaining our risk discipline. We are sensitive to the important role both firms play in the lives of our employees and their communities. We want to remain an employer of choice in Switzerland, offering attractive career opportunities. Last but not least, as we combine, we will honor all agreed sponsorships of civic, sporting and cultural activities in Switzerland at least until the end of 2025. I have made it abundantly clear to our colleagues that they must not be distracted by the integration. We cannot take our eyes off our vision and must remain focused on client needs. After all, competition in the Swiss market remains robust. The cantonal banks in aggregate will continue to have the highest market shares in all relevant personal and commercial banking products. And our branch network, even after the merger, is the third-biggest. We welcome the challenge. Competition is what makes all of us better, and what makes the Swiss financial system stronger. Given the events leading up to the acquisition, stabilizing the Credit Suisse client franchises globally has been our most immediate priority. Since closing in June, we have won back clients’ confidence, as evidenced by positive asset flows and strong engagement across Wealth Management and the Swiss business. We saw formidable momentum in deposits, with 23 billion dollars in inflows for the quarter, 18 billion of which came into Credit Suisse’s Wealth Management and Swiss Bank. Meanwhile, UBS wealth management has delivered the highest second-quarter net new money performance in over a decade. We are pleased to share that this positive trend has carried on into July and August. While the quarter is not over yet, so far we have attracted net new assets of 8 billion for the combined wealth management businesses. It is encouraging and rewarding to see the franchise stabilize so quickly. Winning back the more than 200 billion dollars of client assets that left Credit Suisse over the past year won’t be easy, but recapturing as much as we can is one of our top priorities. Let’s move to assets that we have designated as non-core. First, let me briefly touch on the 9 billion RWAs that will be included in the combined Investment Bank. These assets were selected through a disciplined process designed to enhance our Global Banking and derivatives operations. The transferred businesses are expected to be accretive from next year. They will help drive economies of scale while adding only 13% to the investment bank’s current non op-risk RWAs. The remaining 17 billion of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, as you can see from the chart, will be transferred to the newly-formed Non-core and Legacy unit. This will also include Credit Suisse’s entire Capital Release Unit as well as selected assets from the combined wealth and asset management businesses that are not aligned with our risk appetite or strategy. Overall, the NCL will comprise of 224 billion in LRD, with a significant portion in high-quality and liquid assets, and 55 billion in risk weighted assets excluding op-risk RWAs. With the perimeter largely defined, we are already executing on our strategy to exit these assets in a timely and efficient manner. We made a good start in the second quarter, reducing positions representing a total of 9 billion in RWA. Around half of those came from sales that we actively pursued. As I mentioned before, this is not the first time our organization has managed a successful run-down of non- core assets. Our previous experience is a big part of why we are confident in our ultimate success. A clear priority for us is to take out a substantial part of the operating costs associated with this unit. I will touch on that in a minute. Thanks to our strong capital position, and markdowns we took as part of the PPA adjustments, we have substantial flexibility in order to optimize the outcome. These are not distressed assets, so we can maintain positions if they preserve value. Our decisions whether to do so will be based on economic profitability, taking into account funding, operating and capital costs of the portfolios. On those positions we do decide to exit, we will move at pace, acting fairly and protecting our clients and counterparties. The natural run-off profile is a steep one. As you can see from the chart, we will have a 50%, or 27 billion, reduction in non op-risk RWAs by 2026 and a similar reduction in LRD. But let me assure you that our proactive approach to accelerate the wind-down will continue. Now let’s turn to cost reductions, a key element of returning to profitability and creating sustainable value across the combined firm. First, as we speak, we are actively addressing the need for deep restructuring at Credit Suisse. This is an acceleration and expansion of the work that the firm itself saw as necessary to put a stop to losing money. Secondly, additional efforts are required to generate synergies across the combined businesses. We aim to take out over 10 billion dollars in gross expenses from the combined franchise, based on full-year 2022 cost base. Around half of that will come from restructuring the investment bank and running down non- core assets. The other half will come from actions across the rest of our operations. There is meaningful duplication that can be removed, thousands of applications and IT platforms to be decommissioned, and hundreds of legal entities to be merged or closed to make us more efficient and effective. Let me give you an example. Of Credit Suisse’s current 3,000+ IT applications only around 300 will be integrated into UBS infrastructure, contributing to our combined future business model. Importantly, we will continue investing to make our platforms and processes more resilient and support our existing, and future, growth ambitions. We will also absorb some further inflation. All told, we aim to bring the Group’s underlying cost/income ratio exit rate below 70% in 2026. We are two and a half months into one of the biggest and most complex bank mergers in history. We are executing our plans at pace and wasting no time in delivering value for our all our stakeholders, including shareholders. In the next four to six months our focus will be on restoring underlying profitability, while progressing on other areas, including business transformation, client migration and simplification of our combined legal entity structure. On the latter, a key milestone will be the merger of our parent operating entities UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. This step, planned for 2024, will allow us to simplify our structure and operating model, optimize capital and liquidity within the Group, and will support achieving our cost-savings ambitions. We expect to substantially complete our integration program by 2026. A key pillar of our strategy is to maintain a balance sheet for all seasons - one that supports our capital- generative business and allows us to offer attractive capital returns. We expect to operate at around 14% CET1 capital ratio over the medium term. And as we exit 2026, we aim to achieve an underlying return on CET1 of around 15%. As you know, we have suspended share repurchases for the time being. But we remain committed to growing our dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders through buybacks. We will update you on our plans With that, let me hand over to Todd.",['thank sarah good morning everyone hope relaxing summer break us past eight weeks intense busy writing next chapter ubs’s history

2Q23,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you, Sergio. Good morning everyone – it is a privilege to be with you today as Group CFO, especially at this watershed moment for UBS. Since my appointment, my focus has been on the financial consolidation of the two firms, progressing the work done on transaction adjustments, optimizing our liquidity and funding position, firming up our cost savings and enhancing financial reporting controls for the expanded group. Regardless of whether staff come from Credit Suisse or UBS, I’ve been extremely impressed with the dedication of the finance team. I’m proud of what we as a unit have already been able to accomplish, and we, like the entire firm, continue to execute at pace. We recognize that this is a complex deal, but our aim is to be clear and forthcoming in explaining the financial implications of our actions during this critical period and beyond. Today, I’ll cover our second quarter operating performance, the impact of the merger on our balance sheet and capital as of day 1 and, finally, our integration plan and outlook. include one month of Credit Suisse’s operating performance, presented under IFRS and in US dollars. largely driven by the net impact from items related to the acquisition, principally negative goodwill of 28.9 billion and integration-related expenses and acquisition costs. Excluding these items, the Group pre-tax profit was 1.1 billion, of which 2.0 billion from the UBS sub-group, and negative 0.8 billion from the Credit Suisse sub-group. consideration UBS paid and the fair value of the acquired net assets after taking into account the various PPA adjustments of negative 25 billion. The roughly 6 billion difference between the negative goodwill reported today and the amount included in the Form F4 registration statement just prior to closing is principally explained by two factors. First, Credit Suisse generated operating losses over the first 5 months of 2023 that were not captured in the F4, which was prepared as if the transaction occurred on December 31, 2022. Second, we applied additional net negative PPA adjustments to Credit Suisse’s financial assets and liabilities, reflecting a more detailed fair value assessment post-closing. The total net PPA adjustments of negative 25 billion consist primarily of marks of negative 14.7 billion in connection with financial assets and liabilities. This includes negative 12.4 billion on mainly fixed-rate accrual assets and liabilities, of which around 8 and half billion relates to our core businesses and around 4 billion to Non-core and Legacy. In addition, we made negative 2.3 billion of further necessary adjustments to fair value positions, mostly related to Non-core and Legacy. The negative 8 and a half billion of marks on core-business accrual financial instruments include, for example, PPA adjustments on the Swiss mortgage book, which were almost entirely interest rate driven. The majority of the accrual-basis positions are expected to mature within the next 3 to 4 years and, if held to maturity, will pull to par. Of the total marks on accrual positions, 6 billion pre-tax, or 5 billion net of tax, are CET1 capital-neutral as FINMA has granted us transitional relief, which mainly applies to Swiss mortgages. The transitional treatment is subject to linear amortization concluding by June 30, 2027. The negative marks of 2.3 billion on fair value assets and liabilities that I mentioned earlier reflect UBS’s assessment of the complexity, liquidity and model risk uncertainties in the book, as well as the relevant markets for potential strategic exits. We also made PPA adjustments of negative 4.5 billion to capture UBS’s determination of Credit Suisse’s provisions and contingent liabilities related to litigation, regulatory and similar matters. This includes 1.5 billion of incremental provisions Credit Suisse took in the second quarter. Other net PPA adjustments, totaling to negative 5 and a half billion, largely relate to GAAP differences associated with pension accounting, but also goodwill and intangibles, and fair value marks on non-financial assets and liabilities, including software and real estate. Of the total negative 25 billion of PPA adjustments, negative 17 billion is CET1 capital-relevant, with the balance relating to the 5 billion regulatory waiver I mentioned earlier, and other items that are filtered out of CET1 capital, such as pension accounting differences, goodwill and intangibles. Overall, we believe the negative goodwill, including the PPA adjustments therein – in addition to underpinning almost 240 billion of acquired RWA - provides us with sufficient capacity to absorb the costs to achieve our two key saving objectives: first, an efficient wind-down of the non-core businesses and associated overhead we acquired, and second, positive operating leverage and synergies in our core franchises. All while remaining capital-generative over the integration timeline. We are highly confident that we can successfully integrate Credit Suisse, enhancing our business model and operating metrics, while continuing to ensure we maintain world class capital ratios and a balance sheet for all seasons. we illustrate how the transaction strengthens key financial measures from day 1, offering us a highly attractive starting point as we commence this journey. Since the acquisition, our capital position is even stronger with almost 200 billion total loss absorbing capacity, and a CET1 capital ratio of 14.4%. Additionally, our tangible book value per share is up 49% quarter on quarter and, today, we manage over 5 and a half trillion dollars of invested assets with a unique and meaningful presence in all the major markets across the globe. reason why we were able to restore financial stability and client trust in such a short amount of time. As of the end of June, as just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.4% and our CET1 leverage ratio was 4.8%. Included in our capital ratio this quarter are the impacts from the closing of the Credit Suisse acquisition, including a 10 billion operational risk RWA reduction from diversification benefits and a combined lower forward-looking risk profile. Looking through to the end of the year, we expect our CET1 capital ratio to remain around 14%, as the benefit of RWA reductions, improvements in our underlying profitability, mainly from cost saves, and CET1 capital-relevant pull-to-par effects from the PPA adjustments are expected to largely, but not fully, offset integration-related expenses. We also expect to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% and a CET1 leverage ratio or more than 4% over the medium-term. You have often heard us referring to our balance sheet for all seasons and our capital-generative operating model that allows us to service clients and invest in the business through the cycle. It’s how we’ve operated over the last decade, and it’s how we intend to continue to operate going forward. So rest assured, maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons will remain among our very top priorities. well above our prior quarter level, and a net stable funding ratio of 118%. The liquidity coverage ratio increase largely reflects the elevated HQLA levels at Credit Suisse, including the effect of the usage of the Swiss National Bank facilities. As Sergio highlighted, positive net new deposits in the past few months enabled us to repay ELA+ and terminate the Public Liquidity Backstop facility, as announced earlier this month. We expect to continue attracting net new deposits, and as of this week we’ve already seen, in the third quarter, 13 billion of positive net new deposit flows in our combined wealth management and Swiss franchises. While this will help us narrow the inherited funding gap and continue to manage our liquidity coverage ratio at prudent levels, we expect to resume execution of our funding plans shortly. In addition to maintaining significant liquidity and funding buffers on a consolidated basis, we’re actively managing the allocation of financial resources among our significant legal entities, which also have standalone funding requirements and will continue to operate while we progress towards our target legal entity structure. We’re working towards merging Credit Suisse AG into UBS AG in 2024, as this is a critical step to removing resource allocation bottlenecks and enabling the realization of business and operational efficiencies. earlier, and a gain on sale of 848 million in Asset Management last year, UBS’s pre-tax profit in the quarter was 2.0 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Before turning to the UBS sub-group business divisions starting on page 23, let me first point out that for the second quarter, the negative goodwill as well as a substantial portion of integration-related expenses have been retained and reported in Group Functions. Starting with the third quarter, we intend to consolidate the reporting of our business divisions across the UBS and Credit Suisse sub-groups, and we’ll report integration- related expenses in the respective combined segments. All references to figures are in US dollars and comparisons are year-over-year, unless stated otherwise. In Global Wealth Management, we delivered net new money of 16 billion, the strongest second quarter in over a decade, with inflows across Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, and despite 5 billion in seasonal tax payments in the US. We also delivered net new fee generating assets of 13 billion, or an annualized growth rate of 4% with positive flows across all regions, as well as net new deposits of 5 billion. These strong inflows across net new money, fee-generating assets and deposits demonstrate our continuous focus on active client engagement and the trust our clients place in us. This was especially important during a quarter where the macro backdrop and developments with Credit Suisse placed a premium on our investment advice and the stability of our GWM franchise. Profit before tax was 1.1 billion, down 4% despite strong growth in EMEA and Switzerland of 15% and 9%, respectively. Positive top-line contributions from all regions outside of Americas supported a 1% revenue increase, which was more than offset by higher expenses. In the Americas, revenues were down 4% mainly as net interest income reflected continued rotation into higher yielding deposits and investments from transactional and sweep deposit accounts. Although we expect NII in the Americas to continue to tick-down sequentially from ongoing cash sorting and deleveraging in the current rates environment, we nevertheless continue to see the US market as a strategic priority for us, and hence we continue to invest in the business for future growth. As a result, we expect our pre-tax margin in the Americas to be low double-digit to mid-teens over the near-term. Onto total GWM revenues. Net interest income was up 14% year-over-year, and down 3% sequentially, the latter reflecting mix shifts and lower deposit and loan balances, partly offset by higher deposit margins. Recurring net fee income decreased 3% due to negative market performance while positive inflows were offset by clients’ continued repositioning into lower margin solutions. As a reminder, we bill based on daily balances in the Americas and on month-end balances everywhere else. As such, second quarter revenues did not fully reflect June’s market rally, which we’re seeing benefit the third quarter. Transaction-based income decreased 6%, impacted by investor uncertainty, particularly in Americas and APAC. However, towards the end of the second quarter and into the third, we’re seeing a pick-up in both client sentiment and transactional momentum especially in APAC. Operating expenses ex-litigation, integration-related expenses and FX were up 3% driven by increases in technology and personnel expenses. one-off gains. Profit before tax was up 54% to 612 million Swiss francs. Revenues increased 24%, with increases across all revenue lines, highlighting continued momentum in the business. Net interest income increased by 45% year on year and 12% quarter-on-quarter. Sequentially, we continued to see loan growth, while the deposit base remained roughly stable. Costs were up 9%, driven by continued tech investments and higher personnel expenses. The cost-to-income ratio was 51%, a 7 percentage-point improvement year-on- year, demonstrating strong positive operating leverage. We saw strong momentum with 10% annualized growth in net new investment products and almost 6 thousand net new clients, reflecting the trust our clients continue to place in us. Excluding last year’s gain on sale, total revenues decreased 5%, with lower net management fees, driven by market headwinds, asset mix, as well as lower performance fees. These headwinds were partially offset by 1% lower costs. Net new money in the quarter was strong at 17 billion, a 6% annualized growth rate. Net new money excluding money markets and associates was 19.5 billion, with positive momentum in SMAs and alternatives. The operating environment for the Investment Bank’s trading businesses was defined by significantly lower equity volatility levels compared to the prior-year period. Within Global Markets, this resulted in a meaningful decline in client activity levels across both Equities and FRC, where revenues of 1.5 billion were down 11%, broadly consistent with our peer group. on record. This demonstrates the resilience of our balanced portfolio of risk-efficient businesses, as we continue to invest in capabilities that are critical to our clients. Global Banking revenues of 371 million were down 2% as the second quarter saw the global fee pool hit its lowest quarterly level since 2012. In the second quarter we significantly outperformed the fee pool in EMEA and gained share in global M&A. Operating expenses were up 2%, predominantly on higher tech investments offsetting lower provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. (2.1bn) adjusted loss (CHF, US GAAP) earlier today. Credit Suisse AG’s reported pre-tax loss for the second quarter was 8.9 billion Swiss francs. This result includes several large items, including 2.2 billion in adjustments to fair value marks, 1.8 billion in software write-downs, 1.3 billion in additional litigation provisions, and 1.0 billion for a goodwill impairment. Stripping out these and other items that are not representative of Credit Suisse AG’s underlying performance in the quarter, the adjusted operating loss was 2.1 billion Swiss francs. consolidation scope. Including those entities, the Credit Suisse sub-group’s pro-forma second quarter adjusted operating loss was 2.0 billion Swiss francs. In discussing the Credit Suisse sub-group performance in the second quarter, I’ll focus on this 2-billion Swiss franc adjusted loss as it better informs the starting point for the group in combination with UBS’s quarterly underlying performance.

2Q23,Corporate Center.,"Sequentially, revenues declined by 38%, driven by Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank, down 78%, where the sharp drop in revenues was due to little-to-no new activity in the context of expected exits following the acquisition. Second quarter revenues also reflected elevated funding costs, primarily from the Swiss National Bank facilities. Going forward, we’ll focus on two key priorities in relation to Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and Capital Release Unit. First, rebuild activity and profitability levels of the businesses we decided to retain as part of our core Investment Bank. And second, actively manage the wind-down of businesses and positions that are not aligned to our strategy. These include those already in the Credit Suisse Capital Release Unit and Investment Bank not retained as core, and will be managed and reported within our Non-Core and Legacy segment beginning in the third quarter. Moreover, as the wind down is executed, we’ll decisively take out all costs in relation to resources, technology and real estate that are not needed to support either what is retained in our core Investment Bank or what is strictly required to efficiently wind-down businesses and positions managed by our Non-core and Legacy team. In contrast to Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and Capital Release Unit, we saw relative stability across Credit Suisse’s Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management segments. In Credit Suisse Wealth Management, we’ve seen a stabilization of net new assets, trending from substantial outflows in April to net inflows in June, with 14 billion dollars of net new deposits in the quarter. We remain focused on introducing Credit Suisse’s clients to the unrivaled value proposition of the combined firm to counterbalance any headwinds to our flows from lag effects stemming from past or future attrition of Credit Suisse relationship managers. In addition to clear and decisive actions to retain client assets, we also implemented client advisor incentive programs with the clear objective to “win back” and sustainably retain client assets. Quarter to date, these actions have helped us to attract net new deposits of 10 billion dollars and positive net new assets in the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise. Credit Suisse’s adjusted operating expenses were down 10% sequentially, reflecting actions initiated before and after the merger announcement, as well as voluntary attrition of employees. As of the end of the second quarter, headcount was down by over 8,000 compared to the end of 2022, split roughly equally between internal and external staff. 2.0 billion, and the Credit Suisse sub-group pre-tax loss of 2.2 billion, after translation to US dollars, equals a combined pro forma Group operating loss of around negative 0.3 billion. You can consider this indicative level as a useful starting point to contextualize the trajectory of our underlying profitability going forward, and assess the steps we are taking to achieve our ambitions. First and foremost, we’re executing on our cost reduction plans at pace and we expect positive combined underlying profits in the second half of 2023. We expect to deliver underlying exit rate cost savings of over 3 integration-related expenses in 2H23. While neutral to our underlying performance, I would note that such integration-related expenses will be partly offset by pull-to-par effects of over 1 and a half billion. Second, asset and deposit retention and win-back initiatives will continue to support the positive momentum across our wealth management businesses. In particular we expect to see positive underlying contribution from the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise by the first half of 2024. We will apply this same systematic approach to client and asset retention and win-back across all of our core franchises, especially following today’s announcement in connection with the Swiss businesses. National Bank facilities that Credit Suisse reported in its Corporate Center. The repayment of these facilities will lead to materially lower funding costs in the third quarter and further benefits in the fourth quarter for the combined Group. Continuing on the NII topic, sequentially for 3Q23, we expect a low single-digit percentage decline in our combined wealth management businesses, with positive contribution from the Credit Suisse franchise, and a mid-single-digit percentage decline in our Swiss businesses. This excludes the pull to par effects I mentioned earlier. These elements, in combination with disciplined resource management and a focused execution mindset across the leadership team, give us confidence in our ability to deliver a successful integration, starting with approaching break-even in the third quarter and returning to positive underlying profitability before the end of the year. With that I’ll hand back to Sergio for his closing remarks. Sergio P. Ermotti – closing remarks Thank you, Todd. As we speak, the geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook remains volatile and difficult to predict. Of course, major developments on this front will impact our business in the short term. As always, our first priority is to stay close to clients and help them manage the challenges and opportunities presented by this uncertain environment. For us, this is business as usual and we remain focused on this priority. At the same time, we will also execute on our integration plans with determination and pace. That will unlock significant economies of scale allowing us to fund future investments as we continue to pursue growth opportunities. We are well aware of the additional trust and responsibility that accompany this transaction. We will not betray that trust, remaining faithful to our strong culture and conservative risk management. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. I strongly believe UBS will emerge as a stronger global financial institution, one of even greater value to its clients, while remaining safe and delivering superior returns.

2Q24,Group Chief Financial Officer,Including analyst Q&A session,['including analyst q&a session']
2Q24,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. It has been a little over a year since the closing of the acquisition. We made significant progress and UBS continues to deliver on all of its commitments to stakeholders. Putting the needs of clients first during a challenging market environment has allowed us to maintain solid momentum while we fulfill our objective of completing the integration by the end of 2026. As a consequence, not only we have dramatically reduced the execution risk of the integration, we are also well positioned to meet all of our financial targets - and return to the level of profitability UBS delivered before being asked to step in and stabilize Credit Suisse. I am particularly proud to note that across the combined organization our people are embracing the pillars, principles and behaviors that drive UBS’s culture. These include client centricity and collaboration and enable us to successfully manage risk and act with accountability and integrity. I’d like to thank all my colleagues around the world for their dedication and hard work. franchises and disciplined implementation of our strategy and integration plans. Reported net profit for the first half was 2.9 billion, with underlying PBT of 4.7 billion and an underlying return on CET1 capital of 9.2%. We strengthened our capital position and maintained a balance sheet for all seasons, with a CET1 capital ratio of 14.9% and total loss-absorbing capacity of around 200 billion. Our parent bank is well capitalized, even after withstanding the removal of significant regulatory concessions previously granted to Credit Suisse. As a result, we are executing on our 2024 capital return plans and, as I mentioned last quarter, we are committed to delivering on our mid-to-long term ambitions for dividends and buybacks. Turning to the integration, we have captured nearly half of our targeted gross cost savings as we restructure our core businesses and wind down Non-core and Legacy, where we have materially reduced risk-weighted assets over the last twelve months. As part of our de-risking efforts, we have also made good progress addressing Credit Suisse’s legacy legal issues, including the Supply Chain Finance Funds and Mozambique matters. Following these intense months of execution, during which we obtained more than 180 approvals from roughly 80 regulators in more than 40 jurisdictions, we completed the mergers of our parent and Swiss banks, and transitioned to a single U.S. intermediate holding company. This clears the way for the next set of critical milestones that will support the realization of further integration synergies. But let me reiterate something you’ve heard me say before: We still have a lot of work ahead of us to address Credit Suisse’s structural lack of sustainable profitability. While we are encouraged by the significant progress we have made across the Group, the path to restoring profitability to the pre-acquisition levels won’t be linear. We are now entering the next phase of our integration which will be key to realizing the further substantial cost, capital, funding and tax benefits necessary to deliver on our 2026 financial targets. We are following through on our plans amid heightened uncertainties in the markets. These are the moments in which UBS proves its strength, resilience and superior ability to serve and advise clients. This is reflected in the trust that our clients have placed in us every quarter since the close, with a total of 127 billion in net new assets. We’ve also remained focused on our strategic objectives to enhance our client offering and leverage the breadth, scale and synergies of our combined franchises. In the Investment Bank, I am pleased by the client response to the strategic additions we have made to reinforce our capabilities and competitive position. The first-half performance is a positive signal that the investments are paying off. In Global Markets we saw the highest second quarter on record. And in Global Banking we have captured sizeable market share gains. We are also increasing collaboration across the firm as GWM clients continue to benefit from our IB products and capabilities. This drove the majority of wealth management’s expansion of client activity this year, particularly in the Americas and APAC. Another example is our newly created Unified Global Alternatives unit which combines our Alternatives investment capabilities across GWM and Asset Management. In fact, this is not just an internal cooperation. We are reshaping the competitive landscape by effectively creating a top-5 global player and Limited Partner with 250 billion in invested assets across hedge funds, private equity, private credit, infrastructure and real estate. Unified Global Alternatives will offer our institutional, wholesale, wealth management clients a more comprehensive offering and enhanced access to exclusive co-investment opportunities. It will also provide General Partners with a single point of access to the full distribution power of our firm. In Asset Management, we are offsetting margin compression by increasing operational efficiency, which is one of the key focus areas for the business. In Switzerland, we continue to enjoy the trust of our clients, despite a very competitive and, at times, less-than- constructive environment. With around 30 billion Swiss francs in net new deposits in the last 13 months and approximately 350 billion of loans extended to clients, we continue to maintain our role as an important engine of credit. Since the acquisition we granted or renewed around 85 billion Swiss francs of loans. Higher interest rates, the cost of increased regulatory, capital and liquidity requirements, a changing macroeconomic outlook, and, last but not least, the necessity to reprice some loans granted by Credit Suisse at unacceptable risk-returns are having an impact on pricing of new credit. Of course, those are not always easy discussions to have with clients, but we are constructively engaging with them, and I believe the vast majority understand the rationale. Switzerland is a key pillar of our strategy and we are fully committed to maintaining our leadership. Swiss clients and the economy benefit from UBS’s unparalleled, competitive global reach and capabilities. In turn, our Swissness is a unique differentiator when serving clients around the world. As a testament of this symbiosis, we were recognized by Euromoney as Switzerland’s Best Bank for the tenth time since 2012 and the world’s best bank. As we continue our integration journey in the Swiss business, we believe it will be important to further communicate with all our stakeholders about our approach and strategy. To that end, in September, our head of Switzerland, Sabine Keller-Busse, will present at our flagship Best of Switzerland conference, which brings together investors and corporate clients. Looking ahead and more broadly, ongoing geopolitical tensions and anticipation ahead of U.S. elections will likely result in heightened market volatility compared to the first half of the year. In this environment we have two key priorities: First, we must continue to help clients manage the challenges and opportunities that arise. Second, we must stay focused and not allow short-term market dynamics to distract us from achieving our ultimate goal, which is to continue to execute on the integration and invest strategically to position UBS for long-term value creation. The management appointments we announced in the second quarter will enable us to continue to progress on this journey. At the same time, we can put even more emphasis on our priorities and prospects for sustainable growth, particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are confident this will also help us to deliver better outcomes for our clients and the communities where we live and work. With that, I hand over to Todd.",['thank you sarah good morning everyone little year since closing acquisition made significant progress ubs continues deliver commitments stakeholders putting needs

2Q24,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you Sergio, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong underlying profitability, and we made further progress in reducing costs and optimizing our balance sheet. Net profit in the quarter was 1.1 billion. Our EPS was 34 cents and our underlying return on CET1 capital was 8.4%. Throughout my remarks today, I refer to underlying performance in US dollars and make comparisons to our performance in the first quarter, unless stated otherwise. From the third quarter onwards, we’ll revert to making year-on-year comparisons as, by then, the prior year period will fully capture combined performance post the Credit Suisse acquisition. businesses holding up nicely from a strong first quarter, down 2% sequentially. Net interest income headwinds were partially offset by higher recurring fee income in our wealth and Swiss businesses, and by improving activity in IB capital markets. Revenues in our Non-core and Legacy business were positive in the quarter, albeit 0.6 billion lower versus an exceptional first quarter. On a reported basis, revenues reached 11.9 billion and included 0.8 billion of mainly purchase price allocation adjustments in our core businesses, with an additional 0.6 billion expected in the third quarter. Underlying operating expenses in the quarter were 9 billion, decreasing by 3%. Excluding litigation and variable and Financial Advisor compensation tied to production, expenses were also down 3% as we further progressed our cost-cutting and workforce-management initiatives despite the intense integration agenda. At the end of the second quarter, there were about 35 hundred fewer total staff compared to the end of the first quarter, and 23 thousand, or 15%, fewer since the end of 2022. Integration-related expenses in the quarter were 1.4 billion, resulting in reported operating expenses of 10.3 billion. Credit loss expense was 95 million, driven by a small number of positions in our Swiss corporate loan book. Our tax expense in the quarter was 293 million, representing an effective rate of 20%, helped by NCL’s performance and the initial positive effects of completed legal entity mergers. In the second half of 2024, excluding the effects of any DTA re-valuation, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 35%, mainly as expected pre-tax losses in legacy Credit Suisse entities can’t be fully offset against profits elsewhere in the Group. The tax rate could benefit if NCL continues to perform better-than-expected. We continue to expect the ongoing optimization of our legal entity structure to gradually support a return to a normalized tax rate of around 23% by 2026. Exiting the second quarter, we achieved an additional 900 million in gross cost saves when compared to three months earlier, bringing the cumulative total since the end of 2022 to 6 billion, or around 45% of our total gross cost save ambition. We estimate that around half of this quarter’s saves benefit our underlying opex with the other half reinvested as planned in our technology estate as well as to offset increases in variable and Financial Advisor compensation tied to production. To date we’ve generated around 4 billion of net saves, primarily driven by NCL, which has shed around 3 and a half billion of its 2022 cost baseline. Following the legal entity mergers, we now turn our focus to the critical client account and platform migration work planned for our core businesses. We start in the fourth quarter with GWM’s booking hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg, followed thereafter by client account transitions in our Swiss booking center, which supports both GWM and P&C. Along with our ongoing cost run-down efforts in Non-core and Legacy, these initiatives represent the most material drivers of future cost savings as we decommission technology systems, hardware and data centers, while also unlocking further staff capacity. As I highlighted last quarter, the pace of saves is expected to moderately decelerate from the quarterly run rates observed over the last several quarters while we prepare for, and initially undertake, these significant integration activities. We expect to pick-up the pace as we implement these transitions throughout 2025 and into 2026, particularly benefiting the cost/income ratios of GWM and P&C. The rate at which we are incurring integration-related expenses, which front-run underlying opex saves, is also indicative of the headway we’re making on costs. In the second half, we expect to book 2.3 billion of integration-related expenses, of which 1.1 billion in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we expect to have incurred around 70% of total costs to achieve our 2026 exit rate efficiency targets. Moving to our balance sheet. In the second quarter we reduced risk-weighted assets by a further 15 billion, of which 8 billion from the active run-down of positions in our Non-core and Legacy portfolio, which I will come back to shortly. Over 8 billion of the decline was seen across the core business divisions, mainly resulting from the financial resource optimization work in GWM and P&C. As I highlighted earlier in the year, this work is addressing sub- hurdle returns on capital deployed, including by reducing deposit and loan volumes. The upshot is additional capacity to absorb headwinds from regulatory and risk methodology changes, model harmonization between the two banks, and the implementation of Basel 3 Final, now confirmed for January 2025. While we continue active dialogue with our supervisor on various aspects of the final rules, at present we continue to expect the Day 1 impact of Basel 3 Final to be around 5% of RWA, driven mainly by FRTB. We’ll update our estimates by no later than the fourth quarter as requirements firm. Our leverage ratio denominator decreased by 35 billion in the quarter. This reduction was driven by several factors, including full repayment of the central bank ELA facility granted to Credit Suisse, lower lending volumes, mainly from our financial resource optimization efforts, and the active run-down of our NCL portfolio. We ended the second quarter with an LCR of 212%, reflecting the ELA repayment, and TLAC of 198 billion. The numerator reflects accruals of this year’s expected dividend and a reserve for 2024 share repurchases, of which we have executed 467 million of the planned 1 billion, as of last Friday. Additionally, our CET1 capital includes all relevant portions of the purchase price allocation adjustments made to Credit Suisse’s equity as of the acquisition date last June. With the 12-month measurement period now concluded, total PPA adjustments against the purchased equity of Credit Suisse amounted to negative 26.5 billion, of which about 70% reduced CET1 capital. Following completion of the parent bank merger earlier in the quarter, next week we’ll report UBS AG’s consolidated and standalone capital ratios and other information for the first time on a combined basis. UBS AG’s standalone CET1 capital ratio at quarter-end is expected at 13.5% on a fully applied basis. To put this capital ratio in perspective, it’s important to compare the way we manage our parent bank capital versus Credit Suisse’s pre-acquisition practices. We provide for the complete transition of the risk-weight rule changes applicable to UBS AG’s subsidiary investments, which overall are valued prudently. Moreover, we don’t depend on any affiliate valuation concession from the regulator. This was not the case with Credit Suisse before the take-over, where its approach overstated the parent bank’s resilience, and ultimately limited restructuring optionality. In this context, our merged parent bank already provides for around 20 billion of additional capital resulting from the acquisition, including the progressive add-ons from growth in balance sheet and market share that will be phased-in over five years starting in 2026. The result is a parent bank capital buffer of around 100 basis points above the current fully-applied requirement by 2030. GWM’s pre-tax profit was 1.2 billion on revenues of 5.8 billion, which were up 3% year-over-year on an estimated, combined basis. Against a complex economic backdrop, clients sought our differentiated advice and solutions as evidenced by continued strong momentum in net new asset inflows and transactional activity. Overall, we generated 27 billion of net new assets, a growth rate of 2.7%, with positive inflows across all regions. I’m particularly pleased with this result considering the variety of headwinds to net new asset growth that the business successfully navigated in the quarter, including around 6 billion in seasonal tax outflows in the US. Let me unpack this further. To date, we’ve retained the vast majority of Credit Suisse’s invested assets notwithstanding that more than 40% of Credit Suisse’s wealth advisors have left since October 2022. I would also note that these relationship managers advised on only 20% of assets, meaning that, overall, we’ve retained the more productive Credit Suisse advisors, a testament to the appeal of our platform. We’ve also kept around 80% of the first large wave of maturing fixed term deposits from last year’s win-back campaign, with the peak in maturities expected in the third quarter. Furthermore, we made strong progress this quarter in our efforts to increase profitability on sub-hurdle relationships. Higher returns come from both driving increased platform revenue and proactively exiting sub- par loans, with these actions in the quarter boosting the revenue over RWA margin by around 30 basis points sequentially. Lastly, from a macro standpoint, the equity capital markets, and in particular IPO activity, ordinarily a significant driver of wealth creation and net new asset generation, have only recently started to recover. These dynamics underscore the basis of our short-term annual guidance of 100 billion for 2024 and 2025 and, equally, the resilience of our net new asset achievement in the quarter as well as the high level of client conviction in our advice and solutions. Now, onto details of GWM’s financial performance. Revenues declined 2% sequentially, as lower NII and the expected sequential drop in transactional activity, were partially offset by growth in recurring net fee income, supported by higher average levels of fee generating assets. Net interest income decreased by 2% sequentially to 1.6 billion, driven by ongoing deposit mix shifts and declining loan volumes, partially offset by our repricing actions, which as mentioned support higher returns on capital and net interest margin. Looking towards year-end, we maintain our previous guidance that full year 2024 NII will be roughly flat versus 4Q23 annualized. This includes a low-to-mid single digit percentage sequential drop in the third quarter, driven by a decrease in volumes, mix shifts in anticipation of falling rates, and the impact on our replication portfolios. In arriving at this outlook, and in light of recent rates volatility, we’re modeling 100 basis points of US dollar policy rate reductions by the end of 2024. The outlook for net interest income in our US wealth business is expected to be influenced by competitive dynamics affecting the pricing of sweep deposits. By the middle of 4Q24, we intend to adjust the sweep deposit rates in our US advisory accounts, which, net of offsetting factors, are expected to reduce pre-tax profits by around 50 million annually. Looking across our wealth business beyond year-end, we expect an inflection point in GWM net interest income around the time implied forwards reach a structural floor and stabilize, and clients begin to re-leverage, driving loan balances and NII higher. Moreover, it’s essential to consider that GWM’s diversified and CIO-driven fee-generating business model has proven both its appeal to clients and ability to drive profitable growth, even during past periods of low or negative interest rates. Consequently, in addition to increased lending, it’s reasonable to expect that lower interest rates will spur increased transactional activity, mandate sales and investments in alternatives across our wealth business. Recurring net fee income increased by 3% to 3.1 billion from higher client balances. Net sales in our UBS managed account offerings showed continued momentum, contributing to a sequentially higher recurring net fee margin in the quarter. Transaction-based revenues decreased quarter-on-quarter to 1.1 billion, but notably increased around 14% year-on-year on an estimated, combined basis, with APAC up around 30% and the Americas up over 20%, and broadly flat sequentially versus a strong first quarter. Both regions performed exceptionally well in structured products as clients sought customized investment opportunities in an environment of low volatility, high interest rates, and continued global tech appeal. I would also highlight that our investments in combining GWM and IB markets and solutions capabilities in the Americas are paying off as evidenced by our transactional revenue performance over the first half of the year, up around 20% versus the same period in 2023. Expenses were roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. Excluding compensation-related effects, underlying operating expenses dropped 2% sequentially. As highlighted earlier, the upcoming client account migration work is expected to be a significant driver of cost reductions in GWM throughout 2025 and into 2026. million Swiss francs. Revenues were down 4% sequentially, driven by an 8% decline in net interest income that was partly offset with increases in recurring net fees and transaction-based revenues. P&C’s NII in the quarter was primarily affected by higher liquidity costs and the SNB’s 25 basis point interest rate cut from March, as we kept our Swiss clients’ deposit pricing unchanged. In the third quarter, we expect NII to tick down sequentially by a low single digit percentage, mainly due to the effects of the SNB’s second 25 basis-point rate cut from late June. In US dollar terms, we expect NII to be roughly flat sequentially. Despite these effects, as well as higher costs related to the SNB’s move earlier in the quarter to raise minimum reserve requirements, we nevertheless reaffirm our full-year 2024 guidance of a mid-to-high single digit percentage decline versus 4Q23 annualized, supported by our balance sheet actions. In arriving at this outlook, we are currently pricing-in up to two further Swiss franc policy rate reductions of 25 basis points each by the end of 2024. Assuming Swiss franc interest rates stabilize next year, as the forward rate curve presently implies, we expect shortly thereafter to see steadying volumes and an inflection point in P&C’s net interest income. We also expect by then that our balance sheet optimization work will be largely complete, with loan pricing reflecting a more appropriate cost of risk across the Swiss credit book. These efforts are necessary to restore returns on capital deployed and net interest margin in our Swiss business to pre-acquisition levels. In this respect, we saw net new lending outflows of 3.4 billion Swiss francs this quarter, driven by repricing of sub-hurdle volumes, despite having renewed or granted new loans to our Swiss clients of around 30 billion Swiss francs in 2Q. Transaction-based revenues were up 2% mainly from higher credit card usage. Recurring net fee income gained 3% on higher custody assets. Together, these non-NII revenue lines, up 2%, demonstrate the business’s effectiveness in staying close to clients and minimizing merger dis-synergies. Credit loss expense was 92 million, driven by a small number of positions in our corporate loan book, as I mentioned earlier. Even with the increased focus on risk-based pricing for maturing loan positions, our Swiss credit portfolio remains of very high quality, with an impaired loan ratio of 1.1%, down sequentially, albeit up versus pre-Credit Suisse acquisition levels. For the foreseeable future, we expect CLE to remain at broadly similar levels given increased book-size post merger, the relative strength of the Swiss franc and some economic softness in the main Swiss export markets. Operating expenses were flat sequentially. Similar to GWM, future cost reductions in P&C will be closely tied to the client account and platform migration work for Booking Center Switzerland, planned to commence by the second quarter of 2025. This quarter’s result included a gain of 28 million from the initial portion of the sale of our Brazilian real estate fund management business. In the third quarter, we expect to record an additional 60 million in underlying pre-tax profit on gains from disposals, mainly from closing the residual portions of this transaction. Net new money was negative 12 billion, with continued client demand for our SMA offering in the US and positive contribution from our China JVs, only partly compensating outflows across asset classes, particularly equities. While integration efforts to consolidate platforms may constrain AM’s net new money performance over the next few quarters, we expect our enhanced global reach and increased scale in alternatives and indexing to at least partially offset these headwinds. Net management fees dropped 5% as outflows in select active products weighed on margins. Performance fees were roughly stable in the quarter. During 2Q, AM made strong progress in improving operational efficiency, a key focus area I highlighted during the investor update earlier this year. Operating expenses were 9% lower sequentially on reductions across both non-personnel and personnel costs, partially supported by lower variable compensation. Some of the sequential decline in variable comp is expected to normalize in the third quarter. year basis. The IB delivered a strong second quarter result with improving capital markets activity supporting an excellent Banking quarter. Our Markets businesses performed well in an environment reflecting mixed market trends, in particular low volatility in equities, rates and FX, as well as lower cash equity volumes in APAC, where we’re overweight. Operating profit was 412 million, up from an operating loss of 14 million a year earlier, and up 2% sequentially, as the investment banking backdrop continues to improve. Investments to deepen our US presence are having a positive impact on revenues, as are contributions of Credit Suisse talent across key sectors of Banking and",['thank sergio good morning everyone

2Q24,Markets.,"Underlying revenues grew by 26% to 2.5 billion with nearly two thirds of the increase coming from the Americas. I would highlight that our revenue growth was achieved with broadly similar levels of RWA, as the IB continues to manage within the Group RWA limit of 25%, excluding NCL. Banking revenues were up 55% as we outperformed global fee pools, both in capital markets and advisory. Since the end of 2023, we have gained over a percentage point in market share in each of our strategic banking initiatives, including M&A and sponsors in the Americas. Regionally, APAC saw revenues nearly double, while the US was up 83%. EMEA declined by 3% against a very strong prior period. Capital Markets revenues were up 82% year-over-year with an outstanding LCM performance reflecting an increase in refinancing activity, mainly in the US. Advisory revenues increased by 23% as we leveraged our strong position in APAC to benefit from increased activity and performed well in the Americas. The strength of our fully integrated coverage teams is visible in our ability to win new mandates, where we rank 7th globally in announced M&A volumes, making for an encouraging deal pipeline. While we expect to continue capturing market share, macro and geopolitical factors are likely to weigh on continued sequential Banking revenue growth in the near term. Revenues in Markets reached 1.8 billion, the best second quarter result in over a decade, up 18% year-on-year and driven by the Americas, up nearly 40%. Equities revenues were up 17%, driven by both Derivatives and Cash, where we have seen material gains in market share. FRC was up 20% with broad increases across FX, credit and rates, benefitting from higher client activity, particularly in FX and rates options, partially offset by lower activity and spread compression that affected our rates flow business. Operating expenses rose 12%, predominantly reflecting higher variable compensation linked to improved performance. Non-core and Legacy’s pre-tax loss in the quarter was 80 million, supported by around 400 million in revenues, principally from gains on position exits across corporate credit and securitized products, and further reductions in the NCL cost base. Underlying opex was down 37% sequentially, helped by releases in litigation reserves of 172 million. Excluding litigation, operating expenses declined by 17%, as we made strong progress driving down personnel costs and third party spend. NCL’s six-month pre-tax profit of 117 million, which far exceeds earlier loss expectations, demonstrates the business’s skillful management in de-risking its portfolios and rapidly cutting its costs. For the second half of the year, we expect an underlying pre-tax loss of around 1 billion, reflecting moderate short-term upside to revenues, and continued sequential progress on cost reduction, albeit at a slower rate than observed over recent quarters. Over the last four quarters, NCL has made impressive progress running down its costs across all lines, cutting its underlying operating expense base by over 2 billion, or around 50%. NCL has also excelled in running down its balance sheet positions, significantly contributing to Group capital efficiency, releasing 5 billion in capital as a result of its efforts. Additionally, NCL has cut its non-operational risk-weighted assets by almost 60% over the last year, including by another 8 billion this quarter, mainly from actively exiting positions across its portfolios, notably in investment grade and high-yield corporate credit, securitized products, and macro. Similarly, NCL’s LRD is down by over 60% since 2Q23, dropping another 40 billion of leverage exposure this quarter, reflecting lower notionals as well as lower levels of HQLA. In terms of book closures, NCL shuttered another 10% of its active books in the quarter, bringing the total since last June to around 45%. Looking ahead, the progress we are making is visible in the natural roll-off profile, significantly narrowing the gap to our active run-down expectation of around 5% of Group RWA by 2026. Further supporting this and as additional evidence of NCL’s proficiency in de-risking its balance sheet and driving down costs, yesterday we agreed to sell Credit Suisse’s US mortgage servicing business.

3Q23,Group Chief Financial Officer,Including analyst Q&A session,['including analyst q&a session']
3Q23,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter and as we speak, we continue to see an evolution of the macroeconomic outlook with opinions, forecasts and markets changing at a very rapid pace. In addition, we witnessed an even further deterioration of the geopolitical landscape as a result of tragic events in the Middle East. Our thoughts are with those who are suffering and have been impacted by this violence, as well as our affected employees. While we have been very busy executing on our integration plans, our top priority is always to stay close to clients, helping them protect their assets and position their portfolios and businesses for future opportunities. Our wealth management clients remain cautious and defensively positioned. And while some of our institutional clients are taking advantage of short-term opportunities, many still remain on the sidelines. Our consistent dedication continues to be rewarded by their confidence and trust in UBS. This was demonstrated by another quarter of strong flows across GWM and P&C. In the third quarter, the first full quarter since the acquisition, we made strong progress and delivered underlying profitability. With respect to the integration of Credit Suisse, we continue to be encouraged by our achievements to date in both our planning and execution. In terms of the lessons learned from the events in March, we welcome the recent reports issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board and the Swiss Expert Group on Banking Stability. Their findings confirmed our view that the crisis was not a result of insufficient capital or liquidity requirements. Rather, the reports emphasized sustainable business models, risk-adjusted profitability, and importantly, the critical role of robust risk management cultures and effective governance. We take comfort in these conclusions, as they have been and remain core principles of UBS. Today, we are positioning UBS to be an even stronger and safer global financial institution. It is for this reason that we remain confident the acquisition will allow us to deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders, notwithstanding potential macroeconomic or geopolitical challenges. leverage at the Group level. GWM, P&C and Asset Management all delivered underlying PBT growth. IB performance was impacted by market conditions that were unfavorable to our business model and investments we expect to be accretive in future quarters. Our capital position remained strong with a CET1 ratio of 14.4% and total loss-absorbing capacity of nearly 200 billion. We achieved this result while incurring 2 billion in integration-related expenses and making good progress running down non-core assets. Despite our reported loss in the quarter, we incurred over 500 million in tax expense, and paid over 200 million in cash taxes in Switzerland. Our confidence in the ability to successfully integrate Credit Suisse and create substantial long-term value is supported by the strong progress we made in the third quarter. We have now stabilized Credit Suisse and continued to grow our franchise through new client acquisition and share-of-wallet gains. In addition, our client retention and win-back strategy is working. Net new money in GWM was 22 billion and our strong deposit momentum continued through the quarter. The 33 billion in net new deposits across GWM and P&C also supported our ability to reduce quarterly funding costs by 450 million through the repayment of the Public Liquidity Backstop and the ELA+ that we announced in August. We are pleased to see strong demand for UBS debt in the wholesale markets with transactions priced at similar levels to where UBS paper stood before the rescue of Credit Suisse. We have finalized the perimeter of Non-core and Legacy, and our efforts to actively unwind positions resulted in a capital release of around 1 billion. Lastly, we continued to execute our plans to reduce costs in Non-core and Legacy, restructure Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and remove duplications across our operations. We have already delivered around 3 billion in annualized exit-rate gross cost savings. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse Wealth Management’s quarterly net new money has now turned positive for the first time in a year and a half, with 3 billion in the third quarter. UBS Wealth Management’s 18 billion in net new money is the second highest third-quarter result in over a decade. In addition, it was satisfying to see that our efforts to win back client assets resulted in 22 billion in net new deposits from Credit Suisse clients across GWM and P&C. Following our decision to integrate Credit Suisse Schweiz, we reached out to our clients to re-assure them that we remain committed to delivering the best capabilities of both institutions. In addition, we reiterated that their credit limits across both banks will remain in place. To date, client reactions have been broadly constructive and net new deposits in P&C were positive in both Personal and Corporate banking client segments. We are particularly pleased that this was also the case in September, the month following our decision to integrate both franchises. In Non-core and Legacy, we also made strong progress this quarter. 80% of the sequential reduction in NCL’s credit and market risk risk weighted assets was driven by actively running down positions, executed above marks. Non-operational risk weighted assets have now been reduced by nearly one-third since 1Q23 and the expected natural run-off profile has improved by 3 billion. While we have some credit risk exposure in certain local emerging markets and other more complicated bilateral positions that resulted in CLEs this quarter, the key risks across the portfolio are well understood, actively managed and in most cases, well hedged. The majority of our credit risk exposure is with high-quality borrowers. Over 75% of the exposure is rated investment grade. This provides us with the comfort to continue to pursue our strategy to accelerate the disposal of these assets in a way that optimizes value for our shareholders, while also protecting our clients and counterparties. The finalized perimeter of Non-core and Legacy contains 30 billion in operational risk weighted assets. As a function of the natural decay across the portfolio, we expect a reduction of around 50% by the end of 2026. Todd will take you through this in more detail. Returning to the integration, let me reiterate that the complexity is not just from managing two G-SIFI banks. Our immediate priority since the transaction was announced and closed had to be on stabilizing and restructuring Credit Suisse. This will continue to be the case until the early part of 2024. see a selection of our recent achievements. Notably, we have established management responsibilities and operating models across business divisions and legal entities, including in our Swiss franchise. You can also see some of our key priorities through the end of this year and beyond. This includes the merger of our significant legal entities, client migrations across all of our business divisions and executing on our technology decommissioning plans. Last but not least, we are also working toward finalizing our 3-year strategic plan, which we will present in early February. As we continue to progress our plan, the main focus has been on delivering synergies for the combined Group. We remain confident that the 2026 goals that we presented last quarter are achievable. But, as | said then, it will not be a straight-line journey. We are pleased that the first phase of gross cost savings has already been executed in 2023. But I am sure we all appreciate the significant costs associated with running and combining two G-SIFIs, one of which is still structurally unprofitable. From an operational standpoint of view, it is clear that 2024 will be a pivotal year. Completing the merger of our significant legal entities before the end of next year is a critical step to enable us to unlock the next phase of our cost, capital and funding synergies, which we expect to realize in 2025 and 2026. Our enhanced scale, leading client franchises and increased future earnings power will position us for growth. Disciplined execution will continue to be an important driver for our performance and we are on track to deliver on our plans. We are optimistic about our future as we build an even stronger and safer version of the UBS that was called upon to stabilize the financial system in March, and one that all of our key stakeholders can be proud of. With that, I hand over to Todd.",['thank you sarah good morning everyone third quarter speak continue see evolution macroeconomic outlook opinions forecasts markets changing rapid pace addition

3Q23,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you and good morning everyone. As Sergio highlighted, we are executing on our plans at pace. In our first full quarter since the Credit Suisse acquisition, we’ve delivered underlying profitability and maintained strong client momentum with impressive net new money inflows in Global Wealth Management and net new deposit growth in our Swiss franchise. We also made substantial progress in de-risking our Non-core and Legacy portfolio, reinforcing our balance sheet for all seasons. Before I move on to discussing details of our financial performance, let me describe the reporting changes we implemented this quarter and the ones we expect to introduce soon. reflecting the way we’re managing our businesses and engaging with clients. In addition to Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management and the Investment Bank, we are now separately reporting Non-Core and Legacy as well as Group Items, all of which reflect the combined performance of UBS and Credit Suisse under IFRS and in US dollars. As I said during the second quarter earnings call, our aim is to be clear and forthcoming in explaining the financial reporting of this complex transaction. Therefore, we’ve introduced underlying performance metrics that primarily strip out the PPA-related pull-to-par effects from revenues in our core businesses and adjust for integration-related expenses across all performance segments. Regarding the pull-to-par effects in NCL, in the quarter we reclassified most of the positions that Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and Capital Release Unit historically accounted for on an accrual basis to fair value through P&L, as those positions in NCL are now held for sale. As a reminder, those positions gave rise to the 3.1 billion in future NCL pull-to-par revenues that we flagged last quarter. Given that NCL generates revenues in various ways, whether from early unwinds of positions and other disposals, mark-to-market on its fair value book, or from pull-to-par effects, we don’t distinguish among the various accounting classification types. Accordingly, in the quarter and going forward, all sources of NCL income, gain or loss will be treated as part of its underlying performance. sequentially to this estimated performance in the prior quarter. We’ll focus on sequential developments until the third quarter of 2024, when we’ll resume year-over-year commentary. Now, on to our planned changes. In the fourth quarter we will expand our Global Wealth Management asset flows disclosure and enhance comparability with US peers. We will report net new money plus dividends and interest, as well as disclose net new fee generating assets for the combined franchise. We intend to introduce a growth target for net new money, plus dividends and interest, when we present our integration KPIs and Additionally, starting from the first quarter of 2024, we expect to push out to our business divisions substantially all balance sheet and P&L items that were previously retained centrally in Group Items. The only exceptions will be for group items that are not directly attributable to divisional activities, including deferred tax assets, cash flow hedges, own credit and their associated P&L effects. Our business division equity attribution framework will also reflect these changes whereby the average levels of equity across the business divisions will more closely align to our current Group capital targets. billion increase from the second quarter as we delivered strong positive operating leverage with 0.6 billion higher revenues and 0.5 billion lower operating expenses. Additionally, CLE declined by 0.4 billion sequentially to 0.3 billion, which mainly related to Credit Suisse loans within P&C and NCL, which I cover later in more detail. By comparison, CLE in the second quarter of 0.7 billion included more than 0.5 billion of charges primarily related to the take-on recognition of ECL allowances on Credit Suisse’s lending portfolios. On a reported basis, the third quarter net loss was 785 million, as 526 million in tax expense arising in profitable entities, could not be offset by tax benefits from losses primarily generated by certain Credit Suisse subsidiaries. We expect our effective tax rate to remain elevated until we merge and restructure our most significant legal entities. After that time, the effective tax rate should gradually return to a level below 25%, absent the effects of any remeasurement of deferred tax assets. Group Items and gains in Non-Core and Legacy as the team accelerated the unwind of certain positions at attractive prices relative to book values. Revenues in Group Items increased sequentially primarily due to the reduction of around 450 million in centrally- held funding costs from the Credit Suisse-related liquidity measures that were repaid and returned in the middle of the third quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect an additional 100 million benefit from these actions. It is worth noting that the cost of replacement funding is being absorbed by the core businesses and is reflected in their sequential NII performance and guidance this quarter. Total revenues reached 11.7 billion, including 958 million that we’ve stripped out of underlying revenues. This amount consisted of 764 million in pull-to-par effects as well as 194 million of NII in our core businesses benefitting from the merger date elimination of the unrealized loss balance associated with Credit Suisse’s cash flow hedge program. The pull-to-par starting balance as of transaction close was 9.3 billion, excluding the 3.1 billion reclassification in NCL that I described earlier. Considering the pull-to-par accretion of 1.1 billion recognized since the merger date, including 0.8 billion this quarter, the remaining balance that will accrete into income over future quarters is expected to be around 8.2 billion. We expect the majority of this balance to accrete into income by the end of 2026, barring the impact of any early unwinds, with 500 million expected next quarter. We also expect to recognize around 900 million of additional NII in GWM and P&C relating to the eliminated cash flow hedge item I mentioned a few moments ago, with 150 million expected in 4Q. As a reminder, these effects are stripped out of our underlying revenues with about half being CET1 capital accretive. I would also point out that we continue to expect total pull-to-par revenues, including the reclassified NCL and post-2026 recognized portions, to broadly offset the costs to achieve the greater than 10 billion in gross savings we described last quarter. Having said this, like in the third quarter, we expect there will be timing mismatches in the recognition of these reported revenues and expenses, resulting in headwinds to our reported initiatives take effect, partially offset by reinvestments to help grow our core businesses. Progress on our restructuring actions led to 2 billion in integration-related expenses. Roughly half of these expenses was related to personnel costs, including severance payments, salaries of employees fully dedicated to integration matters, and the costs of retaining key personnel. The other half was related to non-personnel matters, including real estate impairments and depreciation, onerous contract charges, and consulting and legal fees. For the fourth quarter, we expect integration-related expenses in excess of 1 billion, although certain additional costs to achieve may arise if we see opportunities to accelerate savings. While we manage our integration to achieve overall cost reductions without specific headcount targets, I would note that our combined workforce fell by over 4 thousand in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to 13 thousand, or down 9% versus the workforce of both banks as of the end of 2022. Across our cost-savings initiatives, we’ve achieved around 3 billion to date in gross run-rate cost saves with further progress expected in the fourth quarter. a CET1 capital ratio of 14.4% mainly as we reduced RWA from the active run-down in our NCL portfolio, which offset reductions in our CET1 capital in the quarter. Our CET1 leverage ratio increased to 4.9% at the end of the quarter. As we previously guided, we expect to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% throughout the integration timeline, even if our reported performance over the coming quarters remains affected by the costs of winding down the NCL unit and the work needed to achieve cost synergies in our core businesses. During the quarter we issued 4.5 billion of US dollar TLAC attracting very strong demand, and pricing at pre- acquisition spreads, in a clear sign of fixed income investor confidence in our name. To further diversify our sources of funding, we successfully placed 3 billion in SEC-registered OpCo and, just after the quarter, 820 million Swiss francs in UBS’s inaugural Swiss covered bond issue, both attractively priced. Regarding liquidity, we maintained a prudent profile in the quarter with an LCR of nearly 200%, supported by 33 billion in total deposit inflows. I would note that these strong deposit inflows across Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking increased our overall deposit coverage ratio. Going forward, we expect to continue to operate with a prudent LCR to comply with the revisions to the Swiss Liquidity Ordinance that will come into effect on January 1, 2024. Regarding the Swiss National Bank’s recently announced changes to its minimum reserve requirements and sight deposit remuneration policies that take effect next month, we expect an annualized reduction of around 80 million Swiss francs to our NII, of which two-thirds will impact P&C and one-third GWM. continued strong momentum with 22 billion in net new money inflows across all regions. We saw particularly strong inflows in both APAC and EMEA, with 13 and 8 billion in net new money, respectively. Importantly, our Credit Suisse Wealth Management business attracted quarterly net inflows for the first time since the beginning of 2022. In the quarter, we also attracted 25 billion of net new deposits, including 17 billion from the Credit Suisse wealth side. These impressive flows are a true testament to the trust our clients continue to place in us. They also reflect the success of our clear and decisive win-back, retention, and client-acquisition actions, as well as intensified client engagement levels since the deal’s completion. We expect to further build on this momentum as the value proposition of the combined firm becomes more tangible to our clients. For instance, all of our clients now have access to the UBS House View from our CIO, and our wealth management product and solution offerings are being unified and aligned across the platforms. As mentioned, from next quarter we will report net new money plus dividends and interest, as well as net new fee generating assets for the combined franchise. In the third quarter, inflows based on this new definition were 39 billion, and net new fee generating assets in solely the UBS portion of our wealth business were 21 billion, with positive flows across all regions. Moving on to GWM’s P&L. Profit before tax was 1.1 billion, over 40% higher sequentially, driven by a reduction in costs and credit loss expenses with roughly flat revenues. Excluding the impact of CLE, which included a significant acquisition-related ECL charge last quarter, underlying profit before tax increased by around 20%, supported by lower underlying operating expenses. This quarter GWM revenues of 5.5 billion were broadly flat as increases in recurring fees were offset by a decline in NII. Combined net interest income was down 3%, on an underlying basis and excluding FX, reflecting continued deposit mix effects due to rotation into higher-yielding deposits, and ongoing deleveraging. This was partially offset by sequentially higher deposit balances that serve to close the funding gap in the business and strengthen the structural profile of our balance sheet. For the fourth quarter we expect a mid-single-digit percentage decline in NII mainly from continuing deposit mix shifts. Credit loss expenses in the quarter across GWM were 2 million. Operating expenses declined by 0.2 billion to 4.4 billion mainly driven by lower personnel expenses as reduced headcount levels, which we expect to continue sequentially, began to benefit our underlying earnings. Although it’s early days in terms of synergy realization in GWM, we are already seeing progress from our integration efforts. The division’s underlying cost/income ratio in the third quarter dropped by around 3 percentage points to 80%. Swiss francs, mainly driven by a decrease in credit loss expenses. Excluding CLE, P&C’s PBT was up slightly quarter on quarter. Revenues increased to 2.2 billion. With the announcement of the Swiss integration at the end of August, the business is highly focused on client engagement and deposit win-back. Early indications are encouraging as evidenced by the stability of the revenue line, the resilience of business volume and the commencement of deposit returns. Net interest income decreased by 4% despite the narrowing funding gap from net new deposit inflows, which mainly came from our corporate clients. A primary driver of the sequential decline this quarter was the additional cost of restoring the structural funding profile of the combined business to UBS’s NSFR standards. For the fourth quarter, we expect a low single digit percentage decline in NII mainly due to rotation to higher yielding deposits. Credit loss expense in the quarter was 154 million Swiss francs almost exclusively from two factors related to Credit Suisse’s Swiss Bank. First, we recognized CLE on [Edit: for credit-impaired] loans, mainly to corporate counterparties that were already impaired on the merger date and deteriorated further this quarter, as well as newly defaulted positions. Second, we moved to Stage 2, and provisioned in line with UBS’s coverage ratio standards, all loans including those as of the merger date on Credit Suisse’s watchlist as well as those lending exposures that experienced a significant increase in credit risk during the third quarter. Underlying operating expenses were roughly unchanged at 1.2 billion on lower personnel and litigation expenses, with the underlying cost/income ratio down quarter on quarter to 57%. revenues and lower costs. Revenues were slightly higher at 755 million, with increases in net management fees driven by market performance and FX, and higher performance fees from our hedge fund businesses. Operating expenses decreased to 599 million mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Net new money in the quarter was negative 1 billion driven by Credit Suisse outflows, which continue to taper since the acquisition, with inflows expected to gradually return from proactive client engagement. It’s worth noting that the UBS side of the business attracted net new money inflows this quarter in a challenging environment for asset managers. We saw strong demand for our Money Market, SMA and Real Estate & Private Markets solutions, partly offset by client asset allocation shifts away from China, Equities, and Hedge Funds in the current market dynamic. Net new money excluding money markets and associates was negative 8.3 billion. of the combined IB with standalone performance in the prior year’s third quarter. We will continue to offer year-over-year comparisons to standalone UBS IB performance in the quarters ahead while also providing commentary on sequential developments until the third quarter of 2024, as with the other business divisions. The operating loss of 116 million was a result of additional costs related to the retained portion of Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank, which was only partially offset by standalone profit before tax in UBS IB, as market conditions remain challenging for our business model. Underlying revenues, which exclude 251 million of pull-to-par accretion and other effects, declined 6% year- over-year to 1.9 billion amid muted client activity due to ongoing concerns around terminal interest rates and geopolitical events. Volatility across asset classes declined significantly from a year ago and global fee pools remained depressed. Against this backdrop, Global Banking revenues increased 36% with particular strength in leveraged capital markets and strong performance in EMEA. Advisory outperformed the global fee pool, and was further supported by revenues from the heritage Credit Suisse franchise. Global Markets revenues declined 15% from a very strong third quarter, reflecting lower revenues across macro products and equity derivatives. This was partly offset by growth in Financing supported by increased client balances. Overall, revenues generated from the retained portion of Credit Suisse’s investment bank were 113 [edit: 131] million this quarter, primarily in Advisory as well as Derivatives and Solutions. Operating expenses rose 27%, predominantly from additional personnel costs related to the retained portions of Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank, as well as higher technology costs and FX. As we manage the Investment Bank integration, we remain disciplined in our resource management. RWAs at 23% of the Group’s resources excluding NCL were roughly unchanged sequentially. Looking ahead, as the majority of the onboarding of our colleagues and positions to UBS IB systems is planned for completion by the end of the year, we expect revenues to ramp up over the course of 2024. Given this timing, in addition to current market conditions and seasonality, we expect continued pressure on our underlying profitability in the fourth quarter. underlying operating loss of 1 billion. Quarterly revenues of 350 million consisted mainly of gains from the early unwind of loan commitments while the portion of the NCL portfolio that remains on the accrual method of accounting was left broadly unchanged this quarter given recovery expectations on the underlying lending positions. Credit loss expense was 125 million. Additional provisions of 71 million reflect application of the same extended credit watchlist approach I described earlier in the context of P&C. We also saw 54 million of charges from Stage 3 and purchased credit-impaired loans that deteriorated further in the quarter. Underlying operating expenses reached 1.2 billion, split roughly equally between personnel and non-personnel costs. Integration-related expenses of 918 million consisted of onerous contract charges, real estate-related expenses, and personnel costs linked to headcount reductions and retention. For the fourth quarter, we expect the underlying cost base in Non-Core and Legacy to decrease further from additional staff reductions whose costs are directly housed within, or allocated to, NCL. As Sergio mentioned, in the quarter we took decisive actions to reduce RWAs. 5 of the total 6 billion reduction resulted from active de-risking of exposures across the array of NCL portfolios. LRD was reduced by 52 billion, including 15 billion resulting from lower HQLA requirements and 12 billion from the accounting reclassification of loan commitments from accrual to fair value. During the quarter, we completed the initial impact assessment on our operational risk RWA from the final Basel 3 standard, which comes into effect on January 1, 2025. Based on this initial study, we expect Group op risk RWA to remain broadly unchanged at the current level of 145 billion. We also determined on the basis of our impact assessment initial levels of RWA to apportion to each of our business divisions, including NCL. The 30 billion of operational risk RWA assigned to NCL this quarter is expected to diminish over time as a function of two considerations: the run-down of the NCL portfolio and the removal of certain legacy litigation matters given the lapse of time. On the basis of natural roll-off in both contexts, we expect operational risk RWA in NCL to decrease to around 14 billion by the end of 2026. As a reminder, we continue to expect a roughly 5% increase from day-1 effects in 2025 from other final Basel 3 considerations, mainly FRTB. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect many of the drivers of underlying profitability to continue to progress. In particular, we expect underlying operating expenses to decline sequentially as our core businesses realize incremental synergies, and NCL remains focused on actively running down its portfolio to release capital and accelerate cost saves. In addition to the NII expectations that I described earlier, transactional activity may be affected by seasonal factors as well as client sentiment in response to the geopolitical landscape. Despite these elements, we are executing on our integration plans at pace and remain on track to achieve our goals of around a 15% return on CET1 capital and a cost/income ratio of less than 70% by the end of 2026.

3Q24,Group Chief Financial Officer,Including analyst Q&A session,['including analyst q&a session']
3Q24,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Our strong financial performance in the quarter, with a net profit of 1.4 billion and an underlying PBT of 2.4 diversified business model and global scale. It also represents continued progress on the integration. This brings us two important benefits. First, it increases our confidence level in achieving our short- and medium-term financial targets. Second, it allows us to offer the full range of services of the combined bank, and to stay even closer to clients. We are better positioned than ever to help them navigate a market background that, while constructive, still exhibits periods of high volatility and dislocation. Our commitment to serving clients is reflected in a 9% year-on-year increase in underlying revenues, with notable strength in the Americas and APAC. Invested assets across the Group increased by 15% year-on-year to 6.2 trillion. This shows that our wealth and asset management clients continue to value the capabilities we provide across our advice platform and the way in which we consistently innovate to meet their needs. One excellent example is the positive client and General Partner reaction to the launch of our Unified Global Alternatives unit, which has created a top-5 player in Alternatives. In Switzerland, while we faced the expected headwinds on Net Interest Income, we continued to deliver on our commitment to acting as a safe and reliable provider of credit to the economy, with around 35 billion Swiss francs of loans granted or renewed in the quarter. Within the Investment Bank, our investments in Global Markets supported robust performance in Equities, notably in the Americas. And in Global Banking, we maintained our momentum in Advisory as we outperformed the global M&A fee pools for the third consecutive quarter. As importantly, our M&A pipeline continues to build. Turning back to the integration. The finalization of our preparation work during the quarter allowed us, in the last two weeks of October, to successfully achieve another milestone. We moved all of the client accounts and data in Luxembourg and Hong Kong onto UBS platforms. The next significant milestones for 2024 are the client account migrations in Singapore and Japan, expected by year-end. We will then kick-off the next phase of Swiss migrations in the second quarter of 2025, positioning us well to enhance the client experience and unlock further cost reductions towards the end of 2025 and into 2026. In Non-core and Legacy, we continue to simplify our operations through book closures and the decommissioning of applications. This has supported the significant year-to-date reductions in costs. And thanks to our active wind-down efforts, the natural runoff profile of the remaining positions is already in line with our 2026 risk-weighted asset ambition. At the same time, we remain focused on identifying opportunities to further improve the rundown profile, but will continue to do so without compromising economic value creation. The overall disciplined progress on the integration, including the completion of the legal entity mergers, has significantly mitigated the execution risk of the Credit Suisse acquisition. This, combined with the strong performance of our businesses, has allowed us to generate capital well ahead of our plan and guidance. As we prudently assess future capital requirements, business plans and profitability for the coming years, we returns to shareholders. Consequently, we have voluntarily accelerated the phase-out of the remaining transitional capital adjustments agreed with our regulator, which we had disclosed upon the closing of the acquisition. This brings our CET1 capital ratio to 14.3%, more in line with our guidance while maintaining a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all seasons. This buffer was never considered for distribution and its removal has no impact on our ability to execute on the ongoing 2024 share buyback, nor on our medium-term ambitions for dividends and buybacks. As already communicated, we will provide more detail on our 2025 capital return plans, including the continued Our ambition for 2026 capital returns to exceed pre-acquisition levels is unchanged, subject to our assessment of any proposed requirements from Switzerland’s ongoing review of its capital regime. I want to emphasize that our focus extends beyond meeting the current needs of our clients, executing on the integration and delivering on our short-term plans. We are also preparing for the future by continuing to invest in our people, products and capabilities to strengthen our client offerings and position our businesses for long-term growth. This includes investing in our industry-leading cloud infrastructure as well as our expertise in artificial intelligence and automation. This will accelerate Generative AI adoption, increasing efficiency and effectiveness. One example of the many ways we are leveraging AI is through Microsoft Copilot. With 50,000 licenses being rolled out between now and the end of the first quarter, we are implementing the largest deployment of Copilot within the global financial services industry to date. Another example is Red, a proprietary new AI assistant that provides 20,000 employees in Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Singapore with easy access to UBS product information and investment research. In the Investment Bank, we are piloting a proprietary AI algorithm that researches and compiles potential merger and acquisition buy-side targets. In these, and the many other AI deployments that are underway across the entire firm, we are focused on responsible AI as we provide our people with tools that will help them better manage their businesses. Even as new technology is changing the way we work, our people will remain the most important driver of our success. is an important testament to the progress we have made on the integration. 84% say they are proud to work for UBS, and 83% would recommend UBS as an employer – both well above industry benchmarks. We have achieved a lot over the last 18 months as we are building a stronger and even safer version of UBS that all of our key stakeholders can be proud of. But there is no room for complacency. We are just about halfway to restoring pre-acquisition levels of profits and returns on capital and the journey won’t be a straight line. In the short-term, in addition to seasonality, ongoing global macroeconomic developments, geopolitical conflicts and the upcoming US elections create uncertainties that are likely to affect investor behavior. We continue to help clients navigate this environment, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets as we position UBS for long-term, sustainable growth and remain a pillar of economic support in the communities where we live and work. With that, I hand over to Todd.",['thank you sarah good morning everyone strong financial performance quarter net profit 14 billion underlying pbt 24 diversified business model global scale also

3Q24,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you Sergio, and good morning everyone. Also, starting today, I compare our performance to the prior-year quarter since we now have fully comparable year-over-year information for the first time since the Credit Suisse acquisition last year. I continue to offer sequential insights on balance sheet, net interest income developments, and our progress towards achieving our gross cost save targets by the end of 2026. operating leverage improvement year-over-year, contributing to a return on CET1 capital of 9.4%. Total revenues rose by 9% to 11.7 billion driven by momentum in our asset gathering businesses and Investment Bank. At the same time, operating expenses declined by 4% to 9.2 billion as we continued to execute on our integration and efficiency plans. and a return on CET1 capital of 9.2%. The net profit for the quarter was 1.4 billion with an EPS of 43 cents. lower costs and CLE. On a reported basis, PBT was 1.9 billion including 0.7 billion of purchase price allocation adjustments in our core businesses, and integration-related expenses of 1.1 billion. Our tax expense in the third quarter was 502 million, representing an effective rate of 26%. For the fourth quarter, we expect additional revenues from purchase price allocation adjustments of 0.5 billion, integration-related expenses of 1.2 billion and an effective tax rate of around 35%. Operating expenses increased by 2% quarter-on-quarter, and were flat excluding the effects of US dollar softness against the Swiss franc and pound Sterling, in which we incur substantial personnel costs. When also excluding increased variable compensation linked to revenues and lower litigation reserve releases, operating expenses reduced by around 200 million sequentially, or 2%. This was supported by a lower, overall employee count, which fell sequentially by another fourteen hundred, or 1%, to below 132,000. The total staff count is down 25 thousand, or 16%, from our 2022 baseline. Our underlying cost-income ratio dropped by two points sequentially to 78.5% and has improved by over 10 points compared to the same quarter last year. This performance highlights the substantial progress to date and outlines the path forward to reach our target ratio of under 70% by the end of 2026. As in prior years, we expect in 4Q a modest sequential uptick in our operating expenses for select non-personnel items, including the UK bank levy and regional marketing spend. putting us past the halfway mark towards our 13 billion goal. As expected, the pace of saves moderately slowed this quarter as we continued the intensive work necessary to effectively dismantle the infrastructure of a former G-SIB. In particular, we completed preparation of the client account and platform migrations in our Asian wealth franchise and continued readiness efforts relating to our Swiss booking center - by far our largest - that are planned for next year. This phase of the integration requires fully staffed teams across regions to minimize client disruption and maintain operational efficiency. The comparatively smaller saves this quarter are a reflection of these concerted efforts along with higher variable compensation, FX headwinds and more moderate cost progress in NCL after a year of very strong sequential achievements. As we continue our client account and platform migration work across our divisions and regions in the months ahead, we estimate sequential cost saves to be similarly sized. We expect the pace to pick-up again once this critical integration phase is complete and we can then fully benefit from decommissioning software, hardware and data centers, and by unlocking further staff capacity. By the end of this year, we plan to have delivered around 7.5 billion in annualized gross cost saves versus our 2022 baseline and cumulative integration-related expenses of around 9 billion. 14.3%, slightly above our guidance of around 14%. out of the PPA-related transitional capital adjustment, which led to a 65-basis point reduction in our CET1 capital ratio. Without this voluntary acceleration, the ratio at the end of the quarter would have been 14.9%. As many of you will remember from last year, the acquisition accounting standard required us to fair value all of Credit Suisse’s assets and liabilities at closing. This purchase price allocation process also resulted in fair value discounts applied to select Credit Suisse positions, such as fixed-rate Swiss mortgages and certain term note liabilities, which were driven solely by interest-rate and own credit effects. Accordingly, these fair value adjustments, totaling to negative 5 billion net of tax effects, were expected to fully reverse into income, or pull-to-par, over time. Given the temporary nature of these adjustments, we agreed with our regulator at closing to amortize the resulting capital reduction on a linear basis over a 4-year period. This shielded our capital from significant accounting-driven volatility, at least during the first phase of the integration process. Our decision this quarter to accelerate the phase-out of the residual balance of 3.4 billion reflects the significant progress we’ve made to date across our integration agenda, including the successful merger of the two parent banks last quarter. This decision also underscores our confidence moving forward. Moreover, by accelerating the phase-out of the transitional capital adjustment on the aforementioned positions, the remaining PPA discount, like all other pull-to-par revenues, will now fully accrete into our capital in future Specifically, we expect to recognize total pull-to-par revenues of 6.4 billion over the next several years, benefitting our net profit, equity, and CET1 capital. Within this, 80% is set to accrete back by the end of 2028, of which 3 and a half billion by the end of 2026. Notably, the requirement to fair value the positions subject to the transitional capital adjustment had no bearing on the Credit Suisse parent bank or its standalone capital position. Hence, it’s important to emphasize that our decision this quarter is equally neutral to the regulatory capital position of UBS AG, now that the two parent banks have merged. We expect UBS AG’s standalone, fully-applied CET1 capital ratio to be a strong 13.3% when we publish our report next week. A brief update on Basel 3 finalization as we continue to assess the effects of the Swiss implementation on RWA impact will be a low single digit percentage of total Group RWA. This is revised down from our prior guidance of around 5%, and is now expected to reduce our CET1 capital ratio by around 30 basis points upon implementation next year. I offer a more comprehensive picture of our balance sheet and the structural drivers that contribute to making it a balance sheet for all seasons. As of the end of the third quarter our balance sheet consisted of 1.6 trillion in total assets, with around 40% in loan balances. While we continue to optimize the risk profile of exposures inherited with the acquisition of Credit Suisse, our lending book continues to reflect high credit quality and disciplined risk management. More than 80% of our loan portfolio consists of mortgages, with an average LTV of around 50%, and fully collateralized Lombard loans. This quarter our credit-impaired exposure as a percentage of our loan book was just 73 basis points, and our cost of risk was only 8 basis points. Assets held at fair value were 494 billion, or around 30% of the total balance sheet. Notably, Level 3 assets were 16 billion and accounted for less than 1% of our total assets. Turning to the liability side. Our operations this quarter were funded with 776 billion of deposits and almost 370 billion of well-diversified wholesale funding, spread across currencies and tenors. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at quarter end was 79%. Throughout the year, we have diligently executed on our funding plan, already having completed our issuances for 2024 and prefunded some of our 2025 AT1 build. Finally, tangible equity in the quarter increased by 3.6 billion to 80 billion, mainly driven by quarterly net profits and other comprehensive income of 2.5 billion. This was partly offset by a net reduction of 0.5 billion for Treasury shares repurchased as part of our share buyback program. Our tangible book value was 25 dollars and 10 cents per share, reflecting a sequential increase of 5%. Overall, we continue to operate with a highly fortified and resilient balance sheet with total loss absorbing capacity of 195 billion, a net stable funding ratio of 127% and an LCR of 199%. GWM’s pre-tax profit was 1.3 billion, an increase of 30% with strong positive jaws as revenue growth outpaced expenses by 4 percentage points. Our performance is showcasing the enduring competitive strengths of our wealth franchise. Enhanced by the Credit Suisse acquisition, our global scale, diversified model, and cross-divisional capabilities uniquely position us to capture wallet and seize growth opportunities. The industry trends we see accelerating include legacy and longevity-based planning needs, geographic wealth migration, and active management among the world’s wealthiest investors to diversify portfolios and manage risks. These secular growth dynamics play right to our strengths. This quarter, within an active market environment characterized by higher volatility and continuing concerns around geopolitical developments, our clients benefitted from our CIO’s call to remain invested and to position their portfolios to take advantage of the current market backdrop. This further strengthened our clients’ trust in our advice and capabilities, and contributed to strong revenue growth in every region. last year’s pre-tax profits on a revenue improvement of 13%. Also in the Americas, where invested assets surpassed the 2 trillion mark, our performance showed notable progress. PBT grew by 11% year-on-year and by over 30% sequentially, translating into a pre-tax margin of 12%. In the quarter we delivered 25 billion in net new assets with positive flows across all regions. With net new assets of nearly 80 billion year-to-date, we remain on track to deliver on our 100 billion NNA ambition for 2024. Once again, we attracted strong net new assets while continuing to absorb integration-related headwinds, including the anticipated roll-off of a portion of the fixed term deposits associated with last year’s win-back campaign, our ongoing work to optimize balance sheet usage and enhance revenue margins, and the residual tail of client advisors leaving the Credit Suisse platform. Of the 60 billion in deposit volumes maturing in the quarter, we retained 85% on our platform, including converting 20% into more profitable mandates, structured products and other liquidity solutions. Managing this roll-off will remain a short-term priority for us as we expect elevated maturing deposit volumes over the next two quarters. Additionally, by remaining focused on improving the efficiency of our financial resources and increasing profitability on sub-hurdle relationships, our balance sheet optimization efforts have supported incremental progress in our revenue over RWA margin, bringing it to over 23%, a 3 percentage point increase from a year ago when we started this work. Net new fee-generating assets were 15 billion, reflecting strong discretionary mandate sales in all regions with disciplined pricing supporting stable margins sequentially. Now, onto GWM’s financials. Total revenues increased by 7% with higher recurring net fee income and double-digit growth in transactional revenues, more than offsetting NII headwinds. As I’ve highlighted in the past, a lower interest rate environment is expected to spur client demand for more advisory solutions, including structured products and alternative investments, as clients seek to rebalance their cash exposures in search for yield. We also expect clients to re- engage in lending activities helping to offset some of the NII headwinds. Recurring net fee income increased by 9% to 3.2 billion as our invested assets grew to 4.3 trillion, up 16% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by market growth, FX and net new asset inflows. Mandate penetration increased to 38%, up 2 points from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting the value our clients see in our advice and solutions supporting their investment objectives. Transaction-based revenues were 1.1 billion, up 19%, with strong momentum across all regions supported by the initial reduction in US policy rates. Combined with the announcement of economic stimulus in China, this made for a constructive trading environment for our clients. In addition, the successful collaboration between GWM and the IB, and our investments in AI-led sales support capabilities, allowed us to capture transactional volumes across our expanding product shelf. We saw impressive growth in structured and cash products, and in alternatives. This continues to be especially notable in APAC and the Americas, where transactional revenues were up 25% and 23% year-on-year, respectively, and both up sequentially vs a strong 2Q. We see this momentum continuing into the fourth quarter, while noting transactional activity typically decreases as we approach year-end. Net interest income at 1.6 billion was broadly flat sequentially as reinvestment income from longer duration in our replication portfolios offset expected headwinds from mix shifts. In the fourth quarter, with 50 basis points of further US dollar rate cuts priced-in, we expect a sequential mid- single digit percentage drop in NII. This is expected to be driven mainly by headwinds to deposit revenues from lower rates, while our deposit balances, as mentioned, reflect conversion of fixed-term deposits, in part, into non-deposit solutions. Also, as mentioned last quarter, towards the end of the year, we plan to adjust the sweep deposit rates in our US advisory accounts. The effect of this change on our NII is expected to be minimal in the fourth quarter. Moreover, lower US dollar rate assumptions also reduce the modeled impact of sweep deposit rate changes on net interest income in 2025, and likewise would be expected to improve last quarter’s guidance of negative 50 million of PBT annually. Across GWM, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to initially expect net interest income to trough around planning process, we intend to offer more developed insight into our 2025 expectations for GWM NII. Operating expenses increased by 3% compared to last year and 1% sequentially. Excluding compensation- related and currency translation effects, underlying operating expenses dropped by 4% compared to the second quarter. As highlighted previously, the ongoing client account and platform migration work is expected to be a significant driver of cost reductions in GWM by the middle of 2025 and into 2026. P&C delivered third quarter pre-tax profit of 659 million Swiss francs, down 7%. Revenues decreased by a similar level, mainly as NII dropped by 11% as the prior-year quarter featured substantially higher Swiss franc interest rates. Recurring net fee income increased by 5% on higher custody assets, while transaction-based revenues were down 5% mainly from lower corporate activity, including in trade finance, partly offset by higher card fees. NII decreased by 2% sequentially, mainly driven by the effect of the SNB’s second 25 basis point interest rate cut in June and partly offset by the benefits of our balance sheet optimization efforts, which remain key to building back returns to pre-acquisition levels. This work, which continues to contribute to improved revenues on capital deployed and fixing the funding gap inherited from Credit Suisse, came at the expense of net new lending outflows of 5.6 billion Swiss francs this quarter. I would highlight that P&C’s contribution to our commitment in Switzerland to maintain a loan book of 350 billion Swiss francs was evidenced by around 25 billion in loans granted or renewed during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect NII to tick down sequentially by a low single-digit percentage both in Swiss francs and US dollars as the effects of the SNB’s third 25 basis-point rate cut in September are expected to more than offset improved lending revenues from our re-pricing efforts and lower funding costs. Considering competitive dynamics in Switzerland as well as the measured pace of accommodation in the Swiss central bank’s monetary policy, our objective is to protect client deposit balances. Hence, our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects only a slight increase in deposit beta. As mentioned last quarter, with Swiss franc interest rates stabilizing by mid next year based on current implied forwards, we continue to expect net interest income in P&C to trough shortly thereafter. We will offer additional insights into our 2025 expectations for P&C NII next quarter. Credit loss expense was 71 million, driven by several positions in our corporate loan book, mainly on the Credit Suisse platform. For the foreseeable future, we expect CLE to remain at broadly similar levels given the persistent relative strength of the Swiss franc and some economic softness in the main Swiss export markets, contributing to an already muted domestic economic outlook. Operating expenses in P&C were broadly flat year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter. asset management franchise is making visible progress in advancing its strategy of offering differentiated and tailored client solutions at scale. Complementing this is a high level of focus on streamlining the operational backbone of the division as well as exiting non-strategic businesses. sale of our Brazilian real estate fund management business. Excluding these gains, Asset Management’s revenues were up by 3% year-on-year. Net management fees were broadly flat as higher average invested assets and the effect of a revaluation of a real estate fund offset ongoing margin compression from clients rotating into lower-margin products. Performance fees were 46 million compared to 18 million in the prior year quarter driven by higher revenues in our hedge fund businesses and Fixed Income. Net new money in the quarter was positive 2 billion, with strong inflows in Money Markets and positive contribution from our China JVs, more than offsetting outflows in Equities. Operating expenses were 4% higher as cost reductions from lower headcount were more than offset by higher personnel and litigation expenses. The IB continued to build revenue momentum leveraging the investments in teams and capabilities acquired Revenues increased by 29% to 2.5 billion with Global Markets posting its best third quarter on record and supported by solid performance in Global Banking. Banking revenues increased by 21% to 555 million as we leveraged the increased breadth of our franchise and solidified growth achieved over the last several quarters. Our investments in talent and integrated coverage teams are paying off as we have gained meaningful market share in a number of key sectors. Regionally, APAC delivered its best third quarter on record in M&A, more than doubling total revenues from the prior year quarter, while Banking revenues in the US were up by around 20%. In Advisory we delivered top line growth of 13% and further market share gains in M&A. Capital Markets revenues rose by 28% with increases across all product groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength of our pipeline, which should support our performance into 2025. We also maintain a top-ten ranking across the street in announced M&A volume. Revenues in Markets increased by 31% to 1.9 billion, driven by client activity and the strength of our expanded franchise. We saw increases across all regions, and notably in the Americas, where revenues were up by around 60%. Equities revenues were up by 33%, supported by higher constructive volatility. Our Equity Derivatives and Cash Equities businesses each delivered their best third quarter on record. FRC was up by 26% with double-digit growth in FX and rates, as we benefitted from increased client activity, albeit against a softer comparative quarter a year ago. Operating expenses rose by 2%, and were broadly flat excluding currency effects. Non-core and Legacy’s pre-tax loss in the quarter was 333 million, with 262 million in revenues, primarily from position exit gains in securitized products partly offset by net losses in macro. Excluding litigation, operating expenses were down by over 40% year-on-year, and up 1% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, we expect NCL to generate a pre-tax loss broadly in line with the guidance we provided with our 2Q24 earnings. quarter last year, NCL has freed up almost 6 billion of capital by reducing its RWA by around half and its LRD by two thirds. It also halved its cost base in that time. This progress to-date puts us nearly a year ahead of our de-risking schedule, including closing over 50% of the 14 thousand books we started with. By the end of 2026 we aim to have less than 5% remaining. As the chart illustrates, solely by letting the portfolio naturally run-off, we would already broadly meet our current ambition to reduce NCL to 5% of Group RWA by 2026. This impressive result is testament to the skillful work delivered by the NCL team over the past 5 quarters. After completing our planning process, we’ll provide an update to our NCL ambitions through 2026 with our fourth Recapping the quarter, we showcased the strengths and long-term strategic advantages of our franchise by building on positive client momentum and delivering strong underlying profitability. We continued to make impressive progress in integrating Credit Suisse as we’ve successfully embarked on the next critical phase of our integration journey.

4Q23,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a defining year for UBS as we acquired Credit Suisse in one of the largest transactions in banking history, setting a new long-term trajectory for our franchise. It was also an intense year that required exceptional focus from all of our colleagues during periods of significant change and uncertainty. We stayed close to our clients, helping them manage a rapidly evolving geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop, as well as the turmoil that occurred in the financial system last March. The strength and stability of UBS provides is a direct result of our decade-long sustainable strategy, an unwavering commitment to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons, and a focus on risk and capital efficiency. For these reasons, clients reward UBS with their extended trust and confidence during periods of volatility and market uncertainty. And it allowed UBS to credibly step in and stabilize the Swiss, and wider, financial system by taking over Credit Suisse. We have acquired an enterprise that has suffered from many years of unsustainable capital allocation and under-investment in its businesses and control framework. This resulted in cost and capital inefficiencies, significant losses and, ultimately, substantial franchise erosion. However, the acquisition accelerates our strategic priorities by providing UBS with a complementary client base, stronger regional presence, more products and services, as well as many talented people. This gives us great confidence in our ability to meet our ambitions and deliver long-term growth and consistently higher returns. We made great progress on our plans in 2023. We successfully won back, retained and grew client assets while beginning the restructuring phase. We have also substantially reduced funding costs and run down non-core books. In our first full quarter as a combined firm, we stabilized Credit Suisse’s client franchises and achieved underlying profitability. This permitted us to pay down the extraordinary liquidity support and voluntarily terminate the loss-protection agreement guaranteed by the Swiss government. We also provided important clarity for all of our stakeholders as we finalized our target operating model. Notably, we established the perimeter for Non-Core and Legacy and moved forward with fully integrating our Swiss domestic operations. Our progress continued in the fourth quarter. We maintained momentum with our clients, with 22 billion in net new assets in GWM, bringing our total to 77 billion since the closing of the acquisition. In the quarter, we also cut another 1 billion in exit-rate gross costs as we move forward on our restructuring plans. Nearly 80% of Non Core and Legacy’s 12 billion decline in risk weighted assets in the second half was driven by our active wind-downs. We achieved all of this while maintaining our capital strength. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 14.5%, helping us to build capacity for higher capital returns while, at the same time, preparing to absorb integration charges and tax inefficiencies. A great - and often overlooked - measure of the Group’s resilience and self- sufficiency is our total loss-absorbing capacity, which now stands at 200 billion. Given the ongoing debate following the events of last March, this is particularly relevant to me. Lastly, let me highlight some things I am especially proud of, and which I believe is the essential driver of what will make this successful journey a great story. Our people have embraced both our culture and the opportunity ahead while collaborating on the integration. This will allow us to continue to serve clients and fulfil our growth initiatives.

4Q23,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you Sergio and good morning, everyone. You’ll recall that with our third quarter earnings, we introduced underlying performance metrics that strip out items that we don’t consider to be representative of underlying performance - primarily pull-to-par effects from the purchase price allocation process and integration-related expenses. In this respect, when assessing the progress we are making in our underlying performance, it is important to remember that our underlying operating expense baseline is the combination of the cost stacks of two globally, systemically important banks, such that our underlying costs in absolute terms remain elevated, and will for some time. This quarter, our underlying performance also excludes a material loss relating to our ownership interest in SIX Group. In my remarks, I will refer to these underlying numbers in US dollars and compare them to our performance last quarter, unless stated otherwise. from the third quarter, mainly driven by lower client activity and billable invested assets, as well as the UK bank levy and a US FDIC special assessment relating to last year’s US bank closures. Credit loss expenses were 136 million this quarter, mainly relating to P&C and the IB. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter net loss was 279 million, including a net tax benefit of 473 million, primarily resulting from a revaluation of our deferred tax assets as we completed our business planning process. As we continue to execute on our integration plans at pace and benefit from seasonally higher client activity, we expect substantial improvement in our first quarter reported net profit as compared to 4Q23. recurring and net management fees on a reduced, average invested asset base, lower fair value and exit gains in Non-Core and Legacy, as well as decreased transaction-based revenues across the divisions. Total reported revenues reached 10.9 billion, which included 944 million from pull-to-par and related effects in our core businesses. As mentioned, we also marked down our investment in SIX by 508 million to reflect the lower valuation of SIX’s stake in Worldline as well as SIX’s goodwill impairment relating to its ownership of the Spanish stock exchange. was reduced by around 4 thousand in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to 17 thousand, or down 11% versus the workforce of both banks at the end of 2022. These reductions contributed to our achievement of around 4 billion in gross run-rate cost saves exiting 2023 when compared to the 2022 baseline. Integration-related expenses were 1.8 billion, of which 794 million were personnel-related, including a pension benefit equalization charge of 245 million, and 604 million from real-estate and technology asset expenses. The pension charge did not affect CET1 capital as we recorded an offsetting gain in OCI. On a reported basis, including integration-related expenses, opex was 11.5 billion. mentioned last quarter, to align with peers, we now report net new money, plus dividends and interest, under the label of net new assets. We will also continue to disclose net new fee-generating assets, now for the combined franchise. We saw continued momentum in flows with 22 billion in net new assets, with particularly strong performance in APAC and the Americas. We also attracted 16 billion of net new deposits, with net inflows across both the UBS and Credit Suisse platforms, and including deposit inflows in the Americas for the first time since 2021. Despite the significant outflows at Credit Suisse in the first half of 2023, we generated around 54 billion of net new assets across the platforms for the full year, as we stabilized Credit Suisse and grew our combined franchise. Moving on to GWM’s P&L, profit before tax was 778 million, down 31% sequentially, driven by lower revenues and higher operating expenses. Credit provisions were a 7 million release in the quarter. Revenues of 5.4 billion were 3% lower with decreases in NII and recurring fees, and with transactional revenues overall impacted by lower client activity, but nonetheless strong on the UBS platform, up 10% year-over-year. Net interest income was down 2%, reflecting tapering deposit mix effects in the US, and ongoing deleveraging, partially offset by stronger deposit revenues on higher volumes. Recurring fees were down 2%, reflecting a lower average billing base. Operating expenses increased 5% to 4.6 billion, mainly due to the FDIC special assessment, litigation provisions and higher marketing and branding costs. Important to note is that we continue to see progress in taking down costs across GWM where we are integrating Credit Suisse. Specifically, in the parts of our wealth business outside the US, underlying operating expenses ex litigation and FX ticked down in the quarter and have dropped 8% compared to 2Q23 on an exit rate basis. In the US, where a year-over-year comparison is more relevant, costs were down 2% ex financial advisor compensation, the FDIC assessment and litigation. decision at the end of August, P&C generated a pre-tax profit of 794 million Swiss francs, up 3%, with lower revenues more than offset by lower operating expenses and credit charges. As I highlighted last quarter in connection with September trends, the focus on win-back and coverage alignment across both Swiss platforms continues to contribute to strong financial performance for P&C, including over 7 billion of net new deposit inflows in the fourth quarter and revenue resiliency. Net interest income was down 1%, as the benefits from deposit inflows and higher rates were slightly more than offset by the effects of lower loan volumes and clients shifting deposits into higher-yielding products. We expect NII for P&C and GWM combined, and in US dollar terms, to be roughly flat sequentially in the first quarter, with higher rates broadly offsetting the residual effects of deposit mix shifts and the initial impact of financial resource optimization, which Sergio and I will cover in greater detail shortly. Non-NII revenues in P&C declined by 11%, mostly driven by transaction-based income, including lower client activity, particularly in Corporate and Institutional Clients. Credit loss expenses in the quarter were 72 million Swiss francs, mainly related to defaults across several names on the Credit Suisse platform, and from aligning provisioning approaches pertaining to Credit Suisse’s watchlist credits. I would also note that PPA adjustments have reduced the level of CLE this quarter. While we have now substantially aligned provisions and methodologies across both books, we could see a continuation of the elevated levels of CLE in P&C for the foreseeable future given Credit Suisse’s higher historical credit risk profile and the current economic environment. Opex dropped by 5% on lower personnel and real estate expenses. performance fees and from gains on disposals that closed in the quarter, notably our joint venture in South Korea. Net management fees were down slightly on lower average invested assets in the quarter. Opex increased 4% to 625 million, mainly from higher personnel expenses and litigation charges. Net new money in the quarter was negative 12 billion, predominantly from two large outflows in indexed equities, while we continue to see client demand for SMA and Private Markets capabilities. of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, we continue to consider year-over-year comparisons to be instructive in describing the performance of the business, in particular regarding revenues. The operating loss of 280 million primarily reflects 34% higher costs, mainly personnel and technology related, while revenues from onboarded Credit Suisse staff are only beginning to build. Underlying revenues, not including 277 million of pull-to-par accretion and other effects, increased 11% year- over-year to 1.9 billion. Global Banking revenues increased 69% with fee-pool outperformance across key products and across all regions and particular strength in leveraged and debt capital markets, as well as strong performance in the Americas. Global Markets revenues were down 4%, reflecting declines in Rates and FX, more than offsetting growth in equity derivatives, cash equities and financing, the latter of which topped off its best full year on record. I should highlight that cash equities gained global market share over the course of 2023. During the fourth quarter we completed the Credit Suisse banking team integration, which is already showing in our M&A pipeline. Similarly, for Markets, we expect to substantially complete onboarding of the team and the majority of its trading positions to UBS infrastructure by the end of 1Q. With improving market activity, a growing banking pipeline and advanced progress on integration, we expect the IB to return to profitability in the first quarter. reduced RWA by 6 billion, with three quarters of the decrease from active wind-down. LRD dropped by 19 billion, and is down one-third since 2Q23. Revenues were 162 million in the quarter. As in 3Q, on average we exited positions at or above our marks. Credit loss expenses were negligible in the quarter now that the majority of the NCL book is accounted for at fair value. Notably, underlying opex was down 9% as we continue to reduce headcount. Integration-related expenses of 749 million consisted mainly of real estate impairment charges. comfortably above our guidance and regulatory requirements. The CET1 capital ratio improved 10 basis points to 14.5% as the negative impacts from the reported loss and dividend accruals were more than offset by RWA reductions ex-FX and a net write-up of temporary difference DTAs. Both CET1 capital and RWAs were significantly impacted by currency translation, which broadly offset each other in the CET1 capital ratio. Currency translation effects also accounted for more of the 80 billion increase in LRD this quarter. We also retained higher HQLA to underpin increased deposit balances and to address the new Swiss liquidity requirements that just took effect. I will return shortly to comment on how we’re thinking more broadly about capital, liquidity and funding, as we work towards delivering our financial ambitions by the end of 2026. Let me also briefly touch on a few reporting changes we are implementing from the first quarter of 2024. First, we are transferring the high net-worth client segment from the Swiss Bank of Credit Suisse to Global Wealth Management to best meet our clients’ needs and align to UBS’s divisional structure. These clients represent an estimated 60 billion in invested assets and 550 million in annual revenues. Second, and as I highlighted last quarter, we are pushing out to our business divisions substantially all balance sheet, equity and P&L items that were previously retained centrally.

4Q23,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Todd. For more than a decade, UBS has stood out among its G-SIB peers for its favorable mix of businesses and unique model. Our global asset gathering operation and Swiss universal bank are at the core of our strategy, and they are complemented by our capital-light Investment Bank. Since 2012, our ambition to be the world’s leading global wealth manager has served us well, allowing us to generate over 50 billion in capital for shareholders through the end of 2022, while also investing in sustainable, long-term growth. The Credit Suisse deal accelerates our strategy. We are the only truly global wealth manager with nearly 4 trillion in invested assets across a client franchise that would be nearly impossible to replicate. Globally, GWM clients benefit from our unparalleled advice, products and services. We are the number one wealth manager in Switzerland, EMEA and APAC. In these regions, our invested assets have grown by at least 50% due to the acquisition – the equivalent of a decade of growth. In the Americas, we are a top player in the U.S. and are number one in Latin America. The acquisition is also reinforcing our position as the number one universal bank in Switzerland. This is not a function of our size or market share, but the clear result of the value we bring to our clients through our one- firm approach, expertise and global reach that is particularly important to our large corporate and Small and Medium Enterprise clients. With 1.6 trillion in invested assets, Asset Management has improved our competitiveness globally and expanded our presence in growth markets. We have strengthened the value provided to clients through complementary products across key asset classes. In the Investment Bank, we are reinforcing our competitive position with our key clients. We will continue to build durable and profitable market share in the areas that differentiate UBS for our clients, while now deploying a smaller proportion of the Group’s financial resources, compared to pre-acquisition levels. We finished 2023 with strong momentum in terms of our integration timeline. While we have full confidence in our ability to fulfil our goals, we are not complacent about the magnitude and complexity of the task ahead. Given the evident structural issues with Credit Suisse’s business model and lack of profitability, there is a significant amount of restructuring and optimization that must take place over the next three years before we can harvest the full benefits of the combination. As we previously communicated, during 2024 and 2025, we will incur substantial integration-related expenses as we materially restructure and remove duplication across our operations. The Non-core and Legacy portfolio years, Credit Suisse’s core businesses will also continue to require balance sheet optimization. While we will sacrifice some reported profitability and growth in the short-term, we are convinced this will improve the quality of our long-term growth trajectory, and bring greater cost and capital efficiency. As a result, we are reiterating our targets to realize an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and cost/income ratio of less than 70% as we exit 2026. As I’ve said before, 2024 is a pivotal year for UBS. We are taking a staged approach in our execution plan to minimize the risk of disruption for clients and employees. With over six thousand deliverables over the next merger of our parent banks and establish a single US IHC by the end of the first half of the year. The merger of our Swiss entities should occur before the end of the third quarter. Completing these key milestones will allow us to realize the associated cost, capital and funding benefits. These significant legal-entity mergers are a pre- requisite for the first wave of client migrations and will allow us to begin streamlining and decommissioning legacy platforms in the second half of 2024. This process will continue into 2025 before we begin the transition towards our target state in 2026. Again, I’m sure we all appreciate the significant costs associated with running and combining two G-SIBs, including one that is still structurally unprofitable. This is why a pure integration cost journey is not enough. We also need to deeply restructure to get to an appropriate cost base. Therefore, the realization of our integration plans and the run-down of the Non-core and Legacy portfolio is expected to result in around 13 billion in gross cost reductions by the end of 2026. In addition to supporting our cost/income ratio target, this decrease also provides us with the necessary capacity to enhance the resilience of our combined infrastructure. It will also allow us to continue to drive enduring growth by investing in talent, products and services. We will focus on improving the client experience and lowering the cost to serve by leveraging our already-leading technology proficiencies. Another key driver of value creation will come from improved use of our financial resources. Obviously, the most prominent example is the Non-core and Legacy portfolio, where we expect our wind-down efforts to result in a capital release of over 6 billion by the end of 2026. Of equal importance, we need to optimize the utilization of financial resources across the core businesses to improve returns on risk-weighted assets. by capital intensive exposures, underpriced resources and products, and hurdle rates that were not aligned to underlying risks. While in the short-term, it will be difficult to produce the best-in-class returns that UBS had previously, our aim is to narrow the gap in a reasonable timeframe. This will require re-pricing and/or exiting low returning exposures. We will also remain disciplined to ensure that pricing reflects the underlying risks and the value of the advice, products and services we provide. As we do this, we will expect to capture gross inflows in GWM and P&C as we prioritize relationships where we provide more holistic client coverage. As I said, we assume that our actions to improve capital efficiency will result in a lower growth trajectory through 2025, a necessary trade-off to create long-term value. Now, moving to our medium-term priorities and ambitions for our business divisions, starting with GWM. We have robust momentum across our entire platform and our top objectives are to stay close to clients and improve advisor productivity. In Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, we expect PBT margins to eventually exceed 40% in each of these regions as we capture the benefits of our fortified leadership positions and integration-related synergies. While our U.S. wealth management business will profit from our strengthened Investment Bank and Asset Management franchises, it is not directly benefiting from increased scale related to the acquisition. Therefore, we need to keep working on improving our profitability. Over the next three years, we will organically invest to institutionalize our platform by building out our core banking infrastructure to provide clients with a more comprehensive loan and deposit offering, and by rolling out more products and services to Ultra High Net Worth and family and institutional wealth clients. We will further leverage our advisory capabilities through our global CIO platform. In particular, we aim to provide our international clients who have interests in the U.S. with more access to our American advisors and products. We will also continue to invest in our infrastructure to augment the user experience and improve productivity. We expect PBT margins in the U.S. to remain in the low double digits in the near-term, but we are confident that the actions we take will help produce mid-teens profit margins by the end of 2026. This will put us in a position to explore opportunities to further narrow the gap to our peers. Our actions will allow GWM to attract around 100 billion in net new assets per annum through 2025 as we expect to continue growth in our platform to partially offset by outflows related to the capital efficiency initiatives I described a moment ago. From 2026, our aim is to build to around 200 billion in net new assets annually by 2028. Overall, this level of organic growth over three years would nearly add up to the Credit Suisse franchise we just acquired, and will power our ambition to surpass 5 trillion in invested assets. Greater scale alongside our cost and capital efficiency measures will support GWM’s ability to achieve improved profitability with an expected underlying cost/income ratio of less than 70%. In Switzerland, we are the leading bank for multi-nationals and SMEs, and we also serve more than one in three households. To reiterate, our uniqueness is not driven by size, but by our ability to provide these clients with access to innovative products, solutions, digital applications and global footprint. In recent years, P&C’s consistent investments to improve the client experience and boost efficiency has supported steady growth and higher returns. We will replicate this playbook for our combined client franchises. Meanwhile, we will lower our cost to serve by streamlining our operations, decommissioning legacy technology platforms and removing branch duplication. Our ambition is for P&C to report a cost/income ratio below 50% as we exit 2026. In Asset Management, we are building on our differentiated offering in Sustainable Investing and SMAs with an expanded Alternatives platform, which includes new capabilities in Credit. Our aim is to keep growing our higher margin products, and capture the benefits of our increased scale in customized Indexing and a deeper regional footprint. We will do this while building on our strong partnership with Global Wealth Management to drive growth. While our improved strategic positioning and product offering will help us meet the evolving needs of our clients, we are not immune to structural issues facing the asset management industry. This makes the realization of cost synergies a critical component of our plan to get to a cost/income ratio below 70% by the end of 2026, while self-funding investments for growth and efficiency will be delivered. The acquisition has added capability that were already of strategic importance for our Investment Bank. Therefore, in terms of strategy, clients’ priorities and risk discipline, nothing changes. In Global Banking, we have significantly strengthened our coverage and product teams in growth markets that are aligned to GWM, notably the Americas and APAC. We have reinforced our leading position in Switzerland. And globally, we expect our broader and deeper solutions across M&A, Equity Capital Markets and Leveraged Capital Markets to drive profitable market share gains. We are already seeing the benefits with notable mandate successes across the globe. In Global Markets, we are bolstering core products and services that are most relevant to our clients, including Electronic Trading, Financing and Equity Derivatives. Our award-winning Equities and FX franchises will now serve an even larger and broader client base, also supported by our strengthened Global Research coverage of the most relevant and fastest-growing sectors. By deploying its products and services across a more diversified institutional, corporate and financial sponsor client base, in addition to the improved connectivity with our clients in GWM and P&C, the Investment Bank is poised to achieve around 15% return on attributed equity over the cycle. And it will do this while consuming no more than 25% of the Group’s risk weighted assets. As I mentioned before, the active run-down of the Non-core and Legacy portfolio releases capital, removes tail risks and complexity, and reduces our cost base, allowing us to improve our returns. We have made good progress to date. We have closed over two thousand NCL books, including full exits of several macro books, and are largely closed – we have largely closed our non-core Cash Equities, Convertibles and Prime Services exposures. To date, we have decommissioned around 150 of NCL systems, and retired nearly 20% of its models. As we further wind down this portfolio, we will focus on economic profitability, including funding, operating and capital costs. We will also remain focused on balancing our priorities with the needs of our clients and counterparties. Our ambition is for NCL’s underlying loss to move to around 1 billion, with the residual portfolio of total risk weighted assets accounting for around 5% of the Group’s by the end of 2026. By the end of 2024, we expect combined risk – credit and market risk risk-weighted assets to be substantially below 40 billion. Capital strength has been a key pillar of our strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons. We expect to operate with a CET1 capital ratio of around 14%. This will provide us with a substantial capital buffer relative to our minimum regulatory requirements during the integration, but also as our capital requirements increase over time. As we fund growth with part of our retained profits, we will also seek to calibrate the proportion of cash dividends versus buybacks. For the 2023 financial year, we intend to propose an ordinary dividend of 70 cents, a 27% increase year-on-year. With respect to our progressive dividend policy, we are accounting for a mid-teen percentage increase in 2024. We also plan to continue to distribute excess capital to shareholders via repurchases. In the short term, it is prudent to hold off until the parent bank merger is complete in the first half of this year. Then, we expect to resume buying back stocks, with a target of up to 1 billion dollars in 2024. Our ambition in 2026 is for total capital returns to exceed pre-acquisition levels, with share repurchases most likely being the biggest component. CET1 target as we exit 2026, with 2024 still reflecting the significant restructuring and optimization work taking place as we integrate Credit Suisse. Our plan is not relying on overly optimistic market assumptions. And, if necessary, we have the flexibility to adjust our plans as needed to respond to changes in the underlying assumptions. When our cost and capital efficiency measures are behind us, we expect to increase – we expect our increased scale and enhanced client franchises will position us to attain sustainably higher returns, starting with a reported return on CET1 capital of around 18% in 2028. With that, I hand back to Todd for more details on our plans.",['thank you todd decade ubs stood among g-sib peers favorable mix businesses unique model global asset gathering operation swiss

4Q23,Todd Tuckner,"Thanks again, Sergio. The strategic and detailed planning we’ve undertaken over the last several months now informs a clear path towards our objectives of generating an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and an underlying cost-income ratio of less than 70% by the time we complete the integration of Credit Suisse at the end of 2026. In the next few minutes, I’ll describe the ways in which we expect to achieve these objectives, offer details on trajectories, and comment on how we’ll measure progress. I want to emphasize that our plans are based on the complex work required to restructure a cost base that at present supports the infrastructure of two G-SIBs, and to enhance the returns on financial resources deployed in our core businesses that have been diluted by the acquisition. These significant efficiency undertakings come at a cost, whether through integration-related expenses or somewhat slower net new asset growth while we optimize the balance sheet over the next few quarters. Ultimately, the key to delivering our long-term financial ambitions is the discipline we’re applying now in driving cost and financial resource efficiency. between now and the end of 2026. Our financial ambitions are mainly dependent on controllable factors and market assumptions that are in line with consensus, rather than blue-sky scenarios. Our focus is on building high quality and sustainable revenue streams to support healthy and attractive returns over the long term. In this respect we’ll drive most of the improvement over the integration timeline by right sizing our cost base, optimizing financial resources, and normalizing the tax rate. Importantly, by building our plans primarily around cost and resource optimization, we retain flexibility and optionality in execution. For example, while we expect to continue investing for growth in our core businesses, we have discretion to pace this spend in case markets are less constructive. Finally, as we progress with simplification of our legal entity structure, we’ll see additional support to our capital returns from the normalization of the effective tax rate, dropping to around 23% by 2026. be one of the main drivers of our growth. As we expand our GWM invested asset base and enhance our solution offerings and capabilities, we expect to increase both recurring-fee and transaction-based income, with stronger net margins. By staying close to our clients, continuing to win back assets, and offering differentiated products and services to help navigate challenging market conditions, we expect to attract around 200 billion in net new assets over the next two years while optimizing returns on financial resources. Beyond 2025, with the optimization work largely behind us, we expect annual net new asset growth to build to 200 billion by 2028 and to surpass 5 trillion in assets under management at that time. In addition to growing our asset base, we believe we’re in a strong position to offset some of the structural fee margin pressure visible in the industry by leveraging a unified shelf of CIO-led products and solutions as well as increasing discretionary mandate penetration across our expanded client base. Further positive contribution to our GWM top line is expected from transaction-based fees. This growth is expected to be driven by the continued expansion of distribution channels and product capabilities, including growing and leveraging our successful GWM-IB joint coverage initiatives as well as broadening our scalable transaction-based advisory offerings for high- and ultra-high net worth clients, and clients with professional markets expertise. On top of revenue improvement, we also believe we can enhance GWM’s net margins and drive greater returns overall, by leveraging the benefits of increased scale, realizing cost synergies from the Credit Suisse integration, and emphasizing data and AI capabilities to improve advisor productivity. Second, in our Investment Bank, we’re well positioned to achieve revenue accretion relatively quickly, especially as we’re selectively adding key Credit Suisse IB resources directly to the UBS platform. As a result, we accelerate our IB strategy by doubling our Banking presence in the US and building on our market-leading strengths in Switzerland, EMEA and APAC. As the newly-onboarded bankers return to full productivity over the next 12-18 months, we expect Banking to generate almost twice its baseline revenues by 2026, assuming supportive markets. We also aim to drive incremental client flow across Derivatives & Solutions, Execution Services and Financing, with support from around 400 Credit Suisse colleagues joining our Markets business. Additionally, we expect continued revenue growth in the IB from technology and resource investments we've made in capabilities such as Research, FX, prime brokerage and equity derivatives, and from increased connectivity between the IB and GWM. We also price in a return to more normalized markets vs 2023. Moving to net interest income in GWM and P&C. As I mentioned earlier, we expect NII in US dollar terms to remain roughly stable in the first quarter of 2024 versus 4Q23. As we look out beyond the first quarter, full year 2024 NII is expected to decline by mid-single digits from annualized 4Q23 levels mainly on lower rates and as our financial resource optimization measures impact loan volumes. Over the second half of the plan horizon, we expect NII to recover, resulting from funding cost efficiencies, stable implied forward rates, and improved loan revenues. I’ll cover the steps we’re taking to drive funding efficiencies in a few moments. Rounding out the revenue picture across core businesses. We expect stable revenues in P&C, outside of NII, and in Asset Management, as we take actions to offset market headwinds and potential dis-synergies from the Credit Suisse acquisition while focusing these franchises on driving cost synergy realization and improvements in operating efficiency. In particular, P&C will continue its focus on winning back flows, improving asset efficiency, and defending market share in Switzerland while Asset Management embeds new investment capabilities acquired from Credit Suisse and continues its key role in providing advisory support to our Global Wealth Management clients. Finally, in NCL, we’re not pricing in revenue growth as we look forward, as the now largely fair value book reflects our expectation of exit prices. The roughly 3.1 billion of PPA adjustments we made to the NCL accrual book, before we tagged most of the positions as held for sale, are now subsumed in the marks. Hence, we expect NCL revenues in any given quarter from here to be around zero with position P&L from sales, unwinds and marks, net of hedging and funding costs, all to be broadly offsetting. Of course, as our first priority in NCL remains taking out costs and releasing sub-optimally deployed capital, we’ll at times sacrifice P&L on position exits in pursuit of these aims. 2026, around 4 billion, or one-third, are already reflected in our 2023 exit rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to generate more than 2 billion in gross exit-rate saves, with more towards the latter half of the year after saves of around 4 billion by the end of 2025 with the balance coming out as we exit 2026. The non-linear trajectory of cost saves between 2023 and 2026 reflects the intensity of our integration work, with the legal entity mergers, migration of over a million clients, and decommissioning of platforms requiring significant levels of workforce to execute against our timelines, especially over the next 12-18 months. As we progress on, and ultimately complete, these complex aspects of the integration, our resource requirements for these various programs of work will diminish, leading to considerable cost reductions by the end of 2025, when we expect to have delivered a substantial portion of our integration milestones. The back- end portion of our cost save plan relates mainly to completing hardware and software decommissioning, in particular switching off redundant legacy applications and infrastructure. This includes the applications in the various support and control functions, like Risk and Finance, where the work is naturally sequenced to follow the completion of client-facing technology decommissioning. As Sergio mentioned, we’ll re-invest part of the gross saves generated from the integration into enhancing the resilience of our technology estate and funding organic business growth in our core divisions. In terms of the nature of the gross cost saves, we expect that roughly half will be personnel-related costs as we streamline our front office operations across businesses and deliver synergies in our support and control functions. The remaining balance of saves will be derived predominantly from hardware and software decommissioning, real estate rationalization, and reduced service requirements from external providers and contractors. Moving to integration-related expenses, which we expect to total to around 13 billion by the end of 2026, including the 4 and a half billion incurred to date. Our objective is to front-load these expenses where possible as they typically pave the way for run-rate savings. For example, in real estate, we’ve taken restructuring and impairment charges on select properties, reducing the current run-rate cost of our footprint by 400 million per year, down 15% from 2022 levels. This save comes as a result of taking 1 billion in integration-related real estate charges through the end of 2023, with a payback of 2.5 years. This said, the timing of integration-related expenses and the resulting saves vary, depending on the cost category. Some charges can be provisioned upfront, as in the real estate example, while other provisions are recorded later, like severance costs for personnel whose services are required until an integration milestone is completed, such as the legal entity mergers or client platform migration. While we remain focused on accelerating these costs-to-achieve future savings wherever possible, we nevertheless expect to recognize integration-related expenses over the entire 3-year planning horizon, albeit with as much as 80 to 90% incurred by the end of 2025. Although the timing will differ, we still expect total integration-related costs to be broadly offset in our pre-tax P&L by the recognition of PPA-related pull-to-par revenue effects, including the portion now in the NCL marks, as described earlier. a considerable majority of net saves, to be achieved as a function of running down NCL’s book as well as eliminating its broader cost stack related to Credit Suisse’s complex legal entity structure and its historical G-SIB status. This includes expenses associated with governing, operating and maintaining Credit Suisse’s many regulated legal entities and branches. As I have highlighted, the mergers of our largest group entities later this year are expected to enable further workforce consolidation and management de-layering. For reference, our target legal entity structure is presented in the Appendix. Additionally, with complete exits of larger books of business in NCL, we expect to drive cost saves by reducing staff aligned to the unit and eliminating expensive-to-maintain technology applications and infrastructure. In this respect, we expect the trajectory of cost saves in NCL to accelerate in the second half of this year and to hasten further over the course of the following two years depending on the timing of larger-scale exits of position books. Ultimately, our objective is to limit the cost drag from NCL to a level substantially below 1 billion as we exit 2026, a drop of over 85% when compared to its 2022 cost base. Since the formation of NCL after the Credit Suisse acquisition, we’ve also taken steps to reduce the risk that any remaining costs are left stranded once we stop reporting NCL as a separate segment, expected in 2027. We completed most of this work ahead of NCL’s formation when we reviewed the way in which Credit Suisse’s Corporate Center costs were allocated among divisions. As part of our planning process we identified an additional 300 million of such costs that we’ll reallocate to the core business divisions, where they are more appropriately managed. This change will form part of the planned restatements that I described earlier. For 2024, we expect NCL to incur underlying operating expenses of around 4 billion, generating a pre-tax loss of also around 4 billion in light of the zero revenue guidance I offered earlier. do. It gives us the ability to withstand financial shocks and the flexibility to support our clients in all climates. It’s especially critical during this complex integration process. As highlighted earlier during the fourth quarter review, we’re maintaining appropriately prudent capital and liquidity levels while executing the restructuring of Credit Suisse and preparing for new regulatory requirements. This is also the case for our key operating subsidiaries. With these considerations in mind, I’ll now cover how we think about capital, liquidity and funding across the Group as we look out over the planning horizon. First, capital. At the end of 4Q, the Group maintained a going-concern capital ratio of 17.0%, over 200 basis points above the current Swiss requirements, comprised of 14.5% in CET1 capital and 2.5% in additional Tier 1 capital. Between 2026 and 2030 our going-concern capital requirement is expected to increase by around 180 basis points to 16.7% as the effects of the currently larger balance sheet and greater market share from the Credit Suisse acquisition are phased-in. To improve efficiency of our capital stack, we intend to fund this increase by cost-effectively building-out the permissible AT1 bucket over time, bringing the going concern capital ratio to around 18% while broadly maintaining our CET1 capital ratio at around 14%. In this respect, following last year’s successful raises, we expect to issue up to 2 billion in AT1 in 2024. A word on going concern capital at our parent bank, UBS AG, on a pro-forma post-merger basis. The main take-away here is that we expect a healthy buffer over regulatory requirements on a fully applied basis and even without the substantial regulatory concession historically applied to Credit Suisse AG’s investments in subsidiaries. Any increases in UBS AG’s going-concern capital requirements from greater market share and a larger balance sheet will be funded in much the same way I described for the Group, and by being disciplined in right-sizing UBS AG and its subsidiaries. In terms of gone-concern capital, I would highlight that, for now, UBS AG’s standalone requirement serves as the binding constraint for the Group. As such, we consider the Group’s current substantial TLAC buffers to be appropriate, and, accordingly, we intend to replace maturing TLAC at similar tenors. Over time, as we reduce the leverage in our businesses, we expect to see the level of Holdco start to tick down, with some potential to tighten average spreads in the back book. On to liquidity and funding. Beyond our approach to TLAC and AT1, our strategic objective in the context of liquidity and funding is to balance efficiency with resiliency and safety. In this respect, we maintain liquidity levels among the highest in the industry, satisfying the more stringent Swiss liquidity requirements that took effect last month. At the same time, we’ve begun executing on a funding plan that drives significant funding cost efficiencies over the next 3 years, principally from reducing the size of our balance sheet. Specifically, we expect to reduce LRD by over 100 billion at constant FX via the wind-down of NCL and from resource optimization across our core business divisions, driving down funding needs. We also aim to narrow the structural funding gap of the Swiss entity inherited from Credit Suisse, increasing the self-sufficiency of the post-merger Swiss banking subsidiary. In this respect, deposits remain a key source of funding. We’ll continue to focus on winning them back, with emphasis on stability reflected in tenors, products, and counterparty selection. In addition to applying discipline on deposit pricing, we expect to take actions to optimize our funding mix and drive down costs, including reducing our levels of OpCo by making further use of Swiss covered bonds and tapping an expanded variety of funding markets. Overall, as a result of lower funding needs, diversified and more stable funding sources, tighter issuance spreads relative to 2023 levels, and disciplined deposit pricing, we believe we can realize funding cost saves of up to 1 billion by 2026 on top of the saves achieved last year. This is reflected in our long-term NII guidance that I described earlier. Let me now walk you through our RWA expectations over the next three years. In NCL, we expect the run-off of its book to drive a decrease in risk weighted assets of 45 billion by the end of 2026 bringing us to around 5% of the Group’s total RWAs before any further post-integration de-risking. In our core businesses, we expect Basel 3 to increase RWA by around 15 billion beginning in 2025, primarily from FRTB, credit risk, and CVA changes in the final standard. The core businesses are also expected to absorb around 10 billion of additional RWA, net of 14 billion from converting Credit Suisse’s risk models to the appropriate UBS standard. I would also highlight that we expect the resource optimization work we’re undertaking to result in RWA reduction of around 15 billion in the core businesses. Importantly, this impact can vary depending on the availability of revenue-growth opportunities driving accretive returns. All told, over the next 3 years, Group RWA is expected to drop from its current levels by 35 billion at constant FX, freeing up around 5 billion in CET1 capital. mainly due to losses generated by various Credit Suisse entities, primarily in Switzerland, the US and the UK, that cannot at present offset profits in their counterpart UBS entities in the same jurisdictions. The legal entity mergers planned for later this year will resolve a considerable level of this inefficiency, driving down our effective tax rate to around 40% by the end of 2024. Further optimization of our legal entity structure, combined with improved profitability and opportunities for tax planning, are expected to drive the effective tax rate to below 30% by the end of 2025, and finally to our normal levels of around 23% in 2026. In terms of deferred tax assets, our year-end 2023 balance sheet reflects recognition of around 3 billion in net tax loss DTAs, mainly relating to the US. Of those, we expect to amortize around 0.5 billion against profits and convert around 2 billion into temporary difference DTAs by the end of 2025, seeking to maintain a balance equal to the eligible cap of 10% of our CET1 capital. The remaining level of recognized net tax loss DTAs of 0.5 billion, absent further planning considerations, is expected to remain relatively stable over the near term. It is worth highlighting that the more modest level of tax loss DTAs expected over the next couple of years limits the impact of one of the key differentiators between tangible equity and CET1, signalling their convergence. Finally, let me briefly touch on how we plan to communicate our progress across the integration timeline. As you would expect, demonstrating the headway we’re making in our cost reduction plans is, and will remain, of paramount importance. We intend to regularly report on developments, and to track our performance vs the opex and integration cost trajectories I described earlier, even when we switch back to focusing on year-over- year comparisons by 3Q24. NCL risk reduction will continue to feature in our quarterly performance reporting. And we’ll periodically check in on where we stand in terms of key integration milestones, including the legal entity mergers, systems migration of client accounts and infrastructure decommissioning, as well as improving overall efficiency in the utilization of our financial resources. With that, I hand back to Sergio for his closing remarks before we move to Q&A.",['thanks again sergio strategic detailed planning we’ve undertaken last several months informs clear path towards

4Q24,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Before we provide an update on how we are delivering on our priorities to meet our 2026 commitments, let me share some highlights for 2024. profitability across our businesses. Our full-year net profit of 5.1 billion and underlying return on CET1 capital of 8.7% reflect our unwavering commitment to serving our clients, our diversified global franchise and the disciplined progress we have made on our integration plans. Throughout 2024, we maintained robust momentum as we captured growth across our global asset-gathering platform and gained market share in the Investment Bank in the areas where we have made strategic investments. With over 70 billion Swiss francs of loans granted or renewed during the year, and outstanding balance of 350 billion, we also maintained our commitment as a reliable partner for the Swiss economy, supporting families and businesses to achieve their goals. We delivered on all of our key integration milestones in 2024, including all major legal entity mergers, and the successful completion of our client account migrations in Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan in the fourth quarter. This builds upon the successful integration of our key operating entities, the optimization of our balance sheet and the reduction of costs and risk-weighted assets in Non-core and Legacy. Combined, these milestones have significantly reduced the execution risk of the Credit Suisse acquisition. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration and deliver on our financial targets by the end of 2026. Our capital position remains robust as we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%. For the financial year 2024, we intend to propose a dividend of 90 cents, representing a 29% increase year-on-year. This is in line with our intention to calibrate the proportion of cash dividends and share repurchases. As we execute on our business and integration plans, we are building additional capacity to invest in our people and to enhance our products and capabilities. This will allow us to better serve our clients and position UBS for future success. That includes the Americas, a region that remains a core component of both our asset-gathering foundation and our capital-efficient business model. In 2024, we started to make changes across the business to introduce new capabilities that will help increase the operating leverage of our platform, improve profitability and drive sustainable growth. Across all of our businesses and supporting functions, we continue to invest in technology, leveraging our strong foundation to improve the client experience and enhance how we operate.",['thank you sarah good morning everyone provide update delivering priorities meet 2026 commitments let share highlights 2024 profitability across businesses full-year net profit 51 billion underlying return cet1 capital 87% reflect unwavering commitment serving clients diversified global franchise disciplined progress made integration plans throughout 2024 maintained robust momentum captured growth across global asset-gathering platform gained market share investment bank areas made strategic investments 70 billion swiss francs loans granted renewed year outstanding balance 350 billion also maintained commitment reliable partner swiss economy supporting families businesses achieve goals delivered key integration milestones 2024 including major legal entity mergers successful completion client account migrations luxembourg hong kong singapore japan fourth quarter builds upon successful integration key operating entities optimization balance sheet reduction costs risk-weighted assets non-core legacy combined milestones significantly reduced execution risk credit suisse acquisition result remain confident ability substantially complete integration deliver financial targets end 2026 capital position remains robust ended year cet1 capital ratio 143% financial year 2024 intend propose dividend 90 cents representing 29% increase year-on-year line intention calibrate proportion cash dividends share repurchases execute business integration plans building additional capacity invest people enhance products capabilities allow us better serve clients position ubs future success includes americas region remains core component asset-gathering foundation capital-efficient business model 2024 started make changes across business introduce new capabilities help increase operating leverage platform improve profitability drive sustainable growth across businesses supporting functions continue invest technology leveraging strong foundation improve client experience enhance operate']
4Q24,Todd Tuckner,"Thank you Sergio, and good morning everyone. unless stated otherwise. For the fourth quarter, profit before tax tripled to 1.8 billion. Revenue momentum in our core franchises and cost synergies across the Group drove a 12-point improvement in operating leverage. Our EPS for the quarter was 23 cents with a 7.2% underlying return on CET1 capital. Our underlying cost-income ratio was 82%. billion, driven mainly by strong top-line growth in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, powered by our capabilities and advice in supportive market conditions. Operating expenses declined by 6% year-over-year to 9.1 billion, and were 1% lower sequentially as progress on synergies and a stronger US dollar more than offset the expected 4Q tick-up in non-personnel expenses. This achievement was supported by a lower overall employee count, which fell sequentially by another 2%, to below 129 thousand. The total staff count is down 27 thousand, or 17%, from our 2022 baseline. Excluding litigation, variable compensation and currency effects, operating expenses decreased by 9% year- over-year. The 4% quarter-over-quarter increase was caused by seasonally higher charges, including the UK bank levy and increased marketing expenditures. Our reported profit before tax for the quarter included 0.7 billion of revenue adjustments relating to PPA effects, a remeasurement loss of 0.1 billion on an investment in an associate, and 1.3 billion of integration-related expenses. Reported net profit was 0.8 billion in the quarter on an effective tax rate of 26%. We expect a similar tax rate in the first quarter. GWM’s pre-tax profit was 1.1 billion, an increase of over 80% as revenues grew by 10%. Excluding litigation charges, PBT rose to 1.2 billion. Net new assets reached 18 billion and net new fee-generating assets were 13 billion, fueled by sales of mandates and separately managed accounts. Flow performance this quarter reflects the maturity of over 50 billion of fixed-term deposits associated with our 2023 win-back campaign. Like in previous quarters, we managed to retain over 85% on our platform, including converting over 20% into more profitable solutions, including mandates. For the full year 2024, we acquired net new assets of 97 billion, representing a 2.5% growth rate. As I’ve highlighted in the past, our net new asset achievement this year reflects several challenges that we successfully navigated over the course of 2024. This includes retaining the vast majority of Credit Suisse invested assets despite significant levels of relationship manager attrition, keeping the bulk of maturing fixed-term deposits as just mentioned in the context of 4Q, and increasing profitability on sub-hurdle lending relationships from our balance sheet optimization efforts. Collectively, while these factors weighed down flows by around 30 billion, importantly they’ve contributed to enhanced profitability and returns. This is evidenced by the 3 percentage point year-over-year increase in revenues over RWA. Recurring net fee income increased by 12% to 3.3 billion as our invested assets grew sequentially to 4.2 trillion, absorbing roughly 80 billion in FX headwinds. Client traction with mandates remained strong with around 5 billion in net new mandates globally, mainly driven by sales of our differentiated discretionary solutions and supported by continued momentum in SMAs in the US. Margins held up sequentially and are expected to remain around these levels, especially as recently migrated clients and those remaining on the Credit Suisse platform now have access to the full breadth of our CIO value- chain-led offering. This quarter we once again demonstrated the benefits of combining our leading markets solutions and capabilities with our CIO’s investment calls. This drove a 12% increase in transaction-based revenues in an environment that saw broad re-risking after the US elections. Structured products, equities, and alternatives all recorded double-digit transaction revenue increases. Our investments in capabilities, solutions, and unified teams support the durability of this revenue line and fuel our ability to capture wallet-share in all climates. Year-on-year transaction revenue growth was led by APAC and the Americas, up by 30% and 13%, respectively. Net interest income at 1.7 billion was up 4% sequentially, reflecting improvements in both lending and deposit margins. While fixed term deposit balances decreased in the quarter, we saw inflows into sweeps and current accounts across our platform as our clients increased transactional balances in a constructive trading environment. I would note that the planned sweep deposit pricing changes I mentioned previously went into effect for our US advisory accounts in early December. Our 2025 outlook as a result of introducing these rate adjustments remains unchanged. Turning to our NII outlook for GWM. Since I offered an initial view on 2025 last quarter, we’ve seen a significant divergence in rates expectations between the US dollar, on the one hand, and the Swiss franc and Euro on the other. This distinction is important for GWM. While our US business is effectively operated entirely in US dollars, in GWM’s businesses outside the US, half of all deposits, and the majority of loans and low-beta transactional account balances, are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Looking at the rates outlook, the Federal Reserve is now expected to cut US dollar rates more gradually. Meanwhile, both the Swiss and the European central banks are expected to continue to more actively cut. Based on this, in the first quarter, we expect to see headwinds from lower rates, particularly in the Swiss franc and Euro, and lower balances from deployment of sweep and transactional account balances, partially offset by higher margins from balance sheet optimization. Combined with a lower day count effect, this is expected to result in a low-to-mid single-digit-percentage sequential decrease in GWM’s NII. Looking further out, lower Swiss franc and Euro rates will remain a headwind to deposit margins, partially offset by the benefits of continued balance sheet optimization, particularly on the deposit side. Net new loan growth should also help. I should note that if we do see a more hawkish US dollar rates policy, while helpful to deposit margins, this is likely to moderate the extent of re-leveraging, particularly in Lombard lending. For full year 2025 compared to 2024, we expect a low single digit percentage decrease in NII, inflecting by 2Q, with the second half of the year broadly flat versus 2H24. Underlying operating expenses were unchanged from last year at 4.8 billion, with lower personnel and support costs offset by higher variable compensation tied to revenues and increased litigation provisions. To offer a look-through comparison, excluding litigation, variable compensation, FX, and last year’s FDIC special assessment, costs were down 5% year-over-year. P&C delivered fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 572 million Swiss francs, down 18%, primarily from lower interest rates affecting net interest income, down 8%, and elevated credit loss expense. Recurring net fee income increased by 8% driven by higher volumes of investment products and gross margin expansion. Transaction-based revenues were up 13%, also on higher client activity. Sequentially, NII decreased slightly by 1%. We offset some of the effects of the SNB’s third 25-basis point rate cut from late September by moderately decreasing deposit rates and pricing loans to appropriately reflect risk and capital costs. After the 50 basis point cut by the SNB in December there is a reasonable likelihood that we’ll see interest rates drop to zero by mid-2025. The impact of near-zero rates will drive down deposit margins both sequentially and for the full year 2025. Additional headwinds in 1Q are expected from the sequential day count effect and lower rates in US dollar and Euro affecting deposit margins on transactional accounts. Hence, for P&C’s Swiss franc NII, we currently expect a roughly 10% sequential decline in the first quarter. For full year 2025, the drop will be somewhat more pronounced versus 2024, with NII expected to trough in the second quarter and plateau thereafter. From there, any move in interest rates, whether negative or positive, should be constructive to our NII and net interest margin in P&C. Credit loss expense was 155 million Swiss francs, a 25-basis point cost of risk on an average loan portfolio of 243 billion. The quarterly result was driven by Stage 3 charges, predominantly from new-venture financings and loans to corporates in the metals and automotive industries, which have shown financial vulnerability in a challenging market environment across Europe. These exposures, by and large, are on the Credit Suisse platform, reflecting lending practices and underwriting standards from the pre-acquisition period. We expect CLE to remain elevated at around 350 million Swiss francs in 2025 as we continue to build allowances for pre-acquisition Credit Suisse portfolios, with many exposures still having more than a year until maturity. In the first quarter, we may see lower CLE versus the implied quarterly average due to seasonal factors. Operating expenses in P&C were 1.1 billion Swiss francs, up 2%, and flat sequentially, as the business offset increased investments in building up support functions related to its larger footprint through cost reduction initiatives and synergy realization. discipline more than offset lower revenues. Overall revenues were down 7%, or 6% excluding gains on asset sales. Net management fees declined by 5%, mainly from continuing shifts out of active equities compressing top- line margins. Performance fees were 44 million, compared to 52 million in the prior year quarter, with improvement in hedge fund solutions more than offset by decreases across other products, including Fixed Income funds. Net new money in the quarter was positive 33 billion, led by a large institutional inflow in passive Equities and net flows into money market funds. For the full-year 2024, net new money was 45 billion, a strong result in light of flow dis-synergies we were expecting from integrating Credit Suisse Asset Management. Operating expenses were 15% lower, both year-over-year and sequentially, as the business is demonstrating good progress in transforming its operating model and driving cost saves. up 37% year-on-year. Banking revenues increased by 19% to 675 million, with advisory, up 36%, and LCM, which more than doubled its revenues, the main drivers of growth. Regionally, we saw particular strength in the Americas, up 33%. Markets revenues increased by 44% to 1.9 billion with increased client activity on higher cash volumes and supportive volatility across equities and FX. This led to our best fourth quarter Markets revenue on record with particular strength in financing supported by all-time-high client balances. For Markets, regional revenues in the Americas and APAC surged by around 50%, and grew by about a third in EMEA, driven by broad-based increases across both equities and FRC. Operating expenses were down 4% on lower personnel costs. million, mainly reflecting funding costs that, unlike in prior quarters, were not offset by gains on exits or the carry in our now much smaller credit book. Operating expenses were down by nearly 50% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, as we continue to make good progress in driving out costs. NCL risk-weighted assets were 41 billion, down 3 billion sequentially, mainly from position exits. LRD was down 15 billion, or 22% quarter-on-quarter. sheet for all seasons consisted of 1.6 trillion in total assets, including around 600 billion in end-of-period loans and 750 billion in end-of-period deposits. Our loan portfolio reflected credit-impaired exposures of 1%, up sequentially by 4 basis points. The cost of risk in the quarter increased to 15 basis points, as credit loss expense in our Swiss business drove this measure higher. We ended the year with a sequentially unchanged CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%, as a decline in CET1 capital of 2.8 billion was offset by a proportionate decrease in risk weighted assets of 21 billion. CET1 capital was mainly affected by the stronger US dollar as well as by higher cash taxes and dividend accruals, more than offsetting quarterly profits. RWA likewise was lower on currency effects as well as asset size reductions, mainly in the IB and NCL. To summarize, our fourth quarter performance caps off a strong 2024 in which our Non-core and Legacy team successfully ran down balance sheet and costs and our core franchises demonstrated strength and scale in delivering for our clients, even while absorbing substantial costs associated with the integration. With that, I hand back to Sergio for the investor update.",['thank sergio good morning everyone unless stated otherwise fourth quarter profit tax tripled 18 billion revenue momentum core franchises

4Q24,Sergio P. Ermotti,"Thank you, Todd. For over a decade, UBS has been a source of strength and stability for all of our stakeholders thanks to the consistent execution of our capital-generative strategy and a commitment to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons. Our global capabilities empower strong collaboration across our businesses to deliver the best of UBS to our clients, and our disciplined focus on risk and efficiency is at the forefront of our culture. This is why our clients continue to extend their trust and confidence in UBS, and our employees are proud to work here. It is how we generate significant value for our shareholders while remaining a consistent and reliable economic partner in the communities where we operate. And it has also allowed us to be a source of financial stability for Switzerland and the wider financial system in March of 2023. The same principles guide us as we build an even stronger, safer and more efficient firm, and position UBS for sustainably higher returns and long-term growth. Our unique business model, with our asset gathering businesses generating around 60% of our revenues, provides us with an attractive risk and return profile that continues to stand out among our global peers. We are the largest truly global wealth manager, and the leading universal bank in Switzerland. These two key pillars of our strategy are enhanced by a portfolio of best-in-class capabilities across Asset Management and our competitive, but capital-light Investment Bank. With leading franchises in the world’s largest and fastest-growing markets, our regional diversification is a strategic advantage and also provides us unique value for both our clients and investors. Turning to the integration. As I highlighted earlier, we are on track with our plans thanks to the successful delivery of our key objectives in 2024, having completed over 4,000 milestones during the year. Following the merger of our Parent Banks, we have now migrated over 90% of client accounts outside of Switzerland onto UBS platforms. In addition, the integration of the Investment Bank is now complete, and in Asset Management, we made good progress migrating portfolios onto our infrastructure and rationalizing our fund shelf. We also continue to follow our technology decommissioning roadmap. To date, we have removed over 40% of Non-core and Legacy’s applications, worked through 16 petabytes of data and reduced the number of legacy servers by over 40%. Thanks to our restructuring efforts and the active wind-down of NCL, we have captured almost 60% of our targeted 13 billion gross cost savings. We will look to maintain this momentum in 2025 as our focus shifts to migrating the majority of client accounts in Switzerland, and decommissioning over twelve hundred Credit Suisse models and applications. We have always said that our progress on the integration of Credit Suisse will not be a straight line. Our performance in 2025 will continue to reflect significant restructuring work necessary to integrate our businesses and right-size our cost base. Having said that, our progress to date supports an incremental improvement in our returns this year compared to our previous guidance. We remain confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration and deliver on our targets and ambitions by the end of 2026. At the same time, we will continue to invest to drive sustainable growth and long-term value beyond the integration. Investing in technology to benefit our clients and empower our colleagues is one of the key ways we are preparing for the future. We continue to invest in our best-in-class Cloud infrastructure with over 70% in the public and private Cloud. This is a key facilitator of our integration progress, allowing us to reduce complexity and costs as we remove legacy applications, while maintaining our compliance and security standards. It is also an important catalyst for innovation as we continue to invest in tools to enhance our client offering and increase efficiency and effectiveness. A good example is our roll-out of 50,000 Microsoft Copilot licenses to our employees in the largest deployment within the global financial services industry to date. We are also seeing strong benefits from our proprietary generative A.I. solutions. One example is in the U.S. where our advanced analytics platform supported our financial advisors with over 13 million automated insights and actionable opportunities. Solutions like this improve productivity and our ability to deliver tailored solutions to our clients. We are on track to deliver on our 2026 exit rate ambitions across our core businesses. While we are encouraged In GWM, we remain focused on leveraging our enhanced capabilities and solutions to maintain client momentum. At the same time, we aim to capture the benefits of integration-related synergies and improve advisor productivity. With the client account migrations achieved in APAC, we are even better placed to leverage our number-one position in the region to drive market-leading growth. In the Americas, we are making targeted investments to deepen relationships with our ultra-high net worth clients, accelerate growth in the high net worth and core affluent segments and expand our loan and deposit offering. These growth initiatives will be supported by actions we have already taken to enhance our technology offering, simplify our organizational structure and improve execution. I am confident in our ability to deliver mid-teen PBT margins as we exit 2026. Then, the business will be better positioned to further expand profit margins and capture long-term growth. Todd will take you through our plans in more detail. In P&C, as we have said previously, declining Swiss franc rates are expected to continue to affect revenues. We are still de-facto operating two separate banks, including branches, staff, and technology, but we are well positioned to start delivering cost synergies later this year and into 2026 as we unite those platforms. Unfortunately, as we reported previously, this will lead to certain role reductions in Switzerland. We plan to mitigate the impact of these as much as possible through natural attrition, early retirement and other measures. For those impacted we will provide proactive support in helping to find a new job, and a comprehensive social plan that combines the strongest components of the prior UBS and Credit Suisse plans. I am also especially proud of efforts to prioritize the hiring of internal candidates: over two-thirds of open positions in Switzerland were filled this way in 2024. In Asset Management, we remain focused on continuing to capture opportunities where we have a differentiated and scalable offering. This includes our newly launched Unified Global Alternatives unit, which makes us the fifth-largest Limited Partner in Alternatives with promising growth prospects. At the same time, we will remain focused on realizing cost synergies and structural efficiencies to create capacity for investments and improve profitability. In the Investment Bank, I am encouraged by the progress our fully integrated teams are making to deliver for clients as we seize market share gains in our areas of strategic importance. As we continue to deploy our products and services across our broader institutional client base and increase connectivity to GWM and P&C to deliver on our return ambitions, we will maintain our well-established risk and capital discipline. Turning to capital. We continue to target a CET1 capital ratio of around 14%. At this level, we will be able to go through the integration period and beyond with a strong capital buffer relative to minimum requirements. This will allow us to remain a source of stability while we self-fund growth and deliver attractive capital returns to our shareholders. For the 2025 financial year, we plan to accrue for an increase in our dividend of around 10 percent. We also plan to repurchase another 1 billion dollars of shares in the first half of this year, and up to an additional 2 billion in the second half. As in the past, our share repurchases will be consistent with delivering on our financial plans and maintaining our CET1 capital ratio target of around 14%, and assuming no material, immediate changes to the current capital regime. Our ambition for capital returns to exceed pre-acquisition levels in 2026 remains unchanged. Now, following the publication of the Parliamentary Investigation Commission’s report in December, we expect further developments in the ongoing review of the capital regime in Switzerland. Based on the latest public communication from the State Secretariat for International Finance, the public consultation on the proposal is expected to begin in May. Therefore, at this time, we are not in a position to offer any new information. As we have said in the past, we support the vast majority of proposals from the Swiss Federal Council on how to enhance the regulatory framework in Switzerland. In our discussions with Swiss authorities, we continue to maintain our view that the Swiss capital regime is one of the strongest when consistently and coherently applied. While it is also crystal clear that the overall quality of our capital is of a much higher standard than Credit Suisse’s, we accept that some adjustments and clarifications to the current regime may be necessary. However, a disproportionate outcome in terms of requirements at the Parent Bank level would drive our capital at the Group level to overshoot the current requirements. Therefore, we believe that any significant change is unjustified. Offsetting the consequences of higher requirements would make us uncompetitive domestically and abroad, hamper our ability to help clients grow and, importantly, make banking services more expensive for Swiss families and enterprises in the long run. It will also damage the nation’s standing as an attractive global financial center and ultimately hurt our position as the third-largest private employer in Switzerland. Of course, this would have an impact on our returns on capital. But even more importantly it would impede our ability to compete for capital in the global marketplace, particularly in a moment of financial stress. As a reminder, our current ambitions are based on a 14% CET1 capital ratio. I’ve been reading some recent reports. So, let me be very clear. There are no easy fixes in terms of repatriation of capital from foreign subsidiaries or balance sheet optimization that are not already included in our plans. Therefore, while I am extremely confident in our capital generation capacity under any outcome, our shareholder returns and returns on capital would be affected. Todd will provide more detail later. We want to continue to be a source of strength for our clients, employees, shareholders and Switzerland. For that reason, it is very important that a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis on the consequences of any material changes of capital requirements is carried out. We remain hopeful that any potential changes will be proportionate, targeted, internationally aligned and coherent with the strategic objectives set out by the Swiss",['thank you todd decade ubs

4Q24,Federal Council.,"As I mentioned before, we have substantially de-risked the integration across many dimensions. This is reflected in our return profile, which has significantly improved compared to a year ago. Our goal is to continue to rebuild profitability in 2025 as we further progress our integration plan and capture the benefits of our enhanced scale and capabilities across our businesses. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 15% return on CET1 capital target by the end 2026. We will then look to achieve UBS’s pre-acquisition levels of profitability and deliver on our 2028 ambitions. We have achieved so much over the last two years, and I am proud of the immense effort of all of my colleagues. But there is no room for complacency, and we remain focused on serving our clients, delivering on the next phase of the integration and fulfilling our growth initiatives as we position UBS for a successful future.

4Q24,Todd Tuckner,"Thanks again, Sergio. I will now offer a more detailed perspective on our financial outlook for 2025 and the With each of our core businesses well positioned to drive sustainable growth, in 2025 we expect to generate an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 10% versus 8.7% in 2024. This year-on-year increase reflects our expectation that Non-core and Legacy will weigh on our financial performance more significantly than last year. Importantly, this also means that our core businesses are expected to be the main drivers of year-on-year growth in returns despite continuing to absorb, together with NCL, the costs associated with restructuring and integrating the businesses, legal entities, infrastructure and teams inherited with the acquisition. For full-year 2025, we expect an effective tax rate of around 20%, as we aim to implement tax planning later in the year, mainly related to the combination of legal entities in the US. The acceleration we expect in 2026, when our in-year return on CET1 should be low teens and our exit-rate around 15%, will be driven predominantly by the benefits from more than three years of extensive integration, restructuring and transformation effort. As I’ve highlighted in the past, we continue to expect more significant cost reductions across the core businesses as we retire legacy infrastructure and create further staff capacity. Revenues should also receive an uplift as we complete the integration and play more on our front foot with no distractions, generating alpha across our core franchises. Moreover, most of the headwinds to returns we see in 2025 are expected to dissipate by the end of 2026. These include NII and credit loss expenses in Switzerland, with the latter, starting next year, expected to reflect a substantial conversion towards P&C’s historical average cost of risk as a result of increased allowances and legacy Credit Suisse loan maturities. Additionally, as we exit 2026, we expect to see better profitability in our US wealth business, and further reductions to our Non-core and Legacy portfolio, decreasing its drag on resources and profits. As I’ve mentioned before, the plans underpinning our ambitions are largely determined by factors within our control. While we expect to continue to invest for growth, we retain the necessary optionality and operating flexibility to support our profitability and returns ambitions, regardless of market conditions. of which 3.4 billion in 2024, putting us well on track towards achieving our goal of around 13 billion by the end of 2026. Of the cumulative gross saves achieved to date, 4 billion contributed to net cost reductions, with much of this progress driven by NCL. Importantly, while the overall cost base decreased by 10% from its 2022 base line, if we exclude litigation and variable compensation linked to revenues, we delivered a 17% net reduction in underlying expenses on this look-through basis. Looking out over the next two years, we expect around 5 and a half billion of additional gross cost saves across technology, third party spend, real estate and from unlocking additional staff capacity. As we’ve highlighted previously, while we remain continuously focused on driving cost savings by reducing duplication and streamlining wherever possible, we do not expect our sequential cost reduction to be linear. The impact on our cost base varies each quarter, depending on the timing of large-scale integration initiatives that drive efficiencies across infrastructure, real estate and workforce optimization. Over the next two years, the most meaningful driver of cost reductions will be the decommissioning of legacy infrastructure, with the most prominent example the retirement of the Swiss platform, which will only happen after the client account migration is finalized next year. At that point, we’ll decommission the associated hardware, data centers and software applications, including systems in the middle and back office that are linked to client facing platforms. The continued run-down of NCL and further rationalization of our real estate footprint and legal entity structure will also support our realizing cost synergies over the next two years as we work towards our exit-2026 cost/income ratio target of less than 70%. Moreover, with almost 60% of our gross cost save ambition achieved through the end of 2024, we now have a clearer line of sight as to the costs to achieve the successful completion of our integration plans. We now expect cumulative integration-related expenses to total around 14 billion. The 1 billion in incremental spend largely compensates for lower-than-anticipated staff attrition levels and accelerated real estate exits. It also accounts for investments in new opportunities to unlock long-term value creation in connection with select Credit Suisse businesses. With over 4 trillion in invested assets, our scale, global connectivity, innovation and CIO-led advice and solutions uniquely position us to capture wallet and seize growth opportunities across our global footprint. GWM Americas, which comprises our US, Canada and Latin America wealth businesses is a leading wealth management provider, with 2.1 trillion of assets served by nearly 6 thousand financial advisors. In Switzerland and EMEA, we’re the number one player, combining our global offering with regional adaptations and client proximity. And, in APAC, with a broad and well-diversified footprint, we’re the number one wealth manager, twice as large as our next closest competitor. cost/income ratio of 80%, while restoring its capital efficiency to levels similar to those before the acquisition. In 2025, returns are expected to grow year-over-year as we continue to capitalize on our enduring competitive advantages, underpinned by secular tailwinds. The industry trends we see accelerating across our global family, ultra and high net worth client segments, including legacy and longevity-based planning needs, geographic wealth migration and multi-disciplinary client solutions, play right to our strengths. We expect these dynamics to drive revenue growth in 2025. Moreover, our teams of advisors, investment managers and solution specialists are leveraging our client account migration efforts as a unique opportunity to review and rebalance client portfolios, while supporting our clients during their transition to the UBS platform. This work supports our outlook of continued, increasing mandate penetration and gross margin stability. Also, GWM’s costs are expected to decrease over the course of 2025, principally as we decommission platforms following the first wave of client account migration work completed last year. As in 2024, GWM’s net new asset ambition will continue to reflect the actions and other dynamics I’ve highlighted that support higher pre-tax margins and returns on attributed equity, but, at times, come at the expense of flows. While in Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, the impact on flows is expected to soften over the course of the year, in the US, our efforts to align financial advisor incentives with our strategic priorities may result in a short-term increase in FA attrition, creating an additional headwind for net new assets in the coming months. We therefore maintain our net new asset ambition of around 100 billion for 2025. Yet, in 2026, with the integration behind us, and flow headwinds fully addressed, we expect GWM net new assets to begin to accelerate towards our ambition of 200 billion per annum and over 5 trillion in invested assets by 2028. Moreover, the improvement in ECM activity we’re starting to observe across the globe should ultimately play to our asset-gathering strengths. This coincides with increasing levels of monetization among wealth management clients, which is expected to translate into greater opportunities to intensify engagement, capture share of wallet, and deliver advice and solutions. Our Americas wealth business, our foothold into the world’s largest wealth pool, is a key pillar of our long-term growth strategy and value proposition to clients. In addition to accounting for around 50% of our total asset base, it also contributes a similar proportion to GWM’s global revenues. Given the strategic importance of the Americas business, we recognize that improving its financial performance is both a necessity and a priority. Since 2019, we’ve grown the region’s invested assets and revenues at a CAGR of 8% and 4%, respectively, and delivered profit margins averaging mid-teens. After reaching a record pre-tax margin of 19% in 2021, we’ve seen profitability retreat to its current level of around 10%. While our revenues have grown, expenses have grown faster. With a business model mostly geared towards the most financially sophisticated ultra and family clients, the post-pandemic market dynamics of rising equity prices and soaring interest rates caused a shift in our revenue mix that drove up variable compensation levels and compressed profit margins. At the same time, technology costs were increasing as part of our efforts to improve and modernize the digital experience for our clients and advisors, but also to address past investments in large programs where delivery had been suboptimal. On top of this, the cost of recruiting advisors, back office spend and litigation charges all grew. To address these challenges, we’re changing how we operate to improve profitability and position the business for more efficient and sustainable growth. Since the end of last year, we’ve already taken actions to streamline our organizational structure, improve cost discipline and align the incentives of our financial advisors to our strategic objectives. As these changes take hold, and given our intention to fund incremental strategic investments, we expect our pre-tax margin in 2025 to remain at broadly current levels. We then expect to make more material progress and steadily improve towards mid-teens by 2027. At that point, the business will be better positioned to further expand its profitability and help the global wealth franchise deliver beyond its end-2026 target of a greater than 30% underlying pre-tax margin. First, on service models. Our strong track record in serving sophisticated clients demonstrates the effectiveness of close collaboration across the organization. This is clearly reflected in the 21% year-over-year increase in Americas’ transactional revenues after we introduced joint coverage of GWM clients with IB markets specialists. Moreover, our experience tells us that the use of one or more of our specialized capabilities has a meaningful multiplier effect on revenue generation. We’re building a regionally-aligned, multi-disciplinary team approach, and extending this offering to a broader population of our existing ultra-high net worth clients to accelerate revenue growth. We’re rolling out this set-up immediately, and scaling it over the course of 2025. Second, on client mix. Going forward we intend to better balance our client base across wealth bands by increasing investment and penetration in the high net worth and core affluent segments to drive scale and profitability. To that end, we’re streamlining and automating product and content distribution and developing more tailored segment-specific solutions, leveraging our CIO and National Sales capabilities. In addition, we’re investing in our digitally-led advice model in the Wealth Advice Center to make it a more meaningful contributor to organic growth and to lower our cost to serve. By more than doubling our Advice Center staff, we aim to create further capacity to acquire and serve more clients and increase wallet with existing ones. In addition, the Wealth Advice Center becomes an effective pipeline for future FAs and a more cost- efficient way to scale our business. Another key aspect of our rebalancing efforts relates to enhancing our feeder channels. We intend to expand sources of asset acquisition by revising our referral and incentive structures while centralizing and investing in digital marketing. We’re also developing a comprehensive, integrated workplace wealth solution across equity and retirement plans, and financial planning and wellness. We believe a signature workplace wealth offering with state-of-the-art digital capabilities will serve as a highly effective client-lead generator, aligning with our priority to improve penetration across wealth bands. Third. On the capabilities side, we’re taking critical steps to build out a full suite of banking capabilities to enhance our ability to serve our clients and their business interests. This will help us expand our access to deposits, better balance our revenue mix, deepen client relationships, and, importantly, foster enduring engagement and connectivity between our clients and UBS. Expanding and enhancing our banking product offering requires that we obtain a National Charter, a multi- year process that is presently in full swing. Underpinning these initiatives and their success is a necessary operational re-alignment of the structure, performance culture and tech strategy in our Americas wealth franchise. So, fourth, effective January first, we simplified the organizational structure to drive greater collaboration, reduce duplication and create synergies, thereby contributing to improved productivity and efficiency. This includes regionally aligning our client-facing teams, reducing management layers and fostering clear accountability and faster decision-making. Recently, we also announced changes to our financial advisor compensation model. We aim to better align FA incentives with the strategic goals of the firm by rewarding net new money, new client acquisition and the broadening of existing client relationships, with a specific incentive for NII growth. While we designed these changes to incentivize greater production and ultimately higher compensation levels for advisors in full sync with our strategy, we may see a short-term rise in FA attrition, which is reflected in our pre-tax margin expectation for 2025. And finally, we’re implementing a strategic re-set in terms of how we invest and modernize our technology infrastructure. We’re now delivering new and advanced digital capabilities in a dynamic, modular fashion that make it easier for our clients and advisors to do business with, and on behalf of, UBS. This approach will enable more efficient execution of our technology roadmap with improved payback, which, together with an expanded tech budget, will create additional capacity to fund innovative solutions to improve advisor productivity and drive growth. We believe these actions, which are being decisively executed by our new leadership team, will drive margins to a mid-teens level by 2027, while positioning the Americas wealth business for long-term growth. A final word on providing more visibility to track our performance going forward. While the ultimate measure of our progress in the Americas is improvement in our regional pre-tax margin, beginning in 1Q, we’ll enhance our regional disclosure by breaking out revenue across the various categories and including prior period comparatives. country, our Swiss universal bank, with P&C at its core, showcases the power of close collaboration, creating value for clients. Even while absorbing NII and CLE headwinds, optimizing its balance sheet, and preparing for the client account migration, P&C alone contributed over one third of the Group’s 2024 underlying pre-tax profits. As we expect the headwinds I highlighted earlier to weigh on P&C’s returns in 2025, we aim to partially mitigate the effects of these challenges by growing non-NII revenues, while also striving to minimize client and asset outflows during the migration process. Moreover, the completion of the client account migration work will allow us to realize cost synergies and further invest in digital capabilities improving the client experience and efficiency of our platform. By 2026, we intend to fully capitalize on growth opportunities with no distractions. Our Swiss business will be uniquely positioned to offer exceptional value throughout the client lifecycle by delivering a comprehensive suite of services spanning wealth management, asset management and investment banking. Our primary focus will be on reinforcing our standing as the go-to bank for large corporates, entrepreneurs and emerging affluent clients with leading financing, asset servicing and wealth advice capabilities. This positioning, coupled with a more streamlined cost base, give us confidence in our ability to grow the P&C business at least as fast as Swiss GDP, while delivering a cost/income ratio of less than 50% and a pre-tax return on equity of near 20% by the end of 2026. Our strategic positioning, expanded product offering and enhanced regional scale in select markets are already supporting healthy momentum in Asset Management. Despite the impact of the integration, we saw 45 billion in net new money enter our platform in 2024 while we remain focused on continuing to capture opportunities where we have a differentiated and scalable offering. This includes our recently launched Unified Global Alternatives unit, which, with nearly 300 billion in invested assets, makes us a leading global player and top-5 limited partner. By combining our leading manager selection franchises across GWM and Asset Management, we can now offer our wealth management and institutional clients access to exclusive investment opportunities, while providing GPs with a single point of access to the full distribution power of UBS. Overall, with a focus on alternatives, improved traditional investment performance and customized client solutions at scale, we continue to expect positive net new money growth in 2025 while completing our fund shelf transition and platform consolidation. At the same time, we’re investing in our existing platform to build-out key capabilities, create cost efficiencies and support our AI strategy. We’ll also remain focused on realizing cost synergies from the integration and driving structural operational efficiencies from our strategic cost program. Together with further exits of non-strategic businesses, these efforts are expected to improve our profit margin in Asset Management to above 30% by the end of 2026. Over the last twelve months, we’ve generated more than half a billion of incremental underlying revenue in Global Banking and delivered record performance in Global Markets, including reaching record market share in Cash Equities. Looking forward, with favorable market conditions, the completion of the Credit Suisse integration, and earlier investments starting to pay off, we aim to enhance our IB’s returns in 2025. In Banking, we remain encouraged by our pipeline in M&A and LCM and our improved position in the Americas, which together are expected to support year-on-year revenue growth in 2025. I should note that, while there continues to be broad-based positive sentiment around the market backdrop, global fee pools in January were off by more than 20% year-on-year. Additionally, despite greater market activity in equity capital markets, productivity improvement visible in our own ECM business is more likely to yield meaningful revenue growth later in 2025 and into 2026, considering the timeline of our pipeline build. This said, with market share in the Americas over two times pre-acquisition levels, we remain confident in our ability to double Banking revenues in 2026 compared to our 2022 baseline. It’s also worth highlighting that our Investment Bank will be the only major player in the US and Europe implementing final Basel III regulations, and in particular FRTB. Upholding our capital-light business model despite this additional cost of capital, the IB remains committed to achieve its pre-tax return on equity ambition of 15% through the cycle while continuing to consume no more than 25% of the Group’s risk weighted assets. The performance delivered by the Non-core and Legacy team in 2024 contributed to a significant acceleration in our de-risking, cost saving and capital release plans. In particular, what we achieved during the last 6 quarters has fundamentally altered NCL’s balance sheet and risk position entering 2025, with RWA from its Credit, Securitized Products, Equities and Macro books reduced by over 70%. In addition to now being much smaller, and yielding less net carry, these books are broadly hedged against market moves, thereby effectively mitigating risks but also limiting revenue upside. Additionally, a significant portion of the funding costs associated with the overall portfolio relates to long-dated Holdco and Opco debt that Credit Suisse issued during its crisis. These instruments are prohibitively expensive to redeem prior to maturity, making them a sticky component of NCL’s costs, irrespective of funding needs. As a result, for full year 2025, we estimate NCL’s top line at around negative 500 million, mainly from funding costs, with revenues from remaining fair value positions and continued exits expected around zero. Excluded from this estimate is a gain of around 100 million expected in the first quarter from closing the sale of Credit Suisse’s US mortgage servicing company that we announced last year. We also anticipate NCL’s underlying operating expenses ex-litigation to continue to reduce over the course of 2025, averaging around 450 million per quarter. Accordingly, in 2025, NCL’s underlying pre-tax loss excluding litigation is expected to be around 2.2 billion, albeit with sequential improvements as expenses and consumption-based funding costs decrease. This compares to an underlying pre-tax loss in 2024 of around 800 million, inclusive of litigation releases. 2024’s performance benefitted from net carry income and our exiting positions at prices above book value, neither of which is expected to repeat at similar levels. Consequently, in 2025, NCL is expected to substantially weigh on returns year-over-year. Looking further out, we expect NCL to exit 2026 with less than 5% of Group RWA, consisting of less than 10 billion of market and credit risk. We also expect to exit 2026 with pre-tax loss of under 1 billion as the business continues its strong cost reduction trajectory. This is anticipated to consist of annualized operating expenses of around 750 million and annualized net funding costs of around 200 million. We then intend to run down NCL’s legacy operating expenses to a level below 250 million by the end of 2028 with funding costs tapering over an extended timeframe as legacy Credit Suisse funding matures. By the end of 2028, we forecast around 100 million of legacy funding costs per annum, fully running down by 2033. Our outlook for the run-off of NCL’s operational risk RWA for now remains in line with the trajectory we modeled under our internal method and disclosed previously. This reflects the fact that, unlike what is expected to eventually apply in the US, UK and across Europe, the 2025 Swiss implementation of the standardized approach imposes an internal loss multiplier well above 1, thereby resulting in significant RWA primarily for losses and matters we inherited from Credit Suisse. related regulatory measures. Our balance sheet for all seasons underpins our ability to consistently deliver for our clients and shareholders, while we ourselves maintain resilience through disciplined risk management and strong capital and liquidity levels. At the end of 2024, our Group total loss-absorbing capacity stood at 185 billion, with a going concern capital ratio of 17.6%, and, as mentioned, a CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%. We closed 2024 with AT1 capital at 3.3% of RWA. During the year, we successfully issued 3.5 billion in AT1 as we build towards our ambition and regulatory allowance of 4.3% of RWA. Given our progress to date and based on our projected 2025 funding needs, we expect our AT1 capital to remain at current levels through 2025 with new issuance offsetting potential calls. Gone-concern capital at year-end was 98 billion. As a reminder, while this is around 40 billion above the Group regulatory minimum, our binding constraint is UBS AG’s standalone requirement. Looking ahead, we’re targeting to bring down Group HoldCo to around 90 billion by the end of 2025 while still retaining resilient buffers over regulatory minimums. This target, which is expected to contribute substantial savings in funding costs, is based on the expectation that UBS AG standalone requirements will decrease as a result of further balance sheet reductions and the reorganization of remaining former Credit Suisse operating companies. UBS AG’s standalone CET1 capital ratio at year-end is estimated to be 13.5%. For the foreseeable future, we expect UBS AG to operate with a standalone CET1 capital ratio in the range of 12.5% to 13%, around 2 and a half points above the current regulatory minimum on a fully applied basis. This guidance factors in the effects of our ongoing integration efforts and also considers the prospect of settling Credit Suisse legacy litigation matters that could result in charges to the parent bank despite coverage at the Group level from PPA reserves established on the acquisition date. This target capital level also accounts for planned dividends and capital from subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter, 13 billion of capital was repatriated to the parent bank from its subsidiaries in the UK and the US. Of the total, 6 billion was paid up from UBS Americas Holding. The UK subsidiary, Credit Suisse International, repatriated 7 billion, with around 5 billion of additional distributions expected as we continue to unwind or transfer its positions, subject to customary regulatory approval. As Sergio mentioned, it’s important to note that we’ve planned for this distribution of capital from subsidiaries since the acquisition. As such, it forms part of our capital return ambitions while maintaining our target capital ratios at both the Group level and the parent bank. Therefore, broadly speaking, new capital requirements from Too Big To Fail imposed at the parent bank level would need to be funded by a higher retention of profits, consequently leading to an overshooting of capital at the Group level and resulting in a lower overall return on CET1 capital, all other things being equal. On to liquidity and funding. As we aim to balance efficiency with resiliency and safety, over the past 18 months, we’ve been maintaining our LCR above pre-acquisition levels. This approach was necessary to facilitate the phase-in of the more stringent Swiss liquidity requirements, which has now been completed, and to sustain a conservative liquidity profile during the initial stages of our balance sheet stabilization and integration process. Going forward, we expect to operate with an LCR below our 4Q24 level of 188%, reflecting continued efforts to manage towards a more efficient funding structure and reduced uncertainties associated with execution risk. Overall, our current funding strategy focuses on enhancing the quality of our liability portfolios while delivering cost efficiencies. This involves the right-sizing of our AT1 and TLAC stacks, disciplined deposit pricing, and active management of our liabilities across tenors and products to ensure a robust, diversified, and resilient funding profile. Coupled with significant balance sheet reductions achieved in 2024 and tighter spreads, these measures have already generated annual funding cost savings of 650 million, with an additional 350 million expected by 2026. which in Switzerland took effect on January 1st. We intend to report a day-1 impact of around 1 billion of incremental RWA, broadly neutral to our CET1 capital ratio, a result reflective of many months of intense, diligent preparation. This amount of RWA includes increases related to FRTB of 9 billion, decreases from credit-risk related adjustments of 1 billion, and a reduction in operational risk of 7 billion. Looking at our expectations through 2026. Over the next two years, we expect our Group RWA to increase by around 2 percent at constant FX from our 1 January 2025 pro-forma levels. This reflects around 15 billion higher RWA from business growth in the core businesses, with the offset driven by the ongoing run-off in NCL. Summing this up, we get to the same expected RWA level at the end of 2026 as we guided a year ago. However, with faster NCL reductions than foreseen, a lower than expected headwind from Basel III finalization, and accelerated benefits from our balance sheet optimization efforts, we increased capacity to support additional RWA growth in our core businesses to drive incremental revenues. In conclusion, we’re pleased with the progress and achievement made in 2024. And as we move forward, we’re confident in our ability to successfully deliver on our integration plans, meet our financial targets and drive long- term value creation for our shareholders. With that, let’s open up for questions.",['thanks again sergio offer detailed perspective financial outlook 2025 core businesses well positioned drive sustainable growth 2025 expect generate
