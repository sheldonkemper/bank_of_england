4Q24,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.
Very helpful. Thank you.",['hi good morning jeremy wanted ask capital know get question lot kind high-class dilemma growing capital base perspective earnings store so guess whats framework thinking opportunity cost sitting growing base capital high might let go versus patience waiting attractive deployment opportunities thank you thanks okay thanks jeremy follow-up think investment spend agenda year differ from say last year last couple years across lines business kind certainty return spectrum talked about kind efficiencies baked outlook well thanks helpful thank you'],John McDonald,"Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.
So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.
So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.
Sure. The truth is â€“ and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.
I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that â€“ the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.
And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.
Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.
But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.",['yeah good question john welcome back way so yeah noted points always make repeat them think way thinking right feel comfortable notion makes sense us nice store extra capital light current environment believe theres good chance moment get deploy better levels essentially whatever way current opportunities would suggest feels like correct kind strategic financial decision us said that studied quite extensively last six months debates would expect concluded enough enough excess given that would like excess grow here so think implications that given amount organic capital generation producing means unless find near term opportunities organic deployment otherwise means capital return buybacks else equal order arrest growth excess current plan although give caveat that know disclosure want get business guiding buybacks reserve right change trajectory time reason current thinking sure truth â€“ guess good thing themes remarkably consistent so seeing results kind high certainty investment choices across categories know well highlighted outlook page expenses continue main areas focus execution gets tweaked margin pursue different opportunities commercial & investment bank continue drilling analyzing relative pockets weakness might see go level two significantly strong share positions see aggregate level daniel always talked reds ambers behind greens thats embedded culture company everywhere continue analyzing iterating throw resources stuff that but broadly themes consistent think terms efficiency couple things say know well one is think efficiency generate company organic bau evergreen; happens every day teams everywhere sort part bottoms-up culture remains case top-down areas focus think go example technology starters putting lot effort improving sort ability software engineers productive development theres lot focus â€“ development environment them order enable productive else equal generates little bit efficiency also lot focus efficiency hardware utilization thats embedded well another thing thats worth noting recall that investor day talked probably reached peak modernization spend jamie always says always modernizing so fact gotten peak might come little bit still means going constantly modernizing but margin means inside tech teams theres little bit capacity gets freed focus features new product development on also sense form efficiency finally though would say look head count trajectory company last years grown lot good reasons contributed quite bit growth ability run company efficiently time quantum headcount growth well rate headcount growth believe else equal amount inefficiency introduced so year went budget cycle ask people margin try support growth company living within means headcount front going try run things important exceptions highlight second roughly flat head count lead people generating internal efficiencies get creative teams consider efficient ways things obvious exceptions ongoing areas high certainty investment growth so obviously branches bankers on also critical non-negotiable areas risk control like cyber whatever independent risk management needs ensure running company safely thats thinking efficiency current moment'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO
4Q24,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Who's your successor? So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now? All right.

And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so â€“ and what was your first question again? Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet.

4Q24,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks. Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you â€“ since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased.

I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it. Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular.",['hey jim mean obviously something thinking lot could go pretty deep rabbit holes speculating different parts framework could evolve really think thats productive right now let make attempt answer question so backing second read jamies quotes consistent saying company long time want coherent rational holistically-assessed regulatory framework allows banks job supporting economy reflexively anti-bank default answer every question everything capital liquidity uses data balances obvious goal share safe sound banking system actually recognizing banks play critical role supporting growth hope get that also it aspects supervisory framework get little bit less bureaucratic little less adversarial little bit substantive margin management focus time things matter most so whether capital goes up down stays flat really complicated basel iii endgame also g-sib also number factors thats keep hammering away importance holistically properly right analysis takes time it yeah good question think given significant improvement business sentiment general optimism there might expected see pickup loan growth really seeing that particularly think thats negative think probably explained combination wide-open capital markets many larger corporates accessing capital markets healthy balance sheets small businesses maybe residual caution maybe pockets industries aspects policy uncertainty might facing making little bit cautious otherwise would executing near-term but see new year brings current optimism starts getting tested reality one way other maybe materializes tangible improvements things one way other actually see come c&i loan growth particular'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO
4Q24,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that â€“ somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by â€“ to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer? And just a follow-up question â€“ a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?",['yes hi good morning wanted follow questions capital maybe ask of jeremy crosscurrents terms denominator so look third quarter regulatory data g-sib surcharge score would imply score would put range 5% g-sib so obviously understand print â€“ somewhere near score end year g-sib surcharge goes â€“ 5% 50 basis points two years one day now time around holidays get press release federal reserve lawsuit banks terms transparency looks like transparency going focused perhaps improved soon years stress test so think definition excess right part like 157% clearly huge number so think returns going forward definition excess also continues shift so think crosscurrents terms two big components clearly one g-sib surcharge stress capital buffer follow-up question â€“ follow-up johns line questioning placeholder think said trying arrest growth cet1 now assume anything need organic growth dividend obligations terms 157% bought back company think about know want predict buyback sort placeholder think return back shareholders form repurchase'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore. Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.",['right erika okay tempting many rabbit holes deep lets try address much great length first all g-sib so yes high print third quarter normal seasonality third quarter fourth quarter so current view g-sib number estimate quite confident wound comfortably 5% bucket result normal seasonality actually relatively quiet december terms types year-end things sometimes create pressures various types less might otherwise expected terms typical seasonal patterns so much see there obvious point also even existing proposed g-sib rule obviously little bit hung up smaller buckets recalibration on even sort obvious would mattered one way other but anyway now managing current rules normal seasonality took us back 5% okay mentioned lawsuit think thing say happy see clear recognition part fed many things talking long time terms transparency volatility non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated ccar process needs improvement so thats great think speak industry bodies actual litigants seems me read said publicly press releases much anything preserving rights light statute limitations deadlines coming up so lets hope see significant progress front then taking step back high level really asking is core view about think probably best way think lens numerator actually core view just sake argument assume modest growth normalized amount economic denominator like actual need capital organically likely additional numerator needed function environment way increasingly thinking different scenario analysis like flat numerator 5% numerator 10% numerator 20% numerator guess could versions world numerators little less guessing central case comparing projected capital amount number determine excess point out 157% think actual quantum numerator something like $275 billion pretty much reasonable lens ton excess concluded need grow anymore yeah quoted capital hierarchy conclusion flows naturally statement want arrest growth excess'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO

4Q24,"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen? Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? Okay. Thank you.",['good morning seems like guys backed view materially over-earning net interest income higher rate environment thats expected now also partly different view deposit pricing specifically consumer side think assumed would reprice bit seen okay separately strategic question theres reports expanding consumer banking business globally guess want push really seen banks successful way obviously approach kind coming position strength leading digitally guess wondering like worth it enough upside justify maybe increased regulatory execution risk global consumer banking okay thank you'],Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.",['yeah good question matt guess maybe let try frame couple different perspectives so one hand right look nii guidance giving you including notion subject yield curve panning line current forwards which know one thing know happen want assume something assume forwards sort telling might return sequential growth back half year again based current assumptions else equal could draw conclusion means overearning narrative longer applicable think take big step back historical standards difference policy rate weighted average rate paid consumer deposits remains quite elevated variety reasons subject fact end deposit pricing always going response competitive environment experience field current structure yield curve that time anyway math thats see think thats truly truly truly sustainable cycle unclear guess cross bridge come it now outlook coming year gotten closer normalized nii normalized credit yeah worth noting nii ex markets year-on-year theres normalization there yeah think kind answered questions sense like talked lot first launched initiative think comparison players apt current moment thats say like special anything strategy different different moment new initiative obviously risk-free going pretty well pointing obvious think worth it it obviously considered risks opportunities associated decision one strategic initiatives get scrutinized quite aggressively management processes'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO
4Q24,"Hi. Good morning.
Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan â€“ but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to â€“ could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are â€“ where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody â€“ every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.
Thank you.",['hi good morning guys hear okay right want make sure hear me great call first congratulations great quarter great call lot robust questions here like else ask heres question think nii outlook highlighted nim pressure loan â€“ basically balance increasing here right maybe could speak â€“ could help understand order drivers qt going away deposits going up punch securities loan growth inflecting place franchise see loan growth opportunities inflection coming year lastly think comments around got green market share number one got yellow got red places maybe cant see could help us understand yellows reds â€“ are scattered everybody â€“ every single business one others and therefore opportunities balance sheet fee-generative thats kind like discuss minute thanks thank you'],Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Betsy.
Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be â€“ it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite.
Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies.
The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.

thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is.

That's fascinating, Gerard. Iâ€™ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.

3Q24,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut?

And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.

All right. Thanks a lot.",['hey good morning so jeremy highlighted full year nii guidance implies sizable drop q4 nii ex markets 6% so maybe discuss largest drivers sequential decline including initial thoughts deposit behavior pricing since 50 basis point cut since related throw follow-up question realize forward curve moving around lot since dan brought month ago frame thinking nii trajectory 2025 thanks right thanks lot'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact â€“ that we're expecting â€“ is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.

In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.

And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.

And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances.

So, maybe, I'll â€“ well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.

But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.

We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.

Thanks.",['yeah sure jim try answer questions together best ability so sit today biggest single driver sequential decline is fact â€“ expecting â€“ is fact yield curve so yield curve changed little bit since daniel made comments conference earlier quarter significantly terms deposit balances obviously another important factor light fed starting cutting cycle feels us like right now mentioned prepared remarks consumer pretty much trough right speak look yield-seeking behavior come quite bit thats longer much headwind else equal look checking account balances pretty stable time see indication consumers kind done spending cash buffers thats kind supportive consumer deposit balances context relevant point cd mix where rate cuts coming expect cd balances price pretty high betas probably cd mix actually peaking around now move wholesale actually already seeing little bit growth there combine sort increasing view many people market likely end qt announced sometime soon thats also little bit supportive deposit balances so maybe â€“ well guess also asked little bit next year so guess one thing say right sequential increase nii quarter and may recall investor day said chance would see sequential increases followed sequential declines people avoid kind drawing conclusion hit trough happens thats essentially exactly seeing now sit now given yield curve assuming yield curve materializes obviously see pretty clear picture sequential declines nii ex markets trough may happening sometime middle next year point combination balances card revolve growth factors return us sequential growth obviously guessing pretty far future give formal guidance stuff next quarter think gives better framework work with thanks'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
3Q24,"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts? Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.",['hi good morning jeremy you want ask expenses light comments daniel made recently noting consensus expense forecast next year looked little bit light believe time $94 billion adjust one-timers year would suggest core expense base thats $90 billion pretty healthy step-up expenses know always strong commitment discipline around investment want better understand incremental dollars deployed investments prioritized particular looking next year thank color quick follow-up me drilling nii appears redeployed fair amount cash excess reserves fed securities saw yield expand encouraging despite pressure long end sofr contraction quarter hoping could speak appetite extend duration environment know aversion past anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity amid expectation deeper rate cuts well said well thank much taking questions'],Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII. Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one. Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers... Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are. Thanks, Steve.",['sure good question agree numbers agree way normalized year one-time type significant items also consensus daniel made comments it would also remind nii comments time consensus year $915 billion next year $90 billion implying time sequential decline $15 billion felt decline big enough made comments made happy expand that anyway expenses yeah start sake argument base $90 billion obviously inflation normalizing obviously always trying generate efficiencies offset inflation but said assume 3% sake argument base thats billion dollars right gates working against thats one thing thing continued execute growth strategies year theres insignificant amount annualization cant quite see fourth quarter numbers seasonality incentive comp strip out would see probably sequential increases annualization additional headwind thing thats worth noting expect fees volume-related businesses grow next year else equal would come higher expense loading assemble those goes long way explain sort consensus number slightly $94 billion seemed light terms priorities investments really nothing changed like strategy changed strategy changed plans changed kind executing long-term perspective always had would note relative nii obviously third quarter now fourth quarter old days used give guidance investor day late february give formal expense guidance next quarter both well expenses nii next quarter especially expenses middle budget cycle right probably little less visibility margin nii yeah sure extending duration steve know obviously think important say else equal extending duration change expected nii assume policy rate follows forward right so point one point two curve remains inverted even believe policy rate follows forwards extending right actually headwind short-term nii like consideration us either way think thats worth saying broader audience quite different situation numbers yeah think question extending duration really managing duration right now couple things say so obviously lot different versions duration one number disclose ear 10-q comes out see number little bit lower come $28 billion $21 billion current estimates correct thats number reasons passive active choices extend duration little bit end choice manage extend duration really balancing volatility nii protecting company extreme scenarios either side right now wanted extend result different factors certainly could capacity inside portfolio now comfortable are thanks steve'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
3Q24,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.
Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?
And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.
And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.
And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?
Thank you.",['first question thank much answering nii questions far jeremy guess another follow-up imagine daniel said said stage september everyone trying figure over/under net interest income next year maybe two-part first question second inspired jamie said number one nii expected 6% sequentially fourth quarter think year-over-year 2025 consensus 4% new level sounds like consensus still room come down based forward curve jeremy could little bit worse year-over-year fourth quarter sequential rate said jamie noted idea curve going look like right gyrated much think curve better jpmorgan cuts short end steepness less cuts little bit flatter curve ask second question and jamie completely understand frustration fair long-term shareholders really care whether $87 billion $85 billion right care return equity end mean insane much capital generate quarter 72 basis points quarter so beyond standard boilerplate questions going get buyback organic growth yada yada dividend increases think jpmorgan deploying capital mean world generally oyster right dominant already could use capital enhance business again beyond boilerplate conversation always get every quarter shareholders think thinking opportunities deploy capital thank you'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question.
So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark.
Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.
So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolver resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.
Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.
Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas.
So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end.
So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind â€“ would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",['right okay threw curve ball end there erika expecting end question let answer beginning question also answer end question see current 2025 consensus nii ex markets currently $87 billion obviously lower conference earlier quarter happy see move little bit line us still looks little toppy definitely ballpark consists of already mentioned previously sort expect nii trough sometime middle year kind assemble parts got fourth quarter run rate got sequential declines got trough middle year got rough ballpark full year imagine trough probably little lower numbers extent growth revolver resumes back half year deposit balances ongoing tailwind card revolve although tailwind little bit less might otherwise thought mean sorry little bit less year still tailwind obviously mix things play different ways point out knows yield curve wind doing current assumptions current yield curve remembering third quarter now kind early thats think good okay question ear so things say there so already mentioned comes out show number around $21 billion important thing say is know experience rate cycle empirical ear meaningfully higher modeled ear disclose main reason retail deposit betas have actuality lower modeled deposit betas starting point kind adjust ear number bigger reported number reasons actually theres nuances around dollar non-dollar sensitivity interact theres question little bit front-end versus back-end so see actually front-end ear gotten smaller ear back-end so definitely case that else equal steeper curve better us think would also say kind empirical versus theoretical adjustment disproportionately front-end therefore order answer question would say yes want steeper curve fed cut whats currently yield curve definitely margin context next years numbers headwind â€“ would headwind us remain asset sensitive fed cuts'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
3Q24,"Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question.

So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clientsâ€™ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.

All right. Thanks for all that.",['hi thanks much glad jamie say say thats answer question seen couple banks entering partnerships alternative managers seen limited loan growth years now market-related also; limited flows fixed income funds yet plenty growth private credit general one best asset managers planet view less dominant things private credit maybe could talk things working thats narrow view ability serve parts clientsâ€™ lending needs public markets public lending side thanks right thanks that'],Glenn Schorr,"Analyst, Evercore ISI","Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that.

And so first and foremost â€“ Iâ€™m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.

Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue.

We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of itâ€™s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to â€“ $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners.

Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have â€“ I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing.

And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place.

So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete.

And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis?

3Q24,"Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines? And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over-quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q.

So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing. So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning â€“ I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically.

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to â€“ and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.
Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways.
Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.
Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.
And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.
But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",['yeah ebrahim way would frame risk reality always emphasized businesses operate extremely competitive environment applies â€“ competitive environment limited competing banks traditional financial institutions extends consumer space fintechs market making space obviously increasingly extending types firms referring to firms are many cases also clients thats type dynamic see example private credit space discussed before theres question ecosystem changing got new competitors got changes market structure new dynamics business innovating adjusting making sure prepared compete traditional ways new ways course ways bank hinders ability that one arguments made going back capital liquidity regulations come impact kind us capital markets ecosystem end view world worked well current construct long time activities inside regulated perimeter robust participation unregulated capital various sorts world activity gets pushed outside bank market makers meaningful change structure untested unclear would want that cautioned thats intent regulations intentional well-studied meantime going adjust compete best ability given constraints current rule set yeah good question ebrahim think kind answered question words like argument repo spike saw end quarter indication maybe market approaching lowest comfortable level reserves thats heavily speculated about recognizing number probably higher driven evolution firms liquidity requirements opposed traditional measures side point another reason important look whole framework holistically think regulatory response events two springs ago want types spikes raises questions readiness deploy types disruptions albeit one relatively minor case put together would seem add weight notion maybe qt wound seems increasingly consensus thats going get announced point fourth quarter point play view through residual headwind system-wide deposit growth gets removed thats one reasons feel probably trough deposit balances level of'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Betsy.
Yeah.
Yeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?
Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular â€“
â€“ that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is â€“ one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point.
You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.
No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion.

3Q24,"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits?

Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer. Thanks, Saul.

2Q24,"Hi. Good morning, Jeremy.
So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?
No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?
Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.",['hi good morning jeremy so wanted start question capital given indications fed considering favorable revisions basel iii endgame gsib surcharge calculations know pushing time evaluate different capital scenarios revisions material enough could support higher normalized rotce firm versus 17% target so might impact inform appetite buybacks going forward need apologize jeremy really helpful perspective maybe follow-up nii consistent flagging risk related nii overearning especially light potential deposit attrition well repricing headwinds second quarter see least moderation repricing pressures deposit balances also resilient seasonally weak quarter deposit growth so given evidence deposit pressures appear abating see potential nii normalizing higher think level could ultimately terms stabilization understood jeremy thanks much taking questions'],Steven Chubak,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, Steve.
Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.
Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.
So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.
So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.
On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.
And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.
Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.
So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.

2Q24,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?
Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamieâ€™s not there, you canâ€™t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how youâ€™re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?

So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed â€“ not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.
I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro formaâ€™d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.
Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice.
So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.

Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out. Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still â€“ it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all kind of hangs together in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story.

2Q24,"Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front.

Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it. Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.

2Q24,"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?
Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.
Got it. Okay. Thank you for the details.",['good morning wondering elaborate essentially math behind rotce high 20% normalized 17% obviously pointed overearning nii guess question is go 20% 17% so consumer deposit costs components could help frame us yeah really helpful chart one follow-up yield curve effects guess mean right yield curve inverted maybe still breathing impact that kind longer term expect little bit steepness curve would think would help mean that thank you got it okay thank details'],Matt O'Connor,"Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's â€“ we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.
And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII.
And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.
Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of â€“ I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing.
But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of â€“ many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.

2Q24,"Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the overearning narrative? Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that? Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away?

I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative. I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame. Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like, to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So, the number has a range around it, obviously. So, it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate.

2Q24,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.
So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.
All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.",['hi jeremy hi jeremy so want ask one drill-down question 2q related dollar amount buybacks do think press release right slide deck $49 billion common stock net repurchases so question is whats governor much every quarter and mean understand function of okay much organically grow even that get organic growth nice movement there organic growth much earn want buy back earnings thinking repurchase volume looking like time remember investor day whole debate around want buy back stock are right so get question investors quite bit thinking think right amount here right thank you jeremy appreciate it'],Betsy L. Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Betsy.
Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.
But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way.
You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about â€“ Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and thatâ€™s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and itâ€™s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.
And beyond that, what youâ€™re left with is my answer to Steveâ€™s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when weâ€™re generating these types of earnings and thereâ€™s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we donâ€™t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. Theyâ€™re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. Itâ€™s just that we donâ€™t feel that now is the right time.

2Q24,"Hi, Jeremy. How are you?
Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances then on-interest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when theyâ€™ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what youâ€™re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?
Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.

Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadnâ€™t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits?
And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So, big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.
Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not â€“ we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.

As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.

2Q24,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?

Right. Okay. Great. Thanks.",['oh hey good morning maybe one last question sort deploying excess capital seems like two primary ways organically would trading book loan book so maybe two questions there one trading assets 20% year-over-year leaning function demand opportunities grow that then secondly outside card loan demand quite weak thoughts seeing change demand thinking loan demand going forward thanks right okay great thanks'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are â€“ gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning.
Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here.
And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.
Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that.
And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend â€“ steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.
But in the meantime, there's also â€“ it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the â€“ on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now.
So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.

Thanks for the color.",['hey good morning jeremy speak trends seeing respect deposit migration quarter theres change seen migration start slow not okay follow-up sort bigger picture nii sort biggest driver outlook migration forward curve balances sounds like migration curious hear thoughts biggest drivers upside downside right okay great thanks color'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where â€“ even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.

Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out â€“ not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're â€“ if they â€“ you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape â€“ we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just â€“ I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's â€“ one thing to project it today based on what â€“ not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history. Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well thatâ€™s the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect â€“ including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we â€“ people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will â€“ the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.",['would say consumer customers fine unemployment low home prices up stock prices up amount income need service debt still kind low extra money lower-income folks running â€“ running out normalizing see credit normalizing little bit course higher-income folks still money still spending it so whatever happens customer pretty good shape â€“ â€“ go recession pretty good shape businesses good shape look today confidence up order books up profits up caution people results lot fiscal spending lot qe et cetera so really know whats going happen also want look year look two years three years geopolitical effects oil gas much fiscal spending actually take place elections et cetera so good shape â€“ okay right now mean okay road look inflection point okay current time always true true 1972 true time it so â€“ cautious side people feel confidence levels that necessarily stop inflection point so everything okay today got prepared range outcomes are thing want point out questions interest rates yield curves nii credit losses â€“ one thing project today based â€“ think economic scenarios generally accepted economic scenario generally accepted rate cuts fed numbers always wrong ask question things happen like higher rates modest recession et cetera numbers change think us surprised happens think chance happening higher people know outcome want guess outcome never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point economy literally life history yeah put two buckets okay first all fine got good reserves office think multifamily fine jeremy give detail want think real estate theres two pieces rates go up think yield curve whole yield curve fed funds 10-year bond rate goes 2% assets assets every asset planet including real estate worth 20% less well obviously creates little bit stress strain people roll finance more thats true real estate true everybody happens leveraged loans real estate effect second thing the happen happens strong economy well thats bad real estate people hiring throwing things financial assets happens stagflation well thatâ€™s worst case sudden going vacancies going companies cutting back going less leases affect â€“ including multifamily filter whole economy way â€“ people really experienced since 2010 so put back mind important interest rates important recession important things stay today kind soft landing seems embedded marketplace everyone â€“ real estate muddle through obviously idiosyncratic different cities different types b versus buildings that people muddle through muddle higher rates recession would tough lot folks real estate if fact happens'],Jamie Dimon,CEO & Co.

So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the â€œwhat are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capitalâ€_x009d_ and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind. Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going to be.",['right so interesting framing question erika so think pretty consistent over-earning right so obviously one major area over-earning deposit margin especially consumer thats sort expecting sequential declines nii talked compressing deposit margins increases weighted average rate paid so think thats probably single biggest source of lets call it excess earnings currently also heard jamie say over-earning credit mean wholesale charge-offs particularly low builds that so current run rate bit less clear extent earning card course charge-offs close normalized essentially go extended period charge-offs low historical standards although coupled nii also low historical standards so bottom line perspective entirely clear net was broadly really deposit margin thats biggest single factor over-earning narrative embedded question think little bit â€œwhat thinking 17% cet1 light current level capitalâ€_x009d_ talk investor day hoping would interesting things say investor day light potential updates basel iii endgame given single important factor 17% much denominator expansion see basel iii endgame rate going actually know much investor day might much say except reiterate said past that whatever is going good returns absolute terms good relative terms optimize seek reprice adjust various ways best ability given structure rule proposed least lot cannot optimized away so base case think headwind yeah sorry erika so quick things this one lets focus nii ex total nii so anchor $89 billion number two want math like changes average funds rate rest year multiply times ear like guest like good approach any would remind $900 billion deposits paying practically zero small changes make big difference got factors got impact qt deposit balances et cetera et cetera et cetera so want make sure get precise here giving best guess based series assumptions going going be'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

When you talked about, we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with â€“ as it relates to M&A on like go-no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks. Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.",['thanks good morning jeremy wondering could expand little bit one prepared comments talked about hopes expectations investment banking pipeline continued move along obviously saw good movement ecm dcm lag advisory talk that mentioned like potential cautiousness around election hearing corporate side sponsor side â€“ relates m&a like go-no-go type feel conversation levels then thinking need kickstart another good level ipo activity ecm markets thanks got it guess stick theme capital markets surprising see little bit tougher comp ficc think guys kind indicated maybe flattish fee pool reasonable place know thats impossible guide on just maybe talk dynamics terms activity across fixed income equities business feel like type environment where given lingering uncertainty rates clients either engaged less engaged terms positioning portfolios thanks'],Ken Usdin,"Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor. And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because of it's knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said, I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter. Happy to see momentum in announced M&A. A little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic. A little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here. Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, â€œOh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?â€_x009d_ For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that â€“ those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

So Iâ€™m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because heâ€™s at a leadership off-site. Thatâ€™s why he was here remote. So, I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, thatâ€™s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we donâ€™t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. Well, I think one of the things about Payments businesses is that, in some sense they are â€“ I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession. We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that.

1Q24,"Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average.

In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.

So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like â€“ into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So â€“ that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the â€“ while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some â€“ or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.

1Q24,"Hi, Jeremy. Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well? Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business? Appreciate the color.

How are you doing? Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here. Thanks, Gerard.",['hey gerard doing right so think whats true spreads general broadly credit spreads including secondary markets extent leverage lending space exceptionally tight so sure thats reversed little bit last days broadly throughout quarter really seen credit spreads tighten quite bit even see little bit oci quarter losses oci wouldve higher rates meaningfully offset tighter credit spreads portfolio broadly sort keeping big run-up saw equity markets general sort bullish tone saw quite bit credit spread tightening secondary markets that think manifested little bit leverage lending space normal way does theres lot competition among providers revenue pool start see little bit loosening terms always makes us little bit concerned past going well prepared lose share space like terms never compromise structure there so seeing little bit that think that away leverage lending space broader c&i space moment months ago think small part result banks generally anticipating challenging capital environment sort disciplining little bit lending seeing little bit widening actually corporate lending spreads know trend like survived last weeks little bit hard observe case would say broadly dynamics tension people trying careful balance sheets fact overall asset prices conditions quite supportive secondary market credit spreads rallied lot right yeah mean think tension us provider secured financing portions private credit private equity community talking different parts capital structure recognize compete areas clients areas thats part franchise good level narrowly private credit interesting observe whats going there would say us strategy much product agnostic actually much like oh private credit syndicated lending its take good stuff takes is stuff always good individual silo so need underwriting skill structuring skill origination distribution secondary trading risk appetite credit analysis capabilities really good it increasingly see actually that see us little bit private credit space gets bigger starts make sense actually bring co-lenders sort big enough deals without undue concentration risks mean even capital may want concentration risk so funny way private credit space becomes little bit like syndicated lending space time syndicated lending space influenced little bit private credit unitranche structures gets pushed little bit private credit direction terms like speed execution aspects business works so watching it competitive dynamics interesting certainly theres pressure areas really think overall value proposition competitive position second none looking forward future here thanks gerard'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
1Q24,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question. As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question. Alright. Thank you.",['good morning couple questions first republic acquisition us obviously thought would homerun glad see jamie dimon validated annual letter look first quarter annualizes $27 billion $28 billion $2 billion jamie published letter know want extrapolate that remind us sort cost savings still that quarter see expenses come $800 million $900 million then secondly offset accretion becomes less less thats want extrapolate $27 billion $28 billion so thats first question quick follow-up next homeruns going come from strategic beyond jpmorgan probably going regional bank failures whether year next year opportunities pick up seeing that private equity family offices setting participate next round bank failures mnuchins buying nycb clearly create platform rollups failed banks family offices filed shelf registrations bank holding companies whose specific purpose buy failed banks so think opportunities going competed away private credit part that think regulators going view private credit different party less attractive party versus bank takeovers failed banks so thats question alright thank you'],Charles W. Peabody,"Analyst, Portales Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.

Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the overearning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year. Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply.

Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been â€“ a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels. Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger.

4Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that? Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.",['hey good morning maybe follow different way nii question deposits you jeremy discuss assumptions reprice migration thoughts then layering get six cuts start change dynamic around growth deposits thinking that right okay thanks lot'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates.

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling â€“ obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios â€“ is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world. Yeah. So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no â€“ no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets.

Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking â€“ why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that. A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook.

4Q23,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks. Okay. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here. Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach?

Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah â€“ and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology â€“ which I think is interesting â€“ that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here. Sure. Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that â€“ I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.

Yeah. Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there. Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's â€“ the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So â€“ and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does. Thanks, Gerard.",['hey gerard yeah gerard wish answer interesting practice always use forward curve outlook thats whats there yeah good question gerard mean think heard jamie talk lot qt obviously big focus one complicating elements current environment think math math sense qt else equal withdrawing system-wide deposits last six months year thats offset hopefully reduction size rrp so thats supportive system-wide deposits go 2024 rrp lower levels may little bit less tailwind also case know theres â€“ markets expectation qt going start slowing point year â€“ still reasonable levels reserves cushion rrp so thats part reason outlook deposits modestly down shrinkage system-wide deposits maybe partially offset belief take share but also think second half year going interesting watch terms fed does thanks gerard'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
4Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in â€“ how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM? Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more? Great, thank you.",['hey good morning thanks taking questions lot talk capital markets rebound noted starting year healthy pipeline could give us color seeing rate â€“ change rate environment changing conversations across m&a ecm dcm great flip side c&i spoke lower revolver utilization muted demand would take rebound think accelerates rates come room slow even capital markets open even more great thank you'],Manan Gosalia,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and â€“ well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive. Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a â€“ I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.

4Q23,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate? Anything specific on asset-backed?

Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.

4Q23,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or 
 I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there. Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion.

Peabody,"Analyst, Portales Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company. Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of 
 that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it.

Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting â€“ continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But thatâ€™s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, weâ€™re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment. Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",['sure thanks john think themes pretty much seen prior quarters so talked little bit press call trying little bit cautious recognizing think current levels sustainable think reprice pockets degree maybe tiering whatever point future and course happened yet year thats one factor meantime cd strategy working well getting â€“ continue get good feedback field capturing money motion seeing sort internal migration associated slow increase deposit rate paid result cd migration thatâ€™s sort working would hoped everything kind playing according plan would say terms higher-for-longer think means continue upward pressure deposit pricing internal migration possibly moderate effects end always say weâ€™re going price products function competitive market environment yeah think would say predicting higher rates know jamie something say here believe prepared thats position time and course thats produced good results continue try position neither significantly higher rates significant lower rates present particularly large challenge company probably margin still little bit biased slightly higher rates but keep mind modeling duration balance sheet higher rates extend duration rather shorten duration deposit side factor well'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.
Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.
I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.
Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that donâ€™t affect revenue and donâ€™t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity thatâ€™s shareholder value destructive but it wonâ€™t be costless.
A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.

3Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?
That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?
Got it. Thank you.
Yeah, no. I got that. I got the trillion dollars. Yup, thanks.
BPI did, yeah. Thank you.",['hey good morning first question jeremy credit think mentioned reserves release tied change central scenario talk us remind us central scenario today changed terms fundamentally credit like seeing softness either consumer commercial side thats helpful going back details laid basel endgame maybe philosophical side think jamie speaking last month said expect changes time make everything makes sense terms pushback falling deaf ears shareholder perspective resigned fact going see towards worst-case outcome play level sort meeting middle road thing gets finalized got it thank you yeah no got that got trillion dollars yup thanks bpi did yeah thank you'],Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process.
And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.
Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like â€“ the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.
So anyway, the point is it's long, itâ€™s complicated, itâ€™s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.

3Q23,"Thank you. And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming? Thank you.",['thank you loan growth side industry loan growth slowed significantly year demand seeing loan growth across different categories know might early talk next year directionally think loan growth given cycle higher capital requirements coming thank you'],Ryan Kenny,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.",['yeah sure loan growth story pretty consistent saying year weve course seen robust loan growth card thats coming spending growth normalization revolving balances look forward still optimistic that probably little bit muted normalization period auto also seen pretty robust loan growth recently function sort slightly competitive pricing side industry little bit slow raise rates lost share previously thats come back now generally supply chain situation better thats supported look forward there little bit muted think generally wholesale loan growth story going driven economic environment depending believe soft landing mild recession landing slightly lower slightly higher loan growth case would expect relatively muted and course home lending remains fairly constrained rates market conditions also think true across board managing things actively mentioned light basel iii may change originations change retain'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
3Q23,"Good morning, Jeremy. How are you?
Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?
Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?
Great. Thank you.",['good morning jeremy you jeremy guys put really strong rotce number 22% quarter dive different segments really jumps us 40% ex-first republic roe consumer & community banking know jamie talked over-earning credit get that view fintechs nonbank competitors supposed pick away everybodys market share guys put great numbers here whats drivers behind roe even take credit over-earning out whats driving business profitability high levels good follow up ties answer deposit margin consumer earlier comments jamie internal debate inside jpmorgan migration rates going higher funding side non-interest-bearing deposits think around 28% total deposits slightly 26% guys back 2018 2019 pre-pandemic expectation going see non-interest-bearing deposits go interest-bearing or repricing interest-bearing deposits folks inside jpmorgan little cautious net interest income number great thank you'],Gerard Cassidy,"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Gerard.
Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs.
And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.
Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure â€“ I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now.
But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",['hey gerard yeah gerard say couple things there first credit also deposit margin right talk over-earning nii disproportionate amount coming consumer franchise reasons talked about but would also point sometimes like word over-earning right now customers happy cds broader answer question able effectively really comes back decade two decade long history investing future recognizing theres holistic value proposition includes branches app online services entire suite products services around enterprise drives engagement customer loyalty seeing benefits now although complacent competition still there fintechs still there know need continue investing preserve value also true particular circumstances current rate credit environment mean earnings little bit normal core franchise extremely robust yeah good question gerard think little bit bigger picture that sure â€“ get questions good question sure reported interest-bearing non-interest-bearing split best lens look couple reasons first like wholesale retail got amount non-interest-bearing wholesale thats part ecr product see dynamics play out consumer world savings paying relatively low-rate paid cross-checking savings migration dynamics probably different right now course even within consumer across consumers small businesses got slightly different dynamics terms people manage operating balances would tend zoom little bit see holistic answer thats driven internal migration checking savings cds ecr interest-bearing wholesale potential response rate environment competitive environment overall level system-wide deposits terms product level reprice may may happen moments future'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
3Q23,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re -asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for-longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter? Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns? Got it. Thank you.",['hi good morning jeremy first question you sort maybe -asking question different way new guide net interest income year would imply exit run rate $229 billion fourth quarter think dynamics higher-for-longer one hand fixed rate assets continue reprice other even asked lot deposit dynamics could continue creep higher think puts takes think relative exit rate $229 billion fourth quarter thank you second question maybe zooming basel iii endgame impacts clearly complex overly complex completely agree unnecessary point backward looking guess complex fact generated 75 basis points cet1 quarter rwas down guess question is understand public advocacy process hear loud clear terms could harm terms pricing main street dislocating pipes american capital markets jpmorgan change natural return profile 17% jamie know lingered little bit 14% barclays september end day feels like portfolio managers jpmorgan cycle basel iii endgame really harm natural earnings power returns got it thank you'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex. Markets and we're kind of saying... Yeah. Isn't that what I meant to say? Oh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway... So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion, so that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us. Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",['yeah so erika think simple answer question believe fourth quarter exit number equates $90 billion run rate ex markets kind saying yeah meant say oh hear that okay anyway call $90 billion run rate exit rate basis saying think something bit normal closer $80 billion thats one building block underneath that think one thing thats interesting actually percentage deposits cds increases sort balance internal migration betas rate volume little bit less binary little bit smoother look type stuff model migration balances product level reprice get lower zero bound 0% cd mix world things get little bit smoother would say overall interesting watch that obviously one important things us company right everything manage it also worth remembering big picture point client franchise often said focused primary bank relationships lose last cycle planning lose cycle thats sort long-term focus means us yeah okay thats good question erika think theres couple pieces there let take important piece first 17% cycle target keeping light basel iii endgame proposal so short answer going change number today look disclosed 25% increase capital start acknowledging major headwind returns simple terms talk earnings power returns two different things right little bit pedantic numerator denominator here okay say numerator change dilute numerator increased capital thats significantly lower return number would say thats probably lower bound terms impact basel iii endgame couple reasons one is hoping changes two is rule final seek reprice places can different consumer wholesale product level relationship level hopefully mitigate course flip side thats cost getting passed real economy thats part point made lowering availability products services lending may opportunities costless optimization personally little bit pessimistic those surprised points past see finally yeah may stop certain things may exit things but necessarily assume thats going lot preserve returns 17% thats going exiting things shareholder-destructive necessarily producing much higher returns know mean thats that part question implicitly talking organic capital generation think important separate impacts economy impacts long-term returns ability meet requirements course jamie always says jpmorgan going fine building lot capital managing capital conservatively able build necessary capital order achieve on-time early compliance always strive do really particular bearing question long-term return target impacts real economy'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points.

Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point... For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what â€“ in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything. Yeah. Now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference we said, I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through the budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin there's going to be a little bit of upward pressure. Yeah, this is all now including First Republic.

3Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?
Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?
Right. That's helpful. Thanks.",['hey good morning jeremy think theres receptivity among regulators regarding double counting operational risk think alluded earlier markets business theres clearly double counting market risk trading book receptivity okay change talked potential negative impact liquidity markets business specifically jpm pulling certain businesses type event comment thered fewer providers liquidity less scaled players exit maybe thats almost equal market share gain opportunity jpmorgan smaller business right thats helpful thanks'],Jim Mitchell,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Can I just answer that real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put it in your comments, so everyone is going to put in extensive comments, kind of like you heard from Jeremy and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis I think is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.
I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish.
We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR, capital, etc., you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.
Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity, like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business.",['answer real quickly really know one-sided conversation generally say put comments everyone going put extensive comments kind like heard jeremy really know really know whats going inside fed many people get involved view become politicized process opposed technical analysis think required exactly right see think look markets alone huge think 60% increase capital look it product products worse others generally bad across products really important thing market making critical function look world large market makers could make markets governments hospitals cities schools states imf world bank blackrock blackstone various things buy sell clients size market makers different function hedge funds know real intent this another one think needs really thought trying accomplish market making quite safe never lost kind money people talk market making global market shock something like that thing market making agree could actually force people out force lower positions think little risky may also force consolidation clients since need much may consolidation unintended way market making obviously volatile markets constraints lcr slr capital etc constantly limitations do great opportunity european market makers mean great opportunity like repo fx swaps credit stuff 30% less capital big difference kind business'],Jamie Dimon,CEO & Co.
3Q23,"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years? Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher-than-expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there? Okay.

I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldnâ€™t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didnâ€™t balloon the costs when the revenue became as weâ€™ve argued unsustainably high. Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter â€“ so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.",['yeah mean wish sort answer fit better framework fundamental sense kind agree framework sense last couple years right world rates drop suddenly recover like quite dramatically credit becomes abnormally good rebounds seen significant fluctuations capital markets saw 2021 going 2022 revenue environment change lot short term reasons largely control course parts expense base short term directly sensitive revenue environment adjust naturally adjust forcefully function volumes things much structural goal make sure things sized appropriately believe sustainable cycle returns are always focused cost rest assured that discipline internally aggressive ever go budget cycle long-term plays really shouldnâ€™t expect us see trying generate cosmetically lower costs response lower revenue environment didnâ€™t balloon costs revenue became weâ€™ve argued unsustainably high yeah right contribution run-off loans notable first republic related net income printed quarter â€“ first thing say think first republic related net income number quarter sustainable indicator future run rate dynamics talked about particular over-earning deposits sort normal deposit margins also apply first republic franchise degree would expect normalize probably significantly things alluded to accelerated pull par commitments took fair value discount part acquisition thats short-term tailwind revenue come next quarters yeah terms going overall deepening relationships remains focus think happen continue integration continue stabilizing yeah think said press call things going well arguably little bit better sort modeled part acquisition happy see that'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss â€“ I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about? Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice? Okay. Great.

Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point. I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.",['yeah sure thanks jim so yeah talk drivers upward revision said higher rates coupled lower deposit reprice; hard untangle two drivers specifically think look consumer combination passage time positive feedback getting field cd offerings particular meant quite kind stable environment perspective similarly wholesale seeing slower internal migrations asked mix think obviously seeing cd mix increase would expect continue take place probably even past peak rate cycle next year continue capture money motion say important point fact that said earlier consider level nii generation sustainable talked previously sort medium-term run rate mid-70s first republic could argue maybe number little higher whatever is lot lower current number know thats going happen going predict exact moment; thats going function competitive dynamics marketplace want clear expect point necessarily assume evolution current run rate mid-70s number sensitive rate outlook particular put number there looked range different types rate environments reprice think would associated that really meant capture consider through-the-cycle sustainable number think particularly rate-dependent'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.
2Q23,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day 
 do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great. And so my follow-up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter? Thank you.",['hi good morning jeremy laughing said investor day nii rabbits pull hat guess do guess want ask broader question really here maybe jamie like get thoughts earned 23% rotce 138% cet1 hear loud clear normalized nii generation $87 billion said fully taking account potential haircut basel iii endgame possible natural rotce maybe 17% through-the-cycle rate rates zero first introduced rotce target different world rate scenario everybodys talking even fed cuts natural sort bottom fed funds going zero input would great follow-up question there maybe jeremy could remind us unemployment rate embedded acl ratio second quarter thank you'],Erika Najarian,"Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period. Yeah.

2Q23,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech.

Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?
Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?

Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barrâ€™s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.
It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.
Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.
It's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.
I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year.

Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month.

I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side. Yeah.

Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter. Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.",['yeah gerard would say honestly much changed actually pretty consistently concerned risk higher rates course always try position things produce reasonable outcomes across broad range scenarios margin biased towards higher rates may little less true levels before although lot consequence deposit convexity playing modeling case else equal think going continue focus making sure fine higher rate scenario staying balanced across range scenarios really lot change positioning thats obviously including fact took first republic which even net liabilities long structural interest rate position actually want get longer part deal result took actions ensure net-net still last quarter yeah would caution drawing broad conclusion this mean think talk office example portfolio know quite small exposure sort so-called urban dense office even smaller vast majority overall portfolio multi-family lending result like sample size observed valuations office properties quite small know like sort ahead cycle based everything saw quarter felt reasonable build little bit get felt like comfortable coverage ratio middle market segment saw downgrades excess upgrades see sort necessarily indicative anything terribly significant broader read-across'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

Poonawala,"Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization. Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right? He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners.

2Q23,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed? Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day â€“ gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not? Wait, wait. Just to be clear.

Mike, I mean... Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider. Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right? Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't. Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes â€“ that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot.

Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, weâ€™ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build â€“ I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion â€“ or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit. Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card income isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves. Why don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky.",['yeah good question steve let say couple things this obviously deposit numbers bounced around little bit function turmoil saw regional banks well obviously first republic transaction now look kind end-of-period deposits quarter project forward core view would expect sort modest downward trend re-assert higher starting point broadly function qt playing system noting hope offsets taking share give couple examples like consumer got branch expansion markets seasoning share opportunities there wholesale weâ€™ve obviously invested lot products services think compelling offerings helping us win mandates potentially share offsets there broadly core view remains modest deposit declines across franchise within that note thing noted got debt ceiling tga build come effect seen lot bill issuance big question market whether going come reserves come rrp far tga build â€“ guess targeting $600 billion $550 billion â€“ something almost done people feared come rrp say think thats relatively good sign highlights system works better got ample supply short-dated collateral front end yield curve whole rrp/tga bank reserve dynamic going continue significant good see rrp coming little bit yeah actually card income number steve little bit one-off thing reward liability adjustment quarter kind technical thing thats temporary headwind also sequential comparison also getting hurt small positive one-off item prior period obviously know guys looked it card income sort thing look much ourselves get mikael give you significant enough make sequential number look little bit wonky'],Jeremy Barnum,CFO & Co.

So, look, on pricing power, you're right â€“ it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product -specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases  are excessive and it puts pressure on retu rns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly sinc e we d on't actually have the proposal yet â€“ so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it? I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces b ad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending â€“ I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is a ctually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin -margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing p ower that we talked about a second ago.

2Q23,"Hi. Good morning.
I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.
So thenâ€¦
Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.
Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?
Got it.

Graseck,"Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Betsy.
Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about â€“ it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.
All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never â€“ the answer is going to always â€“ for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.
Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.
Yes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate Wholesale to Consumer.

Peabody,"Analyst, Portales Partners LLC","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity.

We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.

1Q23,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing â€“ do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks? No, fair â€“ all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment? Okay. Great.

1Q23,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.
In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June â€“ the results â€“ which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?
Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color â€“ I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it â€“ there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?
Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits?
Okay, very good.

1Q23,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply â€“ and that probably goes beyond office into apartments â€“ how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this â€“ the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying â€“ worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks. Got it. Very helpful.

1Q23,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.
All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM â€“ you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?
Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what?
All right.

1Q23,"Hi. Good morning.
I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII...
No, hear me? Hello?
Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about 
maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that 
that's the question.
Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?
Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for those?
Got it.
This is based on the current rule set.
I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.",['hi good morning want unpack question possibility higher longer rates impacts non-markets nii no hear me hello okay wanted unpack higher longer rate possibility impacts nii nii guide assuming forward curve understand correctly so event get higher longer much impact nii ex markets trying triangulate maybe lose deposits higher longer expect trajectory goes quarter opposed down thats question yeah got it okay thats super helpful understand think that follow-up buybacks take comments mean pause now thats case would driver restarting yeah give us sense basel iv endgame means rwas much baking those got it based current rule set like nii loans better gain sale prefer former latter thanks appreciate it'],Betsy L.

1Q23,"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is â€“ consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital â€“ and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments. Interesting. Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations. What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years? Yeah.

1Q23,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances.
