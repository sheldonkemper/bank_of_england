Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded 
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's 
website Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements Please stand by 
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum 
Mr Barnum, please go ahead 
 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase 
Thank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $481 on revenue of $437 
billion, with an ROTCE of 21% On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion 
or 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin 
compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in 
Card and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities 
losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $12 billion or 21% 
 
Expenses of $228 billion were down $17 billion or 7% year-on-year Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $12 
billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, 
reflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll 
remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of 
$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record 
number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and 
Securities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes 
 
On to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net 
income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share 
repurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which 
was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  
 
CCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue 
was down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues 
Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up 
14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In 
Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, 
revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong 
account acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new 
vehicle inventory 
 
Expenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit 
performance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card 
The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances 
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% 
year-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share 
growth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable 
market conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic 
about our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances 
and fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven 
by lower losses on hedges 
 
 
 
2
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as 
continued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased 
volatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher 
client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by 
higher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially 
Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, 
primarily offset by new originations 
 
In Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And 
Commercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% 
sequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of 
charge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & 
Wealth Management on page 7  
 
AWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by 
growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 
billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued 
growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive 
across all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset 
net inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued 
net inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to 
Corporate on page 8  
 
Corporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million 
year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a 
net loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter 
And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 
billion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  
 
We expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the 
forward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts 
in the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card 
loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to 
deposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's 
notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower 
rates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we 
illustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII 
increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR 
 
Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no 
longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be 
about $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very 
consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily 
driven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire 
bankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business 
driven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of 
spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we 
haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to 
help offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  
 
On credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was 
another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII 
normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the 
tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that 
context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  
 
 
3
 
Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence 
in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering 
support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief 
organizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts 
 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A 
 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase 
Good morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I 
just wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in 
Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then 
became co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of 
the great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone 
at the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made

Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's 
website Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  
 
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy 
Barnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 
billion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight 
year, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record 
quarterly revenues and record long -term flows  
 
Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets 
was up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and 
higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin 
compression  
 
NIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior yearâ€™s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset 
management and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  
 
Expenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and 
growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a 
net reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs 
were up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  
 
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and 
OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client 
activity and market moves on the trading side  
 
We had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa 
shares, as we have previously mentioned  
 
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was 
down 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and 
lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially 
We're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder 
of the year  
 
Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth 
management clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by 
lower servicing and production revenue  
 
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card 
outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 
billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly 
driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  
 
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 
million year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up 
31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the 
 
3
 
closing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market 
conditions  
 
In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and 
geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and 
higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  
 
Moving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & 
Emerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a 
supportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  
 
Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes 
Expenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation 
and growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  
 
Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client 
segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clientsâ€™ access to rec eptive capital 
markets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain 
muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  
 
Average client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and 
Securities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, 
partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  
 
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin 
of 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market 
levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by 
deposit margin compression  
 
Expenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation 
and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net 
inflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client 
assets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up 
2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  
 
Turning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was 
$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from 
prior quarters  
 
NIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment 
securities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  
 
To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be 
approximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on 
the page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets 
NII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  
 
So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect 
results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue 
delivering excellent returns through the cycle  
 
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A

2Q24,"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  
           
 
Operator : Good morning, ladies  and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being 
recorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on 
JPMorgan Chase's web site, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please standby  
 
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum Mr Barnum, pleas e go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $181 billion, EPS of $612 on rev enue of $51 
billion, with an ROTCE of 28% These results included the $ 79 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation 
contribution of the appreciated Visa stock Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate E xcluding these 
items, the Firm had net income of $131 bi llion, EPS of $440, and an ROTCE of 20%  
 
Touching on a couple of highlights In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year -on-year and 17% quarter -on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up 
10% year -on-year In CCB, we had a record number of first -time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and 
Card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM  
 
Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling o ut the First 
Republic contribution in the presentation Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in  the year -on-year 
comparison As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior -year quarter  only has two months of First Republic 
results compared to the full three months this quarter Also, in the prior -year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now 
they are primarily in the relevant line of business  
 
Now, turning to page 2  for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $86 billion or 20% year -on-year Excluding both 
the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $27 billion, revenue of $431 b illion was 
up $34 billion or 9% NII ex Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates,  higher revolving 
balances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic -related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit 
balances  
 
NIR ex Markets was up $73 billion or 56% Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $21 billion or 21%, largely driv en by higher 
Investment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees Both periods inc luded net investment securities losses And Markets revenue was 
up $731 million or 10% year -on-year Expenses of $237 billion were up $29 billion or 14% year -on-year Excluding the Foundation 
contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, prim arily driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and 
growth in employees And credit costs were $31 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $22 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million Net 
charge -offs were up $820 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and 
$189 million in Wholesale  
 
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, up 30 basis points versus the pri or quarter, 
primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA As you know, we completed CCAR a coup le of weeks 
ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points Let me summarize them again here Our preliminary SC B is 33%, although the 
final SCB could be higher The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 29%, results in a 123% standard ized CET1 ratio 
requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 And finally, the Firm an nounced that the board intends to increase the 
quarterly common stock dividend from $115 to $125 per share in the third quarter of 2024  
 
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $42 billion on revenue of $177 billion, which was 
up 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year -on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin 
compression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter -on-
quarter Client investment assets were up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by market performance In Home Lending, revenue of $13 
billion was up 31% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one addit ional month of the First Republic portfolio  
 
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances 
Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the co ntinued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were 
$108 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins Expense s of $94 billion 
were up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven b y First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as 
well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing  
 
3
 
 
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecti ng net charge -offs of $21 billion, up $813 million year -on-year, 
predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues The net reserve build was $579 mil lion, also 
driven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certa in macroeconomic variables  
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $59 billion on  revenue 
of $179 billion You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client 
coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise This  quarter, IB fees 
were up 50% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 95% In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven 
by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior -year quarter Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up 
51%, benefiting from favorable market conditio ns 
 
In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year -on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter We remain cautiously optimistic 
about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect It's also worth noting that pull -forward refinancing activity was a 
meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year  
 
Payments revenue was $45 billion, down 4% year -on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit -related client credits were 
largel y offset by fee growth Moving to Markets, total revenue was $78 billion, up 10% year -on-year Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued 
strength in Securitized Products And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record 
revenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels Security Services revenue of $13 billio n was up 3% 
year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compressio n Expenses of $92 billion were up 
12% year -on-year, largely driven by higher revenue -related compensation, legal expense, and volume -related non -compensation expense  
 
In Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year -on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially 
Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic 
environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre -pandemic levels Also, capital markets are open and are providing an 
alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination an d pay -off activity 
Average client deposits were up 2% year -on-year and relativ ely flat sequentially Finally, credit costs were $384 million The net reserve build 
of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach Net charge -offs were $164 
million, of which about half was in Office  
 
Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $13 billion, with p re-tax 
margin of 32% Revenue of $53 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and 
strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression Expenses of $35 bill ion were up 12% 
year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue -related compensation and continue d growth in our private banking 
advisor teams For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 
$16 billion AUM of $37 trillion was up 15% year -on-year, and client assets o f $54 trillion were up 18% year -on-year, driven by higher market 
levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter -on-quarter  
 
Turning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $68 billion on revenue  of $101 billion Excluding this quarter's Visa -related 
gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year -on-year NII was up $626 
million year -on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mi x and higher rates Expenses of $16 billion were up $427 million year -on-year 
Excluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year -on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic -related 
expense out of Corporate into the relevant  segments  
 
To finish up, we have the outlook on page 8 Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at In vestor Day 
We continue to expect NII and NII ex Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net 
charge -off rate of approximately 34%  
 
So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net incom e, or more 
importantly, after excluding the significant it ems, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong And, as always, we remain focused 
on continuing to execute with discipline  
 
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A

Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being 
recorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presen tation Please standby  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Offic er, Jeremy 
Barnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone The presentation is available on our website  and please refer to the disclaimer in the 
back  
 
Starting  on page 1  â€“ the firm reported net income of $134 billion, EPS of $444 on revenue of $4 25 billion  and delivered an ROTCE of 21% 
These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from 
the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Touching on a co uple of highlights Firm wide IB fees were up 18% year -on-year, 
reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealt h Management 
business  
 
On page 2, we have some more detail This i s the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First 
Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year -on-year results comparable For this quarter, First Republic 
contributed $17 bi llion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income  
 
Now, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic  â€“ revenue of $409 billion was up $15 billion or 4% year -on-year NII ex  
Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving bal ances in Card, 
largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB NIR ex  Markets was up $12 billion  or 12%, driven by higher 
Firmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses And Markets revenue was down 
$400 million or 5% year -on-year  
 
Expenses of $22 billion were up $18 billion or 9% year -on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the 
increase to the FDIC's special assessment And credit costs were $19 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release 
of $38 million Net charge -offs were up $ 816 (sic)  million, predominately driven by Card  
 
On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting 
net income which was predominantly o ffset by higher RWA and capital distribution This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal 
effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower  Card loans  
 
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 Consumers remain  financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market 
While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre -pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation W hen 
looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year  
 
Turning now to the financial results , excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $44 billion on revenue of $166 billion, which was 
up 1% year -on-year I n Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year -on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with 
average balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased Client investment assets were up 25% year -on-year, driven by market p erformance 
and strong net inflows In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue 
Originations, while still modest, were up 10%  
 
Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially 
offset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 13% du e to strong 
account acquisition and the continued normal ization of revolve And in Auto, originations were $89 billion, down 3%, while we maintained 
healthy margins and market share  
 
Expenses of $88 billion were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and m arketing In 
terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $19 billion, driven by net charge -offs which were up $825 million year -on-year, 
predominately due to continued normalization in Card The net reserve build was $45 million, reflectin g the build in Card, largely offset by a 
release in Home Lending

Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5 Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the la st quarter we will 
report earnings for the CIB and CB as standal one segments Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8 K with historical results 
including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line 
with the re -organization that was announced in January  
 
Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $48 billion on revenue of $136 billion Investment Banking revenue  of $2 billion was 
up 27% year -on-year IB fees were up 21% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees 
were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved marke t conditions , 
with debt up 58% and equity up 51 % 
 
In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be m indful that some 
meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year Similarly, while it was encouragi ng to see some positive momentum in 
announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from 
the regulatory environment Payments revenue was $24 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit -related 
client credits were largely offset by higher fee -based revenue and deposit balances  
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year -on-year Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and 
Commodities compared to a strong prior -year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products Equity Markets was flat 
Securities Services revenue of $12 billion was up 3% year -on-year Expenses of $72 bi llion were down 4% year -on-year, predominantly 
driven by lower legal expense  
 
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6 Commercial Banking reported net income of $16 billion Revenue of $36 billion was up 3% year -
on-year, drive n by higher non -interest revenue Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year -on-year, with 
increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior  year quarter  
 
Payments revenue of $19 billio n was down 2% year -on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net 
of higher deposit -related client credits Expenses of $15 billion were up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, 
reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense  
 
Average deposits were down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits and down 1% quarter -on-quarter, reflecting 
seasonally lower balances Loans were flat quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were down 1 %, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients 
remain cautious And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payof f activity  
 
Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge -offs of $66 million  
 
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre -tax margin 
of 28% Revenue of $47 billion was down 1% year -on-year Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, 
driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin 
compression  
 
Expenses of $34 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation, 
continued growth in our private banking adv isor teams and the impact of the J P Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as 
higher distribution  fees  
 
For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income AUM of $36 trillion was up 19% year -on-year and 
client assets of $52 trillion were up 20% year -on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were down 
1% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were flat  
 
Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million Revenue was $23 billion, up $13 billion year -on-year NII 
was $25 billion, up $737 million year -on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates NIR was a net loss of $188 million 
The current  quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior 
year quarter Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year -on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment  
 
To finish up, we have the outlook on page 9 We now expect NII ex  Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that 
contained three rate cuts at quarter  end Our total NII guidance remains approximately $ 90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Market s NII 
guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix sh ift in the Markets 
business, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII a re generally revenue neutral  
 
Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned  upfront And on 
credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 35%  
 
 
4
 
Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete 
items, which can vary quite a bit The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amort ization method for certain tax equity 
investments Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 35% above the effective tax rate This is a smaller g ap than we 
previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going f orward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it 
has in the past  
 
For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income ; we're just mentioning this to help with 
your models  
 
So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins While we  
remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolit ical and 
regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate 
those challenges as well as any others that may come our way  
 
And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A

4Q23,"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  
           
 
Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being 
recorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go to the live presentation Please stand by  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Offic er, Jeremy 
Barnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thank you and good morning everyone The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the b ack Starting 
on page 1, the firm reported net income of $93 billion, EPS of $304 on revenue of $399 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15% These 
results included the $29 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate  
 
On page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results Simi lar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where 
relevant You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate line s of business For 
the quarter, First Republic contrib uted $19 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income  
 
Now focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $381 billion was up $25 billion or  7% year -on-year 
NII ex Markets was up $2 2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates NIR ex Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets 
revenue was up $141 million or 2% Expenses of $236 billion were up $46 billion or 24% year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC 
special a ssessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology  
 
And credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $22 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million Net charge -offs were up $13 
billion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved The net re serve build 
was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuat ions in the Commercial 
Bank  
 
Looking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $1623 and revenue of $162 bi llion And we 
delivered an ROTCE of 21% On to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quar ter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points 
versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pac e of capital 
distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endga me requirements  
 
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5 Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year -on-year, driven by strong 
account growth, and consumer spend remained stable Turning now to the financial results excluding Fir st Republic, CCB reported net income 
of $44 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year -on-year  
 
In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year -on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with 
average balances down 8% year -on-year Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows â€“ in 
fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by  the absence of 
an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII  
 
Moving to Card Services & Auto â€“ revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially 
offset by lower Auto lease income C ard outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve 
And in Auto, originations were $99 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins  
 
Expenses of $87 billion were up 10% yea r-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, 
advisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology In terms of credit  performance 
this quarter, cre dit costs were $22 billion, largely driven by net charge -offs, which were up $791 million year -on-year, predominantly due to 
continued normalization in Card The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card  
 
Next, the CIB on page 6 Th e CIB reported net income of $25 billion on revenue of $11 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was 
up 13% year -on-year IB fees were also up 13% year -on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 88% In 
Advisory,  fees were up 2% Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior -year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up 
30%

We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but anno unced M&A remains a 
headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain Payments revenue was $23 billion, up 10% 
year-on-year Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit -related client credits  
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $58 billion, up 2% year -on-year Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8% It was another 
strong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lo wer revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year 
Equity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash Securities Services revenue of $12 billion was up 3% year -
on-year Expenses of $68 billion were up 4% year -on-year, p redominantly driven by the timing of revenue -related compensation Credit costs 
were $210 million, reflecting net charge -offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million  
 
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7 Commercial Banking reported net income of $15 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 7% year -
on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances Payments revenu e of $2 billion, 
was up 2% year -on-year, driven by fee growth, la rgely offset by deposit -related client credits Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue 
of $924 million, was up 32% year -on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity  
 
Expenses of $14 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as 
well as higher volume -related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 6% year -on-year, primarily 
driven by l ower non -operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter -on-quarter as client balances 
are seasonally higher at year -end 
 
Loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revo lver utilization and muted demand for new loans as 
clients remain cautious And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff acti vity Finally, 
credit costs were $269 million, including net charge -offs of $127  million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our 
commercial real estate valuation outlook  
 
And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million â€“ with p re-tax 
margin of 28% Revenue of $47 billion was up 2% year -on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average 
market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balance s, partially offset by wider 
spreads on loans  
 
Expenses of $34 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance -based incentives; 
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J P Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the 
continued investment in Global Shares  
 
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $12 billion â€“ positive across Equities and Fixed Income â€“ and $140 billion for the full year In 
liquidity, we saw net  inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year And we had record client asset net 
inflows $489 billion for the year AUM of $34 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year -on-year, driven by continued net 
inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter -on-quarter  
 
Turning to Corporate on page 9 Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million Revenue of $18 billion was up $597  million year -on-year NII of 
$25 billion, was up $12 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix NIR was a net loss of $687 million, 
compared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities lo sses I mentioned upfront And expenses of $34 billion 
were up $3 billion year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment  
 
With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10 We expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be  approximately $88 billion 
Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this ye ar On deposits, we 
expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels While lower rates sho uld decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset 
sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins We expect strong loan grow th in Card to 
continue, but not at the same pace as 2023 Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates Outside of Card, loan growth will 
likely remain muted  
 
It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex Markets run rate of $94 billion Combining that with the ful l year guidance of 
approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for 
some time And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII out look r emain 
And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which , as always, you 
should think of as largely offset in NIR  
 
Now, let's turn to expenses on page 11 We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion You'll see on the slide, we provided detail 
by line of business Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the 
greatest opportunities are, both in terms  of share and available returns And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and 
then  
 
4
 
 
On the right -hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call busines s 
growth wr it large Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue -related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the 
company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023 But in addition, the ongoing growth of  the company, 
which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categ ories  
 
The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, 
technology, as well as marketing Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lo wer 2024 exit run 
rate as the result of business integration efforts Finally, despite significantly l ower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see 
some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories  
 
It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have be en executed both in response to 
market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company We've included the fourth qu arter 2023 exit 
rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year -on-year incre ase in expense is already in the run rate  
 
Now, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 35%, 
consistent with Investor Day guidance So, in closing, we shouldn't le ave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing 
record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank 
everyone who made it possible At the same time, w e emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over -earning, as indicated by 
an ROTCE that is 4% above our through -the-cycle target  
 
As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns 
But, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncerta inties, we remain 
optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a bro ad range of environments, and this management team 
remains laser -focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities

3Q23,"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  
           
 
Operator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being 
recorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  
 
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, 
Jamie Dimon Mr Dimon, please go ahead  
           
Jamie  Dimon  
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Good morning, everybody Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the 
discussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the 
resulting bloodshed and more Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all 
who are suffering  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thanks, Jamie And of course, I very much echo the sentiment Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results The prese ntation is 
available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back  
 
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $132 billion, EPS of $433 on revenue of $407 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22% 
These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense On page 2, 
we have some more detail  
 
Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $22 billion of 
revenue, $858 million of expense and $11 bi llion of net income Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of 
$385 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year  
 
NII ex Markets was up $48 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances NIR ex Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar And Markets 
revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year  
 
Expenses of $209 billion were up $17 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing 
as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense And credit costs were $14 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d 
included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth  
 
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 143%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior 
quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this 
quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will 
continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge  
 
And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4 Given 
the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important 
to spend time discussing it And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular 
detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that 
banks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress  
 
Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does 
not make sense to us Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which 
results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion  
 
One immediate thing to point out is that at 45% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $225 billion of additional ca pital with no 
change in our  systemic risk footprint We've been on the record for a long time The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated 
originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset 
has made matters worse And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA  
 
3
 
Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer 
constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges Another lense on the proposed increases is the 
introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer Although 
there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in 
the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by 
around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio  
 
Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years Zooming ou t from the details 
of this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017 Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have 
been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 45% So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their 
current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point This illustrates again how over 
calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the 
SCB And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e And aside from 
those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework  
 
We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here While it may technically be true  that the proposal is 
Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements Implementing the Basel III Endgame 
consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, 
would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements  
 
As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical 
detail For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the 
flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time Th e current proposal 
exacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant 
impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers  
 
In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic 
changes of the current operation of the US capital markets We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying 
capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, 
which is vital to the US economy So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude  
 
With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with 
nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower 
income groups normalizing faster  
 
Turnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up 
19% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates  End -of-period 
deposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our 
leadership position in key markets Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows 
as we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers  
 
In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market Originations of $103 billion were up slightly quarter -on-
quarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year  
 
Moving to Card Services & Auto â€“ revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially 
offset by lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued 
normalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were up $102 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained 
market share  
 
Expenses of $85 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology 
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $14 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, 
predomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, 
primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending  
 
Next, the CIB on page 7 CIB reported net income of $31 billion , on revenue of $117 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was 
down 6% year -on-year IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 86% In Advisory, 
fees were down 10% Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity  
 
In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the 
fourth quarter Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  
 
4
 
continue to be a headwind Payments revenue was $21 billion, up 3% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by 
higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances  
 
Moving to Markets â€“ total revenue was $66 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year Fixed Income was up 
1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit This was 
predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year Equity Markets was down 1 0%, 
reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility Securities 
Services revenue of $12 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances Expenses of $74 
billion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation  
 
Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net 
charge -offs of $45 million  
 
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8 Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $17 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 20% 
year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates And Gross Investment Banking and Markets 
revenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume  
 
Expenses of $14 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology 
investments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 7% year -
on-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives  
 
Loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization And 
CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity  
 
Finally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million  
 
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $11 billion, with pr e-tax margin 
of 31% Revenue of $46 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market 
levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits Expenses of $31 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by 
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JP Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares 
acquisitions  
 
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of 
$40 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $46 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net 
inflows of higher market levels Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, 
partially offset by client inflows  
 
Turning to Corporate on page 10 Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $15 billion, up $18 billion com pared to last 
year NII was $2 billio n, up $12 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the 
net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year  
 
To finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $885 billion and $89 billion, 
respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, 
while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable  
 
Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal 
expense  Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment  
 
And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 25%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent 
balance growth  
 
So to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various 
sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd 
the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past But as always, we con tinue to 
prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most  
 
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A

Operator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being 
recorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go to the live presentation Please stand by  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Office r, Jeremy 
Barnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thanks, operator Good morning, everyone The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back 
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $145 billion, EPS of $475 on revenue of $424 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25% 
These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $27 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republi c lending portfolio of 
$12 billion as well as $900 millio n of net investment securities losses in Corporate Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment 
assets were up 18% year -on-year, we had record long -term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share  
 
Before giving you more detail  on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2 The 
settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed Systems integration  is also 
proceedi ng apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid -2024 First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 
2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers And although it's still early days, as we get th e sales force back in 
the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisi tion 
 
Now turning back to this quarter's results on page 3 You'll see that in various parts of the presenta tion, we have specifically called out the 
impact of First Republic where relevant To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this 
quarter's results at the Firmwide level Then, for the rest of the prese ntation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to 
improve comparability with prior periods With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue , $599 million of 
expense, and $24 billion of net incom e As noted on the first page, this includes $27 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR 
in the Corporate segment, as well as $12 billion of allowance build And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic 
numbers  only represent two months of results  
 
You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM And f or the 
purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially  all of the expenses are in Corporate As the integration 
continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic 
Revenue of $384 billion was up $67 billion or 21% year -on-year NII ex Markets was up $78 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates NIR ex 
Markets was down $293 million , largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less 
notable items primarily in the pr ior year And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year -on-year Expenses of $202 billion were up 
$15 billion or 8% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense And 
credit costs  of $17 billion included net charge -offs of $14 billion , predominantly in Card  
 
The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in 
Corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later On to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 
138%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republ ic And as you can 
see i n the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio  And as 
you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago Our new indicative SCB is 29% versus our current requirement of 4% and  it goes into 
effect in 4Q23 The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $105 per share in the third quar ter 
 
On liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor D ay About half of the reduction 
is associated with the First Republic transaction And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10 -K, we will be updating our 
Earnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags So whe n we release this quarter's 10 -Q, you will see the up 100 -
basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $25 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have be en about negative 
$15 billion Now let's go to our businesses starting w ith CCB on page 5 Both US consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we 
haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day Turning now to the financial results which I 
will speak to excluding the imp act of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $164 billion, 
which was up 31% year -on-year  
 
In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates End -of-period deposits were down 
4% quarter -on-quarter , as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher -yielding 
 
3
 
products Client investment assets were up 18% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and 
digital channels In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year -on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing 
and production revenue Ori ginations were up quarter -on-quarter , driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year -on-year Moving to Card 
Services & Auto, revenue was up 5% , largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto 
lease income  
 
Card outstandings were up 18% year -on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth And in Auto, 
originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year -on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to sl owly recover Expenses of $83 
billion were up 8% year -on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest 
in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing In terms of credit p erformance this quarter, our credit costs were $15 billion, 
reflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services Net charge -offs were $13 billion, up $640 million year -on-
year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day -plus del inquencies have returned to pre -pandemic levels, in line with our expectations  
 
Next, the CIB on page 6 CIB reported net income of $41 billion on revenue of $125 billion Investment Banking revenue of $ 15 billion was 
up 11% year -on-year or down 7% exc luding bridge book markdowns in the prior year IB fees were down 6% year -on-year and we ranked 
number one with year -to-date wallet share of 84% In Advisory, fees were down 19% Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% 
for equity with more posi tive momentum in the last month of the quarter In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs 
of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year However, year -to-date announced M&A is 
down significantly, which will be a headwind  
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year -on-year Fixed Income was down 3% As expected, the macro franchise 
substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and clien t flows This was largely offset by improved performance in the 
Securitized Products Group and Credit Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior -year quarter, particularly in derivatives 
Payments revenue was $25 billion, up 61% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, 
partially offset by lower deposit balances Securities Services revenue of $12 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially 
offset by lower fees Exp enses of $69 billion were up 1% year -on-year, driven by higher non -compensation expense as well as wage inflation 
and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation  
 
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7 Commercial Banking repo rted net income of $15 billion Revenue of $38 billion was up 42% 
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins Payments revenue of $22 billion was up 79% year -on-year, driven by higher rates Gross 
Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 milli on was down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals Expenses of 
$13 billion were up 12% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology 
investments, as well as higher volu me-related expense Average deposits were up 3% quarter -on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new 
client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non -operating deposits Loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were up 
2%, reflectin g stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth  in 
areas where we are investing  
 
CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior -year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased 
affordable housing activity Finally, credit costs were $489 million Net charge -offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real 
estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was dri ven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market 
as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8 Asset & W ealth 
Management reported net income of $11 billion  with pre -tax margin of 32% Revenue of $46 billion was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher 
deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows Expenses of $32 billion were up 8% year -on-year, 
driven by higher compensatio n, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation, and the impact 
of Global Shares and JP Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year  
 
For the quarter, record net long -term infl ows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income 
and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 16% year -on-year and overall client assets of $46 
trillion w ere up 20% year -on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares 
And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower securities -based lending and deposits were down 6% Turn ing to 
Corporate on page 9 As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of t he expenses in 
Corporate Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million Revenue was $985 million, up  $905 million compared to last 
year  
 
NII was $18 billion, up $14 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net 
investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year -on-year, largely driven by higher legal 
expense And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First R epublic in the first 
quarter was eliminated as part of th e transaction Next, the outlook on page 10 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be 
approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assum ed across both 
Consumer and Wholesale  And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we 
do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for d eposits plays ou t 
 
4
 
 
Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $845 billion And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net char ge-off rate to 
be approximately 26% So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter A s we look forward, we remain 
focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capita l from the pending 
finalization of the Basel III rules Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahea d, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to 
continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios

1Q23,"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  
           
 
Operator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie D imon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy 
Barnum  
 
Mr Barnum, please go ahead  
           
Jeremy Barnum  
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  
Thanks, and good morning, everyone The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the b ack 
 
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $126 billion, EPS o f $410 on revenue of $393 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23% 
These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate  
 
Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures Jamie has add ressed a number of the important themes in 
his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm  
 
As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and m oney market fund inflows, most 
significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average  deposits 
were down 3% quarter -on-quarter while end -of-period deposits were up 2% quarter -on-quarter  â€“ implying an intra -quarter reversal of the 
recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of the se deposit 
inflows at quarter -end 
 
It's important to note that while the sequential p eriod -end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full 
year NII outlook â€“ which I will address at the end â€“ still assumes modest deposit outflows from here We expect these outflows to be driven by 
the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows  
 
Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit 
and credit card spe nd up 10% year -on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company  
 
On page 2, we have some more detail Revenue of $393 billion was up $77 billion or 25% year -on-year NII ex Markets was up $92 billion  
or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances NIR ex Markets was down $11 billion or 10%, dri ven by the 
securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Market s revenue was 
down $371 million or 4% year -on-year   
 
Expenses of $201 billion were up $916 million or 5% year -on-year, driven by compensation -related costs reflecting the annualization of last 
year's headcount growth and wage inflation These results inc lude the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, 
of course, is unrelated to recent events And credit costs of $23 billion included net charge -offs of $11 billion, predominantly in Card The net 
reserve build of $11 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted -average economic outlook  
 
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 138%, up about 60 basis points, which w as primarily 
driven by the benefit of net income les s distributions and AOCI gains And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks 
this quarter and distributed a total of $19 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders  
 
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4 Touching quickly on the health of US consumers and small businesses based 
on our data Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monito r their activity 
closely Spend remains solid and we ha ve not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter  
 
Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $52 billion, on revenue of $165 billion, which was up 35% year -on-year In Banking 
and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates Average deposits were down 2% quarter -
on-quarter, in line with recent trends Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products a s you would 
expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings Client investment assets were down 
1% year -on-year, but up 7% quarter -on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows In Home Lending, revenue was 
down 38% year -on-year, l argely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue  
 
3
 
Moving to Card Services and Auto â€“ revenue was up 14% year -on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving 
balances, partially offset  by lower Auto lease income Credit card spend was up 13% year -on-year Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by 
strong new account growth and revolve normalization And in Auto, originations were $92 billion, up 10% year -on-year Expenses of $81 
billion  were up 5% year -on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit 
costs were $14 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending Net charg e-offs were $11 billion, up 
about $500 million year -on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios  
 
Next, the CIB on page 5 CIB reported net income of $44 billion on revenue of $136 billion Investment  Banking revenue of $16 billion was 
down 24% year -on-year IB fees were down 19% We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 87% In advisory, fees were down 
6% compared to a strong first quarter last year Our underwriting businesses contin ued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 
34% for debt and 6% for equity  
 
In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to mark et conditions and 
the economic outlook We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging  
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $84 billion, down 4% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat Rates was strong during the rally early in the 
quarter, as well as throug h the elevated volatility in March Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging 
Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in  the prior year Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in 
derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash  
 
Payments revenue was $24 billion, up 26% year -on-year Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it 
was up 55%, with the gro wth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances Securities Services revenue of $11 billion was 
up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels Expenses of $75 billion were up 2% 
year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation  
 
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6 Commercial Banking reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $35 billion was up 46% 
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year -on-year driven by higher rates, and gross 
Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year -on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal act ivity 
 
Expenses of $13 billion were up 16% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and 
technology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense Average deposits were down 16% year -on-year and 5%  quarter -on-
quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non -operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances  
 
Loans were up 13% year -on-year and 1% sequentially C&I loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on 
client size In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, wh ich is also 
leading to weakness in capex spending  
 
In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quar ter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for 
bank debt CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayment s And given 
the recent focus on commercial real estate, le t me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused 
in urban dense markets; and nearly two -thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets Finally, credit costs of 
$417 million incl uded a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront  
 
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin 
of 35% Revenue of $48 bil lion was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our 
initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the  impact of lower 
avera ge market levels on management fees and lower performance fees Expenses of $31 billion were up 8% year -on-year, predominantly 
driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation and the run -rate impact 
of acquisitions  
 
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, 
inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year -on-year and overall client assets of $43 trillion were up 6% 
driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long -term products And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower 
securities -based lending, while average deposits were down 5% 
 
Turning to Corporate on page 8 Corporate reported net income of $244 million Revenue was $985 million compared to a net los s of $881 
million last year NII was $17 billion, up $23 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates NIR was a loss of $755 million compared 
with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and  included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier Expenses of $160 million 
were down $24 million year -on-year And credit costs of $370 million were driven by  reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures  
 
 
4
 
Next, the Outlook on page 9 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $81 billion This increase in gui dance is 
primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consume r and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as 
well as slightly higher card revolving balances Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance inc reases are not a 
meaningful contributor to the upward  revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later 
in the year  
 
I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex Markets run -rate in t he medium -term 
is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our fu ll year guidance; and 
while we don't know exactly when this lower run -rate will be reached, when it happens, we beli eve it will be around the mid -70s 
 
And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with th e timing and the 
extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader 
macroeconomic environment â€“ including its impact on loan growth Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly 
positive towards the end of the year as a function of m ix and rate effects  
 
Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the 
pending FDIC special assessment And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 26%  
 
So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise We have  benefited from our 
fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment
