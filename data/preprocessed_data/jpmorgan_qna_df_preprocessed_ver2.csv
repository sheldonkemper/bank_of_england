"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open. 8","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf,4Q24,2025-01-15,"['okay', 'great', 'thanks', 'operator', 'thank', 'you', 'next', 'line', 'erika', 'najarian', 'ubs', 'line', 'open']",['okay great thanks operator: thank you next go line erika najarian ubs line open 8'],"['right', 'erika', 'okay', 'tempting', 'many', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'deep', 'let', 'try', 'address', 'much', 'great', 'length', 'first', 'all', 'gsib', 'yes', 'high', 'print', 'third', 'quarter', 'normal', 'seasonality', 'third', 'quarter', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'current', 'view', 'gsib', 'number', 'estimate', 're', 'quite', 'confident', 'wound', 'comfortably', 'bucket', 'result', 'normal', 'seasonality', 'actually', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'december', 'term', 'type', 'yearend', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'create', 'pressure', 'various', 'type', 'less', 'might', 'otherwise', 'expected', 'term', 'typical', 'seasonal', 'pattern', 'much', 'see', 'there', 'obvious', 'point', 'also', 'even', 'existing', 'proposed', 'gsib', 'rule', 'obviously', 'little', 'bit', 'hung', 'smaller', 'bucket', 'recalibration', 'even', 'sort', 'obvious', 'would', 'mattered', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'but', 'anyway', 'now', 're', 'managing', 'current', 'rule', 'normal', 'seasonality', 'took', 'back', 'okay', 'mentioned', 'lawsuit', 'think', 'thing', 'say', 'happy', 'see', 'clear', 'recognition', 'part', 'fed', 'many', 'thing', 've', 'talking', 'long', 'time', 'term', 'transparency', 'volatility', 'nonsubstantive', 'bureaucratic', 'burden', 'associated', 'ccar', 'process', 'need', 'improvement', 'that', 'great', 'think', 'speak', 'industry', 'body', 'actual', 'litigant', 'seems', 'read', 'said', 'publicly', 'press', 'release', 'much', 'anything', 'preserving', 'right', 'light', 'statute', 'limitation', 'deadline', 'coming', 'let', 'hope', 'see', 'significant', 'progress', 'front', 'then', 'taking', 'step', 'back', 'high', 'level', 'really', 'asking', 'core', 'view', 'about', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'think', 'lens', 'numerator', 'actually', 'core', 'view', 'just', 'sake', 'argument', 'assume', 'modest', 'growth', 'normalized', 'amount', 'economic', 'denominator', 'like', 'actual', 'need', 'capital', 'organically', 'likely', 'additional', 'numerator', 'needed', 'function', 'environment', 'way', 're', 'increasingly', 'thinking', 'different', 'scenario', 'analysis', 'like', 'flat', 'numerator', 'numerator', 'numerator', 'numerator', 'guess', 'could', 'version', 'world', 'numerator', 'little', 'less', 'guessing', 'central', 'case', 'comparing', 'projected', 'capital', 'amount', 'number', 'determine', 'excess', 'point', 'out', '', 'think', 'actual', 'quantum', 'numerator', 'something', 'like', 'billion', 'pretty', 'much', 'reasonable', 'lens', 'ton', 'excess', 've', 'concluded', 'need', 'grow', 'anymore']",['right erika okay tempting many rabbit holes deep lets try address much great length first all g-sib so yes high print third quarter normal seasonality third quarter fourth quarter so current view g-sib number estimate were quite confident wound comfortably 5% bucket result normal seasonality actually relatively quiet december terms types year-end things sometimes create pressures various types less might otherwise expected terms typical seasonal patterns so much see there obvious point also even existing proposed g-sib rule obviously little bit hung up smaller buckets recalibration on even sort obvious would mattered one way other but anyway now were managing current rules normal seasonality took us back 5% okay mentioned lawsuit think thing say happy see clear recognition part fed many things weve talking long time terms transparency volatility non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated ccar process needs improvement so thats great think speak industry bodies actual litigants seems me read said publicly press releases much anything preserving rights light statute limitations deadlines coming up so lets hope see significant progress front then taking step back high level really asking is core view about think probably best way think lens numerator actually core view just sake argument assume modest growth normalized amount economic denominator like actual need capital organically likely additional numerator needed function environment way were increasingly thinking different scenario analysis like flat numerator 5% numerator 10% numerator 20% numerator guess could versions world numerators little less guessing central case comparing projected capital amount number determine excess point out 157% think actual quantum numerator something like $275 billion pretty much reasonable lens ton excess weve concluded need grow anymore']

All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on.

"John McDonald, Analyst, Autonomous Research","Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc","Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency. 5",4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf,4Q24,2025-01-15,"['okay', 'thanks', 'jeremy', 'followup', 'think', 'investment', 'spend', 'agenda', 'year', 'differ', 'from', 'say', 'last', 'year', 'last', 'couple', 'year', 'across', 'line', 'business', 'kind', 'certainty', 'return', 'spectrum', 'talked', 'about', 'kind', 'efficiency', 'baked', 'outlook', 'well', 'thanks']",['okay thanks jeremy follow-up think investment spend agenda year differ from say last year last couple years across lines business kind certainty return spectrum talked about kind efficiencies baked outlook well thanks'],"['sure', 'truth', 'guess', 'good', 'thing', 'theme', 'remarkably', 'consistent', 'seeing', 'result', 'kind', 'high', 'certainty', 'investment', 'choice', 'across', 'category', 'know', 'well', 'highlighted', 'outlook', 'page', 'expense', 'continue', 'main', 'area', 'focus', 'execution', 'get', 'tweaked', 'margin', 'pursue', 'different', 'opportunity', 'commercial', 'investment', 'bank', 'continue', 'drilling', 'analyzing', 'relative', 'pocket', 'weakness', 'might', 'see', 'level', 'two', 'significantly', 'strong', 'share', 'position', 'see', 'aggregate', 'level', 'daniel', 'always', 'talked', 'red', 'amber', 'behind', 'green', 'that', 'embedded', 'culture', 'company', 'everywhere', 'continue', 'analyzing', 'iterating', 'throw', 'resource', 'stuff', 'that', 'but', 'broadly', 'theme', 'consistent', 'think', 'term', 'efficiency', 'couple', 'thing', 'say', 'know', 'well', 'one', 'think', 'efficiency', 'generate', 'company', 'organic', 'bau', 'evergreen', 'happens', 'every', 'day', 'team', 'everywhere', 'sort', 'part', 'bottom', 'culture', 'remains', 'case', 'topdown', 'area', 'focus', 'think', 'example', 'technology', 'starter', 're', 'putting', 'lot', 'effort', 'improving', 'sort', 'ability', 'software', 'engineer', 'productive', 'development', 'there', 'lot', 'focus', 'development', 'environment', 'them', 'order', 'enable', 'productive', 'else', 'equal', 'generates', 'little', 'bit', 'efficiency', 'also', 'lot', 'focus', 'efficiency', 'hardware', 'utilization', 'that', 'embedded', 'well', 'another', 'thing', 'that', 'worth', 'noting', 'recall', 'that', 'investor', 'day', 'talked', 'probably', 'reached', 'peak', 'modernization', 'spend', 'jamie', 'always', 'say', 're', 'always', 'modernizing', 'fact', 've', 'gotten', 'peak', 'might', 'come', 'little', 'bit', 'still', 'mean', 're', 'going', 'constantly', 'modernizing', 'but', 'margin', 'mean', 'inside', 'tech', 'team', 'there', 'little', 'bit', 'capacity', 'get', 'freed', 'focus', 'feature', 'new', 'product', 'development', 'also', 'sense', 'form', 'efficiency']",['sure truth – guess good thing themes remarkably consistent so seeing results kind high certainty investment choices across categories know well highlighted outlook page expenses continue main areas focus execution gets tweaked margin pursue different opportunities commercial & investment bank continue drilling analyzing relative pockets weakness might see go level two significantly strong share positions see aggregate level daniel always talked reds ambers behind greens thats embedded culture company everywhere continue analyzing iterating throw resources stuff that but broadly themes consistent think terms efficiency couple things say know well one is think efficiency generate company organic bau evergreen; happens every day teams everywhere sort part bottoms- culture remains case top-down areas focus think go example technology starters were putting lot effort improving sort ability software engineers productive development theres lot focus – development environment them order enable productive else equal generates little bit efficiency also lot focus efficiency hardware utilization thats embedded well another thing thats worth noting recall that investor day talked probably reached peak modernization spend jamie always says were always modernizing so fact weve gotten peak might come little bit still means were going constantly modernizing but margin means inside tech teams theres little bit capacity gets freed focus features new product development on also sense form efficiency 5']
"John McDonald, Analyst, Autonomous Research","Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc",Thanks.,"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf,4Q24,2025-01-15,['thanks'],['thanks'],"['yeah', 'noted', 'point', 'always', 'make', 'repeat', 'them', 'think', 'way', 're', 'thinking', 'right', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'notion', 'make', 'sense', 'nice', 'store', 'extra', 'capital', 'light', 'current', 'environment', 'believe', 'there', 'good', 'chance', 'moment', 'get', 'deploy', 'better', 'level', 'essentially', 'whatever', 'way', 'current', 'opportunity', 'would', 'suggest', 'feel', 'like', 'correct', 'kind', 'strategic', 'financial', 'decision', 'said', 'that', 'studied', 'quite', 'extensively', 'last', 'six', 'month', 'debate', 'would', 'expect', 've', 'concluded', 'enough', 'enough', 'excess', 'given', 'that', 'would', 'like', 'excess', 'grow', 'here', 'think', 'implication', 'that', 'given', 'amount', 'organic', 'capital', 'generation', 're', 'producing', 'mean', 'unless', 'find', 'near', 'term', 'opportunity', 'organic', 'deployment', 'otherwise', 'mean', 'capital', 'return', 'buyback', 'else', 'equal', 'order', 'arrest', 'growth', 'excess', 'current', 'plan', 'although', 'll', 'give', 'caveat', 'that', 'know', 'disclosure', 'want', 'get', 'business', 'guiding', 'buyback', 'reserve', 'right', 'change', 'trajectory', 'time', 'reason', 'current', 'thinking']",['so yeah noted points always make repeat them think way were thinking right feel comfortable notion makes sense us nice store extra capital light current environment believe theres good chance moment get deploy better levels essentially whatever way current opportunities would suggest feels like correct kind strategic financial decision us said that studied quite extensively last six months debates would expect weve concluded enough enough excess given that would like excess grow here so think implications that given amount organic capital generation were producing means unless find near term opportunities organic deployment otherwise means capital return buybacks else equal order arrest growth excess current plan although ill give caveat that know disclosure want get business guiding buybacks reserve right change trajectory time reason current thinking']

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year. 13",4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf,4Q24,2025-01-15,"['guess', 'thanks', 'that', 'sticking', 'that', 'far', 'concerned', 'talk', 'expert', 'like', 'one', 'know', 'right', 'level', 'fed', 'end', 'wondering', 'thought', 'fed', 'end', 'pressure', 'system', 'may', 'imply', 'deposit', 'growth']",['guess – thanks that sticking that far qt concerned talk experts like one knows right level fed end is im wondering thoughts fed end pressure system may imply deposit growth'],"['yeah', 'think', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'pretending', 'add', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'tapering', 'sort', 'complete', 'and', 'therefore', 'might', 'see', 'end', 'sometime', 'middle', 'year', 'course', 'may', 'change', 'that', 'seems', 'current', 'market', 'consensus', 'sort', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'look', 'h', 'data', 'kind', 'flow', 'fund', 'model', 'type', 'stuff', 'look', 'way', 'peer', 'behaving', 'evolution', 'expectation', 'economywide', 'loan', 'growth', 'cetera', 'impact', 'might', 'growth', 'systemwide', 'deposit', 'kind', 'consistent', 'story', 're', 'telling', 'sort', 'background', 'growth', 'nii', 'outlook', 'plus', 'minus', 'happens', 'policy', 'rate', 'stabilizing', 'growing', 'deposit', 'balance', 'second', 'half', 'year']",['yeah think conventional wisdom qt im pretending add conventional wisdom one way other tapering sort complete and therefore might see end sometime middle year course may change that seems current market consensus sort take step back look h8 data kind flow funds models type stuff look way peers behaving evolution qt expectations economy-wide loan growth et cetera impact might growth system-wide deposits kind consistent story were telling sort background growth nii outlook plus minus happens policy rate stabilizing growing deposit balances second half year 13']
"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

"Betsy L. Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.",4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf,4Q24,2025-01-15,"['guy', 'hear', 'okay', 'right', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'hear', 'great',

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,3Q24,2024-10-11,"['hey', 'good', 'morning', 'jeremy', 'highlighted', 'full', 'year', 'nii', 'guidance', 'implies', 'sizable',

"Steven Chubak, Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp. but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII.",jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,3Q24,2024-10-11,"['good', 'morning', 'jeremy', 'you', 'want', 'ask', 'expense', 'light', 'comment', 'daniel', 'made', 'recently', 'noting', 'consensus', 'expense', 'forecast', 'next', 'year', 'looked', 'little', 'bit', 'light', 'believe', 'time', 'billion', 'adjust', 'onetimers', 'year', 'would', 'suggest', 'core', 'expense', 'base', 'that', 'billion', 'pretty', 'healthy', 'stepup', 'expense', 'know', 'always', 'strong', 'commitment', 'discipline', 'around', 'investment', 'want', 'better', 'understand', 'incremental', 'dollar', 'deployed', 'investment', 'prioritized', 'particular', 'looking', 'next', 'year']",['hi good morning jeremy you want ask expenses light comments daniel made recently noting consensus expense forecast next year looked little bit light believe time $94 billion adjust one-timers year would suggest core expense base thats $90 billion pretty healthy step-up expenses know always strong commitment discipline around investment want better understand incremental dollars deployed investments prioritized particular looking next year'],"['sure', 'good', 'question', 'agree', 'number', 'agree', 'way', 'normalized', 'year', 'onetime', 'type', 'significant', 'item', 'also', 'consensus', 'daniel', 'made', 'comment', 're', 'would', 'also', 'remind', 'nii', 'comment', 'time', 'consensus', 'year', '', 'billion', 'next', 'year', 'billion', 'implying', 'time', 'sequential', 'decline', '', 'billion', 'felt', 'decline', 'big', 'enough', 'made', 'comment', 'made', 'happy', 'expand', 'that', 'anyway', 'expense', 'yeah', 'start', 'sake', 'argument', 'base', 'billion', 'obviously', 'inflation', 'normalizing', 'obviously', 're', 'always', 'trying', 'generate', 'efficiency', 'offset', 'inflation', 'but', 'said', 'assume', 'sake', 'argument', 'base', 'that', 'billion', 'dollar', 'right', 'gate', 're', 'working', 'against', 'that', 'one', 'thing', 'thing', 'continued', 'execute', 'growth', 'strategy', 'year', 'there', 'insignificant', 'amount', 'annualization', 'nt', 'quite', 'see', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'number', 'seasonality', 'incentive', 'comp', 'strip', 'out', 'would', 'see', 'probably', 'sequential', 'increase', 'annualization', 'additional', 'headwind', 'thing', 'that', 'worth', 'noting', 'expect', 'fee', 'volumerelated', 'business', 'grow', 'next', 'year', 'else', 'equal', 'would', 'come', 'higher', 'expense', 'loading', 'assemble', 'those', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'explain', 'sort', 'consensus', 'number', 'slightly', 'billion', 'seemed', 'light', 'term', 'priority', 'investment', 'really', 'nothing', 'changed', 'like', 'strategy', 'changed', 'strategy', 'changed', 'plan', 'changed', 're', 'kind', 'executing', 'longterm', 'perspective', 've', 'always', 'had', 'would', 'note', 'relative', 'nii', 'obviously', 're', 'third', 'quarter', 'now', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'old', 'day', 'used', 'give', 'guidance', 'investor', 'day', 'late', 'february', 'give', 'formal', 'expense', 'guidance', 'next', 'quarter', 'both', 'well', 'expense', 'nii', 'next', 'quarter', 'especially', 'expense', 'middle', 'budget', 'cycle', 'right', 'probably', 'little', 'less', 'visibility', 'margin', 'nii']",['sure good question agree numbers agree way normalized year one-time type significant items also consensus daniel made comments were it would also remind nii comments time consensus year $915 billion next year $90 billion implying time sequential decline $15 billion felt decline big enough made comments made happy expand that anyway expenses yeah start sake argument base $90 billion obviously inflation normalizing obviously were always trying generate efficiencies offset inflation but said assume 3% sake argument base thats billion dollars right gates were working against thats one thing thing continued execute growth strategies year theres insignificant amount annualization cant quite see fourth quarter numbers seasonality incentive comp strip out would see probably sequential increases annualization additional headwind thing thats worth noting expect fees volume-related businesses grow next year else equal would come higher expense loading assemble those goes long way explain sort consensus number slightly $94 billion seemed light terms priorities investments really nothing changed like strategy changed strategy changed plans changed were kind executing long-term perspective weve always had would note relative nii obviously were third quarter now fourth quarter old days used give guidance investor day late february give formal expense guidance next quarter both well expenses nii next quarter especially expenses middle budget cycle right probably little less visibility margin nii']

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very good. Appreciate the color and candor, as always. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected.

"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks. 14","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed.

"Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.

So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.","Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock.

And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios. 12 Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Got it. Thank you. Operator: Thank you.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock.

"Erika Najarian, Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?","Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don't know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable.

We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal.

"Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it's done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too. Glenn Schorr Analyst, Evercore ISI Q All right.

"Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this.

It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.

Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing.

"Betsy L. Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.,"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 18",jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,3Q24,2024-10-11,"['thank', 'much', 'operator', 'thank', 'you', 'final', 'question', 'come', 'saul', 'martinez', 'hsbc', 'line', 'open']",['thank much operator: thank you final question come saul martinez hsbc line open'],"['sure', 'yeah', 'thanks', 'question', 'saul', 'think', 'laid', 'building', 'block', 'already', 'simplicity', 'going', 'try', 'answer', 'question', 'without', 'referring', 'disclosed', 'ccb', 'deposit', 'margin', 'number', 'number', 'obviously', 'combination', 'rate', 'paid', 'ccb', 'deposit', 'internal', 'ftp', 'that', 'complicated', 'thing', 'evolves', 'function', 'modeling', 'beta', 'thing', 'think', 'actually', 'helpful', 'look', 'simply', 'firmwide', 'perspective', 'look', 'evolution', 'rate', 'paid', 'context', 'policy', 'rate', 'roughly', 'set', 'aside', 'duration', 'management', 'sort', 'factor', 'think', 'that', 'see', 've', 'saying', 'deposit', 'margin', 'defined', 'purpose', 'simply', 'difference', 'policy', 'rate', 'weightedaverage', 'rate', 'paid', 'consumer', 'deposit', 'unsustainably', 'high', 'going', 'correct', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'either', 'deposit', 'going', 'reprice', 'product', 'level', 'checking', 'saving', 'andor', 'going', 'see', 'ton', 'internal', 'migration', 'ie', 'growth', 'mix', 'andor', 'would', 'see', 'lower', 'policy', 'rate', 'sit', 'right', 'now', 'course', 'make', 'pricing', 'decision', 'context', 'market', 'competition', 'given', 'moment', 'looking', 'environment', 'deposit', 'needed', 'reprice', 'order', 'retain', 'primary', 'bank', 'relationship', 'also', 'core', 'strategy', 'never', 'going', 'chase', 'sort', 'hot', 'money', 'margin', 've', 'leaned', 'heavily', 'cd', 'gotten', 'current', 'level', 'mix', 'that', 'good', 'strategy', 'sit', 'now', 'margin', 'coming', 'result', 'policy', 'rate', 'coming', 'down', 'seems', 'that', 'put', 'pretty', 'comfortable', 'position', 'pricing', 'perspective', 'think', 'mix', 'probably', 'peaked', 'now', 'way', 'down', 'going', 'back', 'zero', 'beginning', 'cycle', 'that', 'important', 'thing', 'realize', 'else', 'equal', 'creates', 'little', 'bit', 'margin', 'compression', 'that', 'obviously', 'lower', 'yield', 'environment', 'mean', 'there', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'outflow', 'consumer', 'deposit', 'mentioned', 're', 'seeing', 'lot', 'less', 'yieldseeking', 'behavior', 'overlay', 'mentioned', 'longterm', 'share', 'growth', 'ccb', 'deposit', 'small', 'part', 'function', 'brand', 'strategy', 'buildout', 'fact', 'quarter', 'top', 'market', 'ccb', 'share', 'number', 'believe', 'there', 'big', 'opportunity', 'grow', 'rest', 'track', 'type', 'average', 'annual', 'share', 'growth', 'order', 'basis', 'point']",['sure yeah thanks question saul think laid building blocks already simplicity im going try answer question without referring disclosed ccb deposit margin number number obviously combination rate paid ccb deposits internal ftp that complicated thing evolves function modeling betas things think actually helpful look simply firmwide perspective look evolution rate paid context policy rates roughly set aside duration management sort factors think that see weve saying deposit margin defined purposes simply difference policy rate weighted-average rate paid consumer deposits unsustainably high going correct one way other either deposits going reprice product level checking savings and/or going see ton internal migration ie growth cd mix and/or would see lower policy rate sit right now course make pricing decisions context market competition given moment looking environment deposits needed reprice order retain primary bank relationships also core strategy never going chase sort hot money margin weve leaned heavily cds gotten current level cd mix thats good strategy sit now margin coming result policy rate coming down seems that puts us pretty comfortable position pricing perspective think cd mix probably peaked now way down going go back zero beginning cycle thats important thing realize else equal creates little bit margin compression that obviously lower yield environment mean theres little bit less outflow consumer deposits mentioned were seeing lot less yield-seeking behavior overlay mentioned long-term share growth ccb deposits small part function brand strategy buildout fact quarter top 125 markets ccb 15% share number believe theres big opportunity grow rest track type average annual share growth order 30 basis points 40 18']

"Betsy L. Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",Right.,"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts. 8",,,,jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,3Q24,2024-10-11,"['good', 'okay', 'question', 'ear', 'thing', 'say', 'there', 'already', 'mentioned', 'come', 'out', 'll', 'show', 'number', 'around', '', 'billion', 'important', 'thing', 'say', 'know', 'experience', 'rate', 'cycle', 'empirical', 'ear', 'meaningfully', 'higher', 'modeled', 'ear', 'disclose', 'main', 'reason', 'retail', 'deposit', 'beta', 'have', 'actuality', 'lower', 'modeled', 'deposit', 'beta', 'starting', 'point', 'kind', 'adjust', 'ear', 'number', 'bigger', 'reported', 'number', 'reason', 'actually', 'there', 'nuance', 'around', 'dollar', 'nondollar', 'sensitivity', 'interact', 'there', 'question', 'little', 'bit', 'frontend', 'versus', 'backend', 'see', 'actually', 'frontend', 'ear', 'gotten', 'smaller', 'ear', 'backend', 'definitely', 'case', 'that', 'else', 'equal', 'steeper', 'curve', 'better', 'think', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'kind', 'empirical', 'versus', 'theoretical', 'adjustment', 'disproportionately', 'frontend', 'therefore', 'order', 'answer', 'question', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'want', 'steeper', 'curve', 'fed', 'cut', 'what', 'currently', 'yield', 'curve', 'definitely', 'margin', 'context', 'next', 'year', 'number', 'headwind', 'would', 'headwind', 'remain', 'asset', 'sensitive', 'fed', 'cut']",['good okay question ear so things say there so already mentioned comes out itll show number around $21 billion important thing say is know experience rate cycle empirical ear meaningfully higher modeled ear disclose main reason retail deposit betas have actuality lower modeled deposit betas starting point kind adjust ear number bigger reported number reasons actually theres nuances around dollar non-dollar sensitivity interact theres question little bit front-end versus back-end so see actually front-end ear gotten smaller ear back-end so definitely case that else equal steeper curve better us think would also say kind empirical versus theoretical adjustment disproportionately front-end therefore order answer question would say yes want steeper curve fed cut whats currently yield curve definitely margin context next years numbers headwind – would headwind us remain asset sensitive fed cuts 8'],['nan'],['nan']

But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend.

"Saul Martinez, Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma'd SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things.

"Saul Martinez, Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie's not there, you can't speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor.

Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again.

So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year.

And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us. Glenn Schorr Analyst, Evercore ISI Q Super helpful.

Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Good morning.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that?

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII.

"Steven Chubak, Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak 5","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there.

"Steven Chubak, Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript-final.pdf,2Q24,2024-07-12,"['wanted', 'start', 'question',

And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away?

"Betsy L. Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that's what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it's consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. 12",jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript-final.pdf,2Q24,2024-07-12,"['want', 'ask', 'one', 'drilldown', 'question', 'related', 'dollar', 'amount', 'buyback', 'think', 'press', 'release', 'right', 'slide', 'deck', '', 'billion', 'common', 'stock', 'net', 'repurchase', 'question', 'what', 'governor', 'much', 'every', 'quarter', 'and', 'mean', 'understand', 'function', 'okay', 'much', 'organically', 'grow', 'even', 'that', 'get', 'organic', 'growth', 'nice', 'movement', 'there', 'organic', 'growth', 'much', 'earn', 'want', 'buy', 'back', 'earnings', 'thinking', 'repurchase', 'volume', 'looking', 'like', 'time', 'remember', 'investor', 'day', 'whole', 'debate', 'around', 'want', 'buy', 'back', 'stock', 'are', 'right', 'get', 'question', 'investor', 'quite', 'bit', 'thinking', 'think', 'right', 'amount', 'here']",['so want ask one drill-down question 2q related dollar amount buybacks do think press release right slide deck $49 billion common stock net repurchases so question is whats governor much every quarter and mean understand function of okay much organically grow even that get organic growth nice movement there organic growth much earn want buy back earnings thinking repurchase volume looking like time remember investor day whole debate around want buy back stock are right so get question investors quite bit thinking think right amount here'],"['yeah', 'that', 'good', 'fair', 'question', 'betsy', 'let', 'try', 'unpack', 'best', 'ability', 'particular', 'order', 'one', 'thing', 've', 'really', 'tried', 'emphasize', 'number', 'different', 'setting', 'including', 'recent', 'q', 'actually', 'want', 'get', 'business', 'guiding', 'buyback', 're', 'going', 'buy', 'back', 'whatever', 'think', 'make', 'sense', 'current', 'moment', 'sort', 'reserve', 'right', 'sort', 'change', 'time', 'recognize', 'everyone', 'love', 'that', 'kind', 'philosophical', 'belief', 'might', 'well', 'say', 'explicitly', 'pretty', 'clear', 'also', 'going', 'say', 'again', 'that', 'point', 'one', 'said', 'that', 'let', 'nonetheless', 'try', 'address', 'point', 'framework', 'governor', 'generally', 'speaking', 'think', 'make', 'sense', 'sort', 'exit', 'market', 'entirely', 'unless', 'condition', 'much', 'unusual', 'right', 'now', 'let', 'say', 'obviously', 'whatever', 'reason', 'ever', 'need', 'build', 'capital', 'hurry', 've', 'done', 're', 'always', 'comfortable', 'suspending', 'buyback', 'entirely', 'think', 'modest', 'amount', 'buyback', 'reasonable', 'thing', 'generating', 'kind', 'capital', 'talking', 'billion', 'pace', 're', 'kind', 'trying', 'move', 'away', 'notion', 'pace', 'that', 'idea', 'come', 'from', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'talked', '', 'billion', 'recognize', 'may', 'seem', 'like', 'little', 'bit', 'random', 'number', 'actually', 'come', 'statement', 've', 'made', 'significant', 'item', 'gain', 'visa', 'think', 'mean', 'mean', 'have', 'post', 'acceptance', 'exchange', 'offer', 'meaningful', 'long', 'position', 'liquid', 'large', 'cap', 'financial', 'stock', 'ie', 'visa', 'realistically', 'highly', 'correlated', 'stock', 'sense', 'carry', 'instead', 'buying', 'back', 'jpmorgan', 'stock', 'talked', 'jamie', 'talked', 'about', 'liquidate', 'visa', 'deploying', 'proceeds', 'jpm', 'that', 'quarter', '', 'billion', 'little', 'higher', 'consistent', 'comment', 'investor', 'day', 'around', 'slightly', 'increased', 'amount', 'buyback']",['yeah thats good fair question betsy so let try unpack best ability so particular order one thing weve really tried emphasize number different settings including recent 10-qs actually want get business guiding buybacks so were going buy back whatever think makes sense current moment sort reserve right sort change time so recognize everyone loves that kind philosophical belief so might well say explicitly pretty clear q also im going say again so thats point one said that let nonetheless try address point framework governors so generally speaking think make sense sort exit market entirely unless conditions much unusual right now lets say obviously whatever reason ever need build capital hurry weve done were always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely think modest amount buybacks reasonable thing generating kind capital so talking $2 billion pace were kind trying move away notion pace thats idea comes from lets put way talked $49 billion recognize may seem like little bit random number actually comes statement weve made significant item gains visa think means means have post acceptance exchange offer meaningful long position liquid large cap financial stock ie visa realistically highly correlated stock so sense carry instead buying back jpmorgan stock so talked – jamie talked about liquidate visa deploying proceeds jpm thats quarter so $49 billion little higher consistent comments investor day around slightly increased amount buybacks 12']

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest- bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they've steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn't focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e. quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds.

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front.

"Erika Najarian, Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the ""what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital"" and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame.

The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen?

"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.","Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome.

"John McDonald, Analyst, Autonomous Research","Analyst, Autonomous Research","Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex.

So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,1Q24,2024-04-12,"['hey', 'good', 'morning', 'jeremy', 'speak', 'trend', 'seeing', 'respect', 'deposit', 'migration', 'quarter', 'there', 'change', 'seen', 'migration', 'start', 'slow', 'not']",['hey good morning jeremy speak trends seeing respect deposit migration quarter theres change seen migration start slow not'],"['yeah', 'good', 'question', 'jim', 'think', 'simplest', 'best', 'answer', 'really', 've', 'saying', 'while', 'migration', 'checking', 'saving', 'cd', 'sort', 'dominant', 'trend', 'driving', 'increase', 'weighted', 'average', 'rate', 'paid', 'consumer', 'deposit', 'franchise', 'continues', 'continue', 'capture', 'moneyinmotion', 'high', 'rate', 're', 'happy', 'mean', 'consumer', 'franchise', 'level', 'engagement', 're', 'seeing', 'aware', 'there', 'little', 'bit', 'narrative', 'seeing', 'end', 'people', 'sometimes', 'refer', 'cash', 'sorting', 've', 'looked', 'data', 'see', 'evidence', 'maybe', 'slowing', 'little', 'bit', 're', 'quite', 'cautious', 'that', 'really', 'sort', 'think', 'make', 'sense', 'assume', 'world', 'checking', 'saving', 'paying', 'effectively', 'zero', 'policy', 'rate', 'going', 'see', 'ongoing', 'migration', 'frankly', 'expect', 'see', 'even', 'world', 'even', 'current', 'yield', 'curve', 'environment', 'change', 'meaningful', 'cut', 'get', 'reintroduced', 'would', 'actually', 'start', 'see', 'those', 'would', 'still', 'expect', 'see', 'ongoing', 'migration', 'yieldseeking', 'behavior', 'quite', 'conceivable', 'actually', 'yield', 'curve', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'six', 'cut', 'still', 'nonetheless', 'expecting', 'increase', 'weighted', 'average', 'rate', 'paid', 'migration', 'continues', 'would', 'say', 'meaningful', 'change', 'trend', 'expectation', 'ongoing', 'migration', 'much', 'still', 'there']",['yeah good question jim think simplest best answer is: really so weve saying while migration checking savings cds sort dominant trend driving increase weighted average rate paid consumer deposit franchise continues continue capture money-in-motion high rate were happy means consumer franchise level engagement were seeing im aware theres little bit narrative seeing end people sometimes refer cash sorting weve looked data see evidence maybe slowing little bit were quite cautious that really sort think makes sense assume world checking savings paying effectively zero policy rate 5% going see ongoing migration frankly expect see even world – even current yield curve environment change meaningful cuts get reintroduced would actually start see those would still expect see ongoing migration yield-seeking behavior so quite conceivable actually yield curve fourth quarter six cuts it still nonetheless expecting increase weighted average rate paid migration continues so would say meaningful change trends expectation ongoing migration much still there']

"Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in.

"Betsy L. Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre- CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules?

For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective. 15 Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

"Ken Usdin, Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, ""Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?"" For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. Charles W. Peabody Analyst, Portales Partners LLC Q As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.",,,,jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,1Q24,2024-04-12,"['okay', 'thanks', 'charlie', 'going', 'best', 'answer', 'question', 'sticking', 'sort', 'gun', 'giving', 'much', 'first', 'republic', 'specific', 'guidance', 'think', 'kind', 'framework', 'articulating', 'broadly', 'correct', 'let', 'piece', 'yes', 'current', 'quarter', 'result', 'annualized', 'billion', 'jamie', 'talked', 'about', 'yes', 'big', 'part', 'reason', 'discount', 'accretion', 'frontloaded', 'result', 'shortdated', 'asset', 'that', 'part', 'reason', 'see', 'converge', 'yes', 'also', 'true', 'expect', 'expense', 'run', 'rate', 'decline', 'later', 'year', 'continue', 'making', 'progress', 'integration', 'obviously', 'think', 'mentioned', 'last', 'quarter', 'full', 'year', 'perspective', 'offset', 'full', 'year', 'calendarization', 'effect', 'there', 'maybe', 'embedded', 'question', 'there', 'too', 'talked', '', 'billion', 'integration', 'expense', 'integration', 'real', 'expense', 'real', 'also', 'time', 'spent', 'quite', 'real', 'lot', 'work', 'lot', 'people', 'going', 'well', 're', 'done', 'yet', 'take', 'lot', 'effort', 'broadly', 'think', 'expectation', 'integration', 'expense', 'probably', 'coming', 'bit', 'lower', 'originally', 'assumed', 'morning', 'deal', 'couple', 'reason', 'one', 'framework', 'around', 'time', 'understandably', 'quite', 'conservative', 'sort', 'assumes', 'would', 'kind', 'lose', 'meaningful', 'portion', 'franchise', 'would', 'sort', 'need', 'size', 'expense', 'base', 'accordingly', 'course', 'worked', 'out', 'point', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'that', 'therefore', 'amount', 'expense', 'necessary', 'keep', 'bigger', 'franchise', 'higher', 'mean', 'less', 'integration', 'expense', 'associated', 'taking', 'number', 'probably', 'also', 'true', 'integration', 'assumption', 'conservative', 'based', 'kind', 'typical', 'type', 'bank', 'assumption', 'opposed', 'particular', 'nature', 'deal', 'including', 'fdic', 'forth', 'yeah', 'think', 'probably', 'pretty', 'complete', 'answer', 'question', 'thanks', 'charlie', 'charles', 'peabody', 'analyst', 'portales', 'partner', 'llc', 'quick', 'followup', 'next', 'homeruns', 'going', 'come', 'from', 'strategic', 'beyond', 'jpmorgan', 'probably', 'going', 'regional', 'bank', 'failure', 'whether', 'year', 'next', 'year', 'opportunity', 'pick', 'seeing', 'that', 'private', 'equity', 'family', 'office', 'setting', 'participate', 'next', 'round', 'bank', 'failure', 'mnuchin', 'buying', 'nycb', 'clearly', 'create', 'platform', 'rollups', 'failed', 'bank', 'family', 'office', 'filed', 'shelf', 'registration', 'bank', 'holding', 'company', 'whose', 'specific', 'purpose', 'buy', 'failed', 'bank', 'think', 'opportunity', 'going', 'competed', 'away', 'private', 'credit', 'part', 'that', 'think', 'regulator', 'going', 'view', 'private', 'credit', 'different', 'party', 'less', 'attractive', 'party', 'versus', 'bank', 'takeover', 'failed', 'bank', 'that', 'question']",['okay thanks charlie im going best answer question sticking sort guns giving much first republic specific guidance think kind framework articulating broadly correct so let go pieces yes current quarters results annualized $2 billion jamie talked about yes big part reason discount accretion frontloaded result short-dated assets so thats part reason see converge yes also true expect expense run rate decline later year continue making progress integration obviously think mentioned last quarter full year perspective offset full year calendarization effect theres maybe embedded question there too talked $25 billion integration expense integration real expenses real also time spent quite real lot work lot people going well were done yet;

Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open. Charles W. Peabody Analyst, Portales Partners LLC Q Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion?

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas.

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and  it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. 16",jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,1Q24,2024-04-12,"['good', 'thanks', 'notwithstanding', 'guy', 'outlook', 'uncertainty', 'course', 'jamie', 'talked', 'shareholder', 'letter', 'addressed', 'also', 'call', 'earlier', 'guy', 'share', 'share', 'color', 'what', 'going', 'corporate', 'lending', 'market', 'term', 'spread', 'seem', 'getting', 'tighter', 'reflecting', 'think', 'real', 'fear', 'global', 'geopolitical', 'world', 'color', 'guy', 'seeing', 'leveraged', 'loan', 'market', 'well']",['good thanks notwithstanding guys outlook uncertainty course jamie talked shareholder letter addressed also call earlier guys share share us color whats going corporate lending market terms spreads seem getting tighter reflecting think real fear global geopolitical world color guys seeing leveraged loan market well'],"['right', 'think', 'what', 'true', 'spread', 'general', 'broadly', 'credit', 'spread', 'including', 'secondary', 'market', 'extent', 'leverage', 'lending', 'space', 'exceptionally', 'tight', 'sure', 'that', 'reversed', 'little', 'bit', 'last', 'day', 'broadly', 'throughout', 'quarter', 've', 'really', 'seen', 'credit', 'spread', 'tighten', 'quite', 'bit', 'even', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'oci', 'quarter', 'loss', 'oci', 'would', 've', 'higher', 'rate', 'meaningfully', 'offset', 'tighter', 'credit', 'spread', 'portfolio', 'broadly', 'sort', 'keeping', 'big', 'runup', 'saw', 'equity', 'market', 'general', 'sort', 'bullish', 'tone', 'saw', 'quite', 'bit', 'credit', 'spread', 'tightening', 'secondary', 'market', 'that', 'think', 'manifested', 'little', 'bit', 'leverage', 'lending', 'space', 'normal', 'way', 'doe', 'there', 'lot', 'competition', 'among', 'provider', 'revenue', 'pool', 'start', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'loosening', 'term', 'always', 'make', 'little', 'bit', 'concerned', 'past', 'going', 'well', 'prepared', 'lose', 'share', 'space', 'like', 'term', 'never', 'compromise', 'structure', 'there', 'seeing', 'little', 'bit', 'that', 'think', 'that', 'away', 'leverage', 'lending', 'space', 'broader', 'space', 'moment', 'month', 'ago', 'think', 'small', 'part', 'result', 'bank', 'generally', 'anticipating', 'challenging', 'capital', 'environment', 'sort', 'disciplining', 'little', 'bit', 'lending', 'seeing', 'little', 'bit', 'widening', 'actually', 'corporate', 'lending', 'spread', 'know', 'trend', 'like', 'survived', 'last', 'week', 'little', 'bit', 'hard', 'observe', 'case', 'would', 'say', 'broadly', 'dynamic', 'tension', 'people', 'trying', 'careful', 'balance', 'sheet', 'fact', 'overall', 'asset', 'price', 'condition', 'quite', 'supportive', 'secondary', 'market', 'credit', 'spread', 'rallied', 'lot']",['right so think whats true spreads general broadly credit spreads including secondary markets extent leverage lending space exceptionally tight so im sure thats reversed little bit last days broadly throughout quarter weve really seen credit spreads tighten quite bit even see little bit oci quarter losses oci wouldve higher rates meaningfully offset tighter credit spreads portfolio broadly sort keeping big run-up saw equity markets general sort bullish tone saw quite bit credit spread tightening secondary markets that think manifested little bit leverage lending space normal way does theres lot competition among providers revenue pool start see little bit loosening terms always makes us little bit concerned past going well prepared lose share space like terms never compromise structure there so seeing little bit that think that away leverage lending space broader c&i space moment months ago think small part result banks generally anticipating challenging capital environment sort disciplining little bit lending seeing little bit widening actually corporate lending spreads know trend like survived last weeks little bit hard observe case would say broadly dynamics tension people trying careful balance sheets fact overall asset prices conditions quite supportive secondary market credit spreads rallied lot 16']

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. Glenn Schorr Analyst, Evercore ISI Q Cool.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don't go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive. Manan Gosalia Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q Great.

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share.

You may proceed.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,4Q23,2024-01-12,"['okay', 'thanks', 'operator', 'next', 'll', 'line', 'jim', 'mitchell', 'seaport', 'global', 'security', 'may', 'proceed']",['okay thanks 6 operator: next well go line jim mitchell seaport global securities may proceed'],"['yeah', 'good', 'question', 'let', 'reprice', 'first', 'think', 'else', 'equal', 'dovish', 'fed', 'environment', 'six', 'cut', 'effect', 'taking', 'little', 'bit', 'pressure', 'reprice', 'especially', 'productlevel', 'reprice', 'time', 'continue', 'expect', 'internal', 'migration', 'particularly', 'checking', 'saving', 'cd', 'wholesale', 'little', 'bit', 'ongoing', 'migration', 'noninterestbearing', 'interestbearing', 'trajectory', 'would', 'expect', 'continue', 'even', 'lower', 'rate', 'environment', 'result', 'look', 'weighted', 'average', 'rate', 'paid', 'example', 'consumer', 'deposit', 'franchise', 'would', 'actually', 'expect', 'number', 'little', 'bit', 'higher', 'even', 'world', 'six', 'cut', 'that', 'actually', 'intuitive', 'think', 'people', 'continue', 'migrating', 'cd', 'maybe', 'little', 'nonintuitive', 'kind', 'trying', 'beta', 'type', 'math', 'like', 'change', 'rate', 'change', 'rate', 'paid', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'nonintuitive', 'then', 'term', 'balance', 'yeah', 'note', 'said', 'outlook', 'balance', 'modestly', 'down', 'consider', 'despite', 'various', 'speculation', 'slow', 'later', 'year', 'continues', 'loan', 'growth', 'system', 'whole', 'expected', 'quite', 'muted', 'pretty', 'modest', 'decline', 'outlook', 'consistent', 'lower', 'rate', 'kind', 'agree', 'environment', 'margin', 'little', 'bit', 'supportive', 'systemwide', 'deposit', 'balance', 'then', 'obviously', 'continue', 'optimistic', 'ability', 'take', 'share', 'deposit', 'based', 'customer', 'value', 'proposition', 'across', 'different', 'business']",['yeah good questions lets reprice first so think else equal dovish fed environment six cuts effect taking little bit pressure reprice especially product-level reprice time continue expect internal migration particularly checking savings cds wholesale little bit ongoing migration non-interest-bearing interest-bearing trajectory would expect continue even lower rate environment so result look weighted average rate paid example consumer deposit franchise would actually expect number little bit higher even world six cuts thats actually intuitive think it people continue migrating cds maybe little non-intuitive kind trying beta type math like change rates change rate paid gets little bit non-intuitive then terms balances yeah note said outlook balances modestly down consider qt despite various speculations slow later year continues loan growth system whole expected quite muted pretty modest decline outlook consistent lower rates so kind agree environment margin little bit supportive system-wide deposit balances then obviously continue optimistic ability take share deposits based customer value proposition across different businesses']

What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit.

"Erika Najarian, Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. 9",jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,4Q23,2024-01-12,"['thank', 'you', 'operator', 'next', 'll', 'line',

I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor?

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients.

"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['hey', 'good', 'morning', 'first', 'question', 'jeremy', 'credit', 'think', 'mentioned', 'reserve', 'release', 'tied', 'change', 'central', 'scenario', 'talk', 'remind', 'central', 'scenario', 'today', 'changed', 'term', 'fundamentally', 'credit', 'like', 'seeing', 'softness', 'either', 'consumer', 'commercial', 'side']",['hey good morning first question jeremy credit think mentioned reserves release tied change central scenario talk us remind us central scenario today changed terms fundamentally credit like seeing softness either consumer commercial side'],"['yeah', 'central', 'scenario', 'read', 'research', 'get', 'put', 'competitor', 'excellent', 'research', 'team', 'seriousness', 'think', 'u', 'economist', 'central', 'case', 'outlook', 'include', 'mild', 'recession', 'think', 'two', 'quarter', 'negative', 'half', 'percent', 'gdp', 'growth', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'first', 'quarter', 'year', 'got', 'revised', 'early', 'quarter', 'sort', 'modest', 'growth', 'think', 'around', 'quarter', '', 'flowing', 'process', 'acknowledging', 're', 'still', 'skewed', 'downside', 're', 'still', 'reserved', 'significantly', 'higher', 'unemployment', 'rate', 'weightedaverage', 'basis', 'central', 'case', 'outlook', 'number', 've', 'sometimes', 'given', '', 'quarter', 'really', 'much', 'complicated', 'that', 're', 'kind', 'following', 'process', 'think', 'question', 'seeing', 'softness', 'credit', 'think', 'answer', 'actually', 'nowhere', 'roughly', 're', 'certainly', 'nowhere', 'that', 'expected', 'meaning', 'continue', 'see', 'normalization', 'story', 'play', 'consumer', 'less', 'exactly', 'expected', 'course', 'seeing', 'trickle', 'chargeoffs', 'coming', 'office', 'space', 'see', 'chargeoff', 'number', 'commercial', 'bank', 'number', 'small', 'less', 'realization', 'allowance', 've', 'already', 'built', 'there']",['yeah central scenario read research gets put competitors excellent research team no seriousness think us economists central case outlook include mild recession think two quarters negative half percent gdp growth fourth quarter first quarter year got revised early quarter sort modest growth think around 1% quarters 2024 so flowing process acknowledging were still skewed downside were still reserved significantly higher unemployment rate weighted-average basis central case outlook number weve sometimes given 55% quarter so really much complicated that were kind following process think question seeing softness credit think answer actually nowhere roughly were certainly nowhere thats expected meaning continue see normalization story play consumer less exactly expected course seeing trickle charge-offs coming office space see charge-off number commercial bank numbers small less realization allowance weve already built there']
"John McDonald, Analyst, Autonomous Research","Analyst, Autonomous Research","Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that's sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects.

Good question.

We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter.

"Steven Chubak, Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color in the slides, so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value destructive but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be.

And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know.

Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those.

So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don't know when.

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['good', 'follow', 'tie', 'answer', 'deposit', 'margin', 'consumer', 'earlier', 'comment', 'jamie', 'internal', 'debate', 'inside', 'jpmorgan', 'migration', 'rate', 'going', 'higher', 'funding', 'side', 'noninterestbearing', 'deposit', 'think', 'around', 'total', 'deposit', 'slightly', 'guy', 'back', 'prepandemic', 'expectation', 'going', 'see', 'noninterestbearing', 'deposit', 'interestbearing', 'repricing', 'interest', 'bearing', 'deposit', 'folk', 'inside', 'jpmorgan', 'little', 'cautious', 'net', 'interest', 'income', 'number']",['good follow up ties answer deposit margin consumer earlier comments jamie internal debate inside jpmorgan migration rates going higher funding side non-interest-bearing deposits think around 28% total deposits slightly 26% guys back 2018 2019 pre-pandemic expectation going see non-interest-bearing deposits go interest-bearing or repricing interest- bearing deposits folks inside jpmorgan little cautious net interest income number'],"['yeah', 'good', 'question', 'gerard', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'bigger', 'picture', 'that', 'sure', 'get', 'question', 'good', 'question', 'sure', 'reported', 'interestbearing', 'noninterestbearing', 'split', 'best', 'lens', 'look', 'couple', 'reason', 'first', 'like', 'wholesale', 'retail', 've', 'got', 'amount', 'noninterestbearing', 'wholesale', 'that', 'part', 'ecr', 'product', 'see', 'dynamic', 'play', 'out', 'consumer', 'world', 'saving', 'paying', 'relatively', 'lowrate', 'paid', 'crosschecking', 'saving', 'migration', 'dynamic', 'probably', 'different', 'right', 'now', 'course', 'even', 'within', 'consumer', 'across', 'consumer', 'small', 'business', 'got', 'slightly', 'different', 'dynamic', 'term', 'people', 'manage', 'operating', 'balance', 'would', 'tend', 'zoom', 'little', 'bit', 'see', 'holistic', 'answer', 'that', 'driven', 'internal', 'migration', 'checking', 'saving', 'cd', 'ecr', 'interestbearing', 'wholesale', 'potential', 'response', 'rate', 'environment', 'competitive', 'environment', 'overall', 'level', 'systemwide', 'deposit', 'term', 'product', 'level', 'reprice', 'may', 'may', 'happen', 'moment', 'future']",['yeah good question gerard think little bit bigger picture that im sure – get questions good question im sure reported interest-bearing non-interest-bearing split best lens look couple reasons first like wholesale retail weve got amount non-interest-bearing wholesale thats part ecr product see dynamics play out consumer world savings paying relatively low-rate paid cross-checking savings migration dynamics probably different right now course even within consumer across consumers small businesses got slightly different dynamics terms people manage operating balances would tend zoom little bit see holistic answer thats driven internal migration checking savings cds ecr interest-bearing wholesale potential response rate environment competitive environment overall level system-wide deposits terms product level reprice may may happen moments future']

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.

"Erika Najarian, Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",,,,jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['simple', 'term', 'talk', 'earnings', 'power', 'return', 'they', 're', 'two', 'different', 'thing', 'right', 'little', 'bit', 'pedantic', 'numerator', 'denominator', 'here', 'okay', 'say', 'numerator', 'change', 'dilute', 'numerator', 'increased', 'capital', 'that', 'significantly', 'lower', 'return', 'number', 'would', 'say', 'that', 'probably', 'lower', 'bound', 'term', 'impact', 'basel', 'iii', 'endgame', 'couple', 'reason', 'one', 'hoping', 'change', 'two', 'rule', 'final', 'seek', 'reprice', 'place', 'can', 'different', 'consumer', 'wholesale', 'product', 'level', 'relationship', 'level', 'hopefully', 'mitigate', 'course', 'flip', 'side', 'that', 'cost', 'getting', 'passed', 'real', 'economy', 'that', 'part', 'point', 've', 'made', 'lowering', 'availability', 'product', 'service', 'lending', 'may', 'opportunity', 'costless', 'optimization', 'personally', 'little', 'bit', 'pessimistic', 'those', 've', 'surprised', 'point', 'past', 'll', 'see', 'finally', 'yeah', 'may', 'stop', 'certain', 'thing', 'may', 'exit', 'thing', 'but', 'necessarily', 'assume', 'that', 'going', 'lot', 'preserve', 'return', 'that', 'going', 'exiting', 'thing', 'shareholderdestructive', 'necessarily', 'producing', 'much', 'higher', 'return', 'know', 'mean', 'that', 'that', 'part', 'question', 'implicitly', 'talking', 'organic', 'capital', 'generation', 'think', 'important', 'separate', 'impact', 'economy', 'impact', 'longterm', 'return', 'ability', 'meet', 'requirement', 'course', 'jamie', 'always', 'say', 'jpmorgan', 'going', 'fine', 're', 'building', 'lot', 'capital', 'managing', 'capital', 'conservatively', 'll', 'able', 'build', 'necessary', 'capital', 'order', 'achieve', 'ontime', 'early', 'compliance', 'always', 'strive', 'really', 'particular', 'bearing', 'question', 'longterm', 'return', 'target', 'impact', 'real', 'economy']",['simple terms talk earnings power returns theyre two different things right little bit pedantic numerator denominator here okay say numerator change dilute numerator increased capital thats significantly lower return number would say thats probably lower bound terms impact basel iii endgame couple reasons one is hoping changes two is rule final seek reprice places can different consumer wholesale product level relationship level hopefully mitigate course flip side thats cost getting passed real economy thats part point weve made lowering availability products services lending may opportunities costless optimization im personally little bit pessimistic those weve surprised points past well see finally yeah may stop certain things may exit things but necessarily assume thats going lot preserve returns 17% thats going exiting things shareholder-destructive necessarily producing much higher returns know mean thats that part question implicitly talking organic capital generation think important separate impacts economy impacts long-term returns ability meet requirements course jamie always says jpmorgan going fine were building lot capital managing capital conservatively well able build necessary capital order achieve on-time early compliance always strive do really particular bearing question long-term return target impacts real economy'],['nan'],['nan']

I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution. 14",,,,jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['want', 'start', 'okay', 'mean', 'green', 'shoot', 'note', 'comment', 'cautious', 'mean', 'momentum', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'optimistic', 'were', 'obviously', 'market', 'bumpy', 'equity', 'market', 'rate', 'market', 'whippy', 'recently', 'want', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'optimism', 'here', 'coming', 'low', 'base', 'there', 'hope', 'expectation', 'path', 'normalization', 'improvement', 'course', 'overall', 'economic', 'picture', 'least', 'currently', 'look', 'solid', 'sort', 'immaculate', 'disinflation', 'trade', 'actually', 'happening', 'reason', 'little', 'bit', 'optimistic', 'nearterm', 'tempered', 'quite', 'bit', 'caution']",['want start okay so mean green shoots note comments cautious mean momentum think little bit optimistic were obviously markets bumpy equity markets rate markets whippy recently want get carried away optimism here coming low base theres hope expectation path normalization improvement course overall economic picture least currently looks solid sort immaculate disinflation trade actually happening reasons little bit optimistic near-term tempered quite bit caution 14'],['nan'],['nan']
"Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.

But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Right. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn't balloon the costs when the revenue became as we've argued unsustainably high. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher-than- expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there? 18",jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['right', 'that', 'helpful', 'thanks', 'operator', 'thank', 'you', 'last', 'question', 'come', 'matt', 'oconnor', 'deutsche', 'bank', 'line', 'open', 'matt', 'oconnor', 'analyst', 'deutsche', 'bank', 'security', 'inc', 'good', 'morning', 'talked', 'increased', 'investment', 'spend', 'area', 'response', 'earlier', 'question', 'think', 'cost', 'control', 'overall', 'looking', 'medium', 'term', 'outlook', 'revenue', 'obviously', 'pressured', 'least', 'net', 'interest', 'income', 'fee', 'might', 'help', 'backdrop', 'potentially', 'declining', 'revenue', 'least', 'flattish', 'revenue', 'couple', 'year', 'know', 'always', 'say', 'want', 'invest', 'cycle', 'really', 'paid', 'time', 'thinking', 'cost', 'control', 'next', 'year']",['right thats helpful thanks operator: thank you last question comes matt oconnor deutsche bank line open matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc q hi good morning talked increased investment spend areas response earlier question think cost control overall looking medium term outlook revenue obviously pressured least net interest income fees might help backdrop potentially declining revenue least flattish revenue couple years so know always say want invest cycle really paid time thinking cost control next years'],"['yeah', 'mean', 'wish', 'sort', 'answer', 'fit', 'better', 'framework', 'fundamental', 'sense', 'kind', 'agree', 'framework', 'sense', 've', 'last', 'couple', 'year', 'right', 'world', 'rate', 'drop', 'suddenly', 'recover', 'like', 'quite', 'dramatically', 'credit', 'becomes', 'abnormally', 'good', 'rebound', 'seen', 'significant', 'fluctuation', 'capital', 'market', 'saw', 'going', 'revenue', 'environment', 'change', 'lot', 'short', 'term', 'reason', 'largely', 'control', 'course', 'part', 'expense', 'base', 'short', 'term', 'directly', 'sensitive', 'revenue', 'environment', 'adjust', 'naturally', 'adjust', 'forcefully', 'function', 'volume', 'thing', 'much', 'structural', 'goal', 'make', 'sure', 'thing', 'sized', 'appropriately', 'believe', 'sustainable', 'cycle', 'return', 'are', 're', 'always', 'focused', 'cost', 'rest', 'assured', 'that', 'discipline', 'internally', 'aggressive', 'ever', 'budget', 'cycle', 'longterm', 'play', 'really', 'expect', 'see', 'trying', 'generate', 'cosmetically', 'lower', 'cost', 'response', 'lower', 'revenue', 'environment', 'balloon', 'cost', 'revenue', 'became', 've', 'argued', 'unsustainably', 'high', 'matt', 'oconnor', 'analyst', 'deutsche', 'bank', 'security', 'inc', 'yeah', 'fair', 'enough', 'could', 'squeeze', 'first', 'republic', 'obviously', 'contribution', 'coming', 'multiple', 'higherthan', 'expected', 'think', 'put', 'take', 'term', 'think', 'there', 'probably', 'runoff', 'loan', 'still', 'come', 'also', 'opportunity', 'deepen', 'relationship', 'there']",['yeah mean wish sort answer fit better framework fundamental sense kind agree framework sense weve last couple years right world rates drop suddenly recover like quite dramatically credit becomes abnormally good rebounds seen significant fluctuations capital markets saw 2021 going 2022 revenue environment change lot short term reasons largely control course parts expense base short term directly sensitive revenue environment adjust naturally adjust forcefully function volumes things much structural goal make sure things sized appropriately believe sustainable cycle returns are were always focused cost rest assured that discipline internally aggressive ever go budget cycle long-term plays really expect us see trying generate cosmetically lower costs response lower revenue environment balloon costs revenue became weve argued unsustainably high matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc q yeah fair enough could squeeze first republic obviously contribution coming multiples higher-than- expected think puts takes terms of think theres probably run-off loans still come also opportunities deepen relationships there 18']

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?","Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do. 17",jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,3Q23,2023-10-13,"['okay', 'change', 'talked', 'potential', 'negative', 'impact', 'liquidity', 'market', 'business', 'specifically', 'jpm', 'pulling', 'certain', 'business', 'type', 'event', 'comment', 'there', 'fewer', 'provider', 'liquidity', 'less', 'scaled', 'player', 'exit', 'maybe', 'that', 'almost', 'equal', 'market', 'share', 'gain', 'opportunity', 'jpmorgan', 'smaller', 'business']",['okay change talked potential negative impact liquidity markets business specifically jpm pulling certain businesses type event comment thered fewer providers liquidity less scaled players exit maybe thats almost equal market share gain opportunity jpmorgan smaller business'],"['think', 'look', 'market', 'alone', 'huge', 'think', 'increase', 'capital', 'look', 'product', 'product', 'worse', 'others', 'generally', 'bad', 'across', 'product', 'really', 'important', 'thing', 'market', 'making', 'critical', 'function', 'look', 'world', 'large', 'market', 'maker', 'could', 'make', 'market', 'government', 'hospital', 'city', 'school', 'state', 'imf', 'world', 'bank', 'blackrock', 'blackstone', 'various', 'thing', 'buy', 'sell', 'client', 'size', 'market', 'maker', 'different', 'function', 'hedge', 'fund', 'know', 'real', 'intent', 'this', 'another', 'one', 'think', 'need', 'really', 'thought', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'market', 'making', 'quite', 'safe', 've', 'never', 'lost', 'kind', 'money', 'people', 'talk', 'market', 'making', 'global', 'market', 'shock', 'something', 'like', 'that', 'thing', 'market', 'making', 'agree', 'could', 'actually', 'force', 'people', 'out', 'force', 'lower', 'position', 'think', 'little', 'risky', 'may', 'also', 'force', 'consolidation', 'client', 'since', 'need', 'much', 'may', 'consolidation', 'unintended', 'way', 'market', 'making', 'obviously', 'volatile', 'market', 'constraint', 'lcr', 'slr', 'capital', 'cetera', 'constantly', 'limitation']",['think look markets alone huge think 60% increase capital look it product products worse others generally bad across products really important thing market making critical function look world large market makers could make markets governments hospitals cities schools states imf world bank blackrock blackstone various things buy sell clients size market makers different function hedge funds know real intent this another one think needs really thought trying accomplish market making quite safe weve never lost kind money people talk market making global market shock something like that thing market making agree could actually force people out force lower positions think little risky may also force consolidation clients since need much may consolidation unintended way market making obviously volatile markets constraints lcr slr capital et cetera constantly limitations do 17']

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen.

"Steven Chubak, Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr Analyst, Evercore ISI Q Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there'd be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it? Glenn Schorr Analyst, Evercore ISI Q Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.

"Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Alright. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we've obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",2q23-earnings-transcript.pdf,2Q23,2023-07-14,"['alright', 'thank', 'you', 'operator', 'next', 'll', 'line', 'steven', 'chubak', 'wolfe', 'research', 'may', 'proceed']",['alright thank you operator: next well go line steven chubak wolfe research may proceed'],"['yeah', 'good', 'question', 'steve', 'let', 'say', 'couple', 'thing', 'this', 'obviously', 'deposit', 'number', 'bounced', 'around', 'little', 'bit', 'function', 'turmoil', 'saw', 'regional', 'bank', 'well', 'obviously', 'first', 'republic', 'transaction', 'now', 'look', 'kind', 'endofperiod', 'deposit', 'quarter', 'project', 'forward', 'core', 'view', 'would', 'expect', 'sort', 'modest', 'downward', 'trend', 'reassert', 'higher', 'starting', 'point', 'broadly', 'function', 'playing', 'system', 'noting', 'hope', 'offset', 'taking', 'share', 'give', 'couple', 'example', 'like', 'consumer', 've', 'got', 'branch', 'expansion', 'market', 'seasoning', 'share', 'opportunity', 'there', 'wholesale', 've', 'obviously', 'invested', 'lot', 'product', 'service', 'think', 'compelling', 'offering', 'helping', 'win', 'mandate', 'potentially', 'share', 'offset', 'there', 'broadly', 'core', 'view', 'remains', 'modest', 'deposit', 'decline', 'across', 'franchise', 'within', 'that', 'note', 'thing', 've', 'noted', 'got', 'debt', 'ceiling', 'tga', 'build', 'come', 'effect', 'seen', 'lot', 'bill', 'issuance', 'big', 'question', 'market', 'whether', 'going', 'come', 'reserve', 'come', 'rrp', 'far', 'tga', 'build', 'guess', 'they', 're', 'targeting', 'billion', 'they', 're', 'billion', 'something', 'they', 're', 'almost', 'done', 'people', 'feared', 'come', 'rrp', 'say', 'think', 'that', 'relatively', 'good', 'sign', 'highlight', 'system', 'work', 'better', 'got', 'ample', 'supply', 'shortdated', 'collateral', 'front', 'end', 'yield', 'curve', 'whole', 'rrptga', 'bank', 'reserve', 'dynamic', 'going', 'continue', 'significant', 'good', 'see', 'rrp', 'coming', 'little', 'bit']",['yeah good question steve let say couple things this obviously deposit numbers bounced around little bit function turmoil saw regional banks well obviously first republic transaction now look kind end-of-period deposits quarter project forward core view would expect sort modest downward trend re-assert higher starting point broadly function qt playing system noting hope offsets taking share give couple examples like consumer weve got branch expansion markets seasoning share opportunities there wholesale weve obviously invested lot products services think compelling offerings helping us win mandates potentially share offsets there broadly core view remains modest deposit declines across franchise within that note thing weve noted got debt ceiling tga build come effect seen lot bill issuance big question market whether going come reserves come rrp far tga build – guess theyre targeting $600 billion theyre $550 billion – something theyre almost done people feared come rrp say think thats relatively good sign highlights system works better got ample supply short-dated collateral front end yield curve whole rrp/tga bank reserve dynamic going continue significant good see rrp coming little bit']

Please go ahead.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling.

"Jim Mitchell, Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. 5 Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",2q23-earnings-transcript.pdf,2Q23,2023-07-14,"['okay', 'great', 'thanks', 'operator', 'next', 'll', 'line', 'erika', 'najarian', 'ubs', 'may', 'proceed']",['okay great thanks 5 operator: next well go line erika najarian ubs may proceed'],"['yeah', 'thanks', 'erika', 'mean', 'good', 'question', 'there', 'lot', 'there', 'obviously', 'guess', 'would', 'start', 'saying', 'talked', 'throughthecycle', 'rotce', 'even', 'though', 'may', 'introduced', 'moment', 'lower', 'zero', 'bound', 'always', 'premised', 'sort', 'normalized', 'rate', 'environment', 'level', 'remains', 'true', 'today', 'furthermore', 'ask', 'explicitly', 'context', 'proposed', 'basel', 'iii', 'endgame', 'one', 'relevant', 'question', 'might', 'lot', 'capital', 'denominator', 'happens', 'target', 'think', 'said', 'prepared', 'remark', 'feel', 'confident', 'company', 'ability', 'produce', 'excellent', 'return', 'cycle', 'there', 'lot', 'moving', 'part', 'right', 'that', 'could', 'good', 'could', 'bad', 'narrowly', 'capital', 'one', 'one', 'thing', 'point', 'straightup', 'math', 'simply', 'diluting', 'rotce', 'expanding', 'denominator', 'miss', 'possibility', 'reprice', 'repricing', 'product', 'service', 'course', 'go', 'back', 'point', 'capital', 'increase', 'impact', 'real', 'economy', 're', 'suggesting', 'price', 'way', 'obviously', 'need', 'get', 'right', 'return', 'product', 'service', 'pricing', 'power', 'adjust', 'higher', 'capital', 'lot', 'moving', 'part', 'there', 'think', 'important', 'point', 'range', 'scenario', 'feel', 'good', 'ability', 'deliver', 'good', 'result', 'll', 'see', 'mix', 'various', 'factor', 'play', 'especially', 'see', 'basel', 'iii', 'proposal', 'comment', 'period']",['yeah thanks erika mean good question theres lot there obviously guess would start saying talked 17% through-the-cycle rotce even though may introduced moment lower zero bound always premised sort normalized rate environment level remains true today furthermore ask explicitly context proposed basel iii endgame one relevant question might lot capital denominator happens target think said prepared remarks feel confident companys ability produce excellent returns cycle theres lot moving parts right that; could good could bad narrowly capital one one thing point straight-up math simply diluting rotce expanding denominator misses possibility reprice repricing products services course goes back point capital increases impacts real economy were suggesting price way it obviously need get right returns products services pricing power adjust higher capital lot moving parts there think important point range scenarios feel good ability deliver good results well see mix various factors plays especially see basel iii proposal go comment period']

So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business.

I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card.

"Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",2q23-earnings-transcript.pdf,2Q23,2023-07-14,"['good', 'morning', 'guess', 'first', 'question', 'following', 'outlook', 'economy', 'like', 've', 'worried', 'recession', 'year', 'there', 'debate', 'lagged', 'effect', 'fed', 'rate', 'hike', 'cycle', 'think', 'jeremy', 'think', 'mentioned', 'unemployment', 'outlook', 'relatively', 'similar', 'today', 'versus', 'quarter', 'ago', 'worried', 'term', 'credit', 'cycle', 'month', 'now', 'leaning', 'towards', 'concluding', 'maybe', 'u', 'business', 'consumer', 'absorbed', 'rate', 'cycle', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'year', 'ago']",['good morning guess first question following outlook economy like weve worried recession year theres debate lagged effects fed rate hike cycle think – jeremy think mentioned unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus quarter ago – worried terms credit cycle 6 12 months now leaning towards concluding maybe us businesses consumers absorbed rate cycle lot better expected year ago'],"['yeah', 'mean', 'sure', 'jamie', 'view', 'here', 'view', 'would', 'caution', 'jumping', 'many', 'superpositive', 'conclusion', 'based', 'couple', 'recent', 'print', 'think', 'generally', 'point', 'less', 'trying', 'predict', 'particular', 'outcome', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'much', 'euphoria', 'overconcentrates', 'people', 'one', 'particular', 'prediction', 'know', 'there', 'range', 'outcome', 'there', 'obviously', 'people', 'talking', 'lot', 'potential', 'softlanding', 'right', 'now', 'landing', 'immaculate', 'disinflation', 'whatever', 'whether', 'view', 'changed', 'meaningfully', 'know', 'broader', 'point', 'continue', 'quite', 'focused', 'jamie', 'prior', 'comment', 'loss', 'rate', 'still', 'room', 'normalize', 'even', 'postpandemic', 're', 'probably', 'overearning', 'credit', 'little', 'bit', 'obviously', 've', 'talked', 'expectation', 'nii', 'going', 'come', 'quite', 'bit', 'even', 'forgetting', 'whether', 'get', 'surprisingly', 'negative', 'outcome', 'economy', 'stand', 'today', 'even', 'central', 'case', 'need', 'recognize', 'significant', 'normalization']",['yeah so mean im sure jamie views here view would caution jumping many super-positive conclusions based couple recent prints think generally point less trying predict particular outcome trying make sure get much euphoria over-concentrates people one particular prediction know theres range outcomes there obviously people talking lot potential soft-landing right now landing immaculate disinflation whatever whether views changed meaningfully know broader point continue quite focused jamies prior comment loss rates still room normalize even post-pandemic were probably over-earning credit little bit obviously weve talked expectation nii going come quite bit even forgetting whether get surprisingly negative outcomes economy stand today even central case need recognize significant normalization']

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees?

Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.

"Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook.

That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes.

So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing.

But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash –  so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.

"Ken Usdin, Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Analyst, Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way.

Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance 11","Jamie Dimon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one.

"Gerard Cassidy, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC","In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?","Jeremy Barnum, Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",1q23-earnings-transcript.pdf,1Q23,2023-04-14,"['comment', 'cet', 'ratio', 'obviously', 'came', 'strong', '', 'got', 'gsib', 'buffer', 'obviously', 'going', 'next', 'year', 'stress', 'test', 'coming', 'summer', 'june', 'result', 'maybe', 'lead', 'bank', 'including', 'yours', 'higher', 'stress', 'capital', 'buffer', 'think', 'cet', 'ratio', 'end', 'year', 'think']",['comments cet1 ratio obviously came strong 138% got gsib buffer obviously going next year stress test coming summer june – results – maybe lead banks including yours higher stress capital buffer think cet1 ratio end year think'],"['yeah', 'thing', 'there', 'gerard', 'previously', 'said', 'targeting', '', 'first', 'quarter', 'function', 'assuming', 'unchanged', 'scb', 'increased', 'gsib', 'step', 'operating', 'basispoint', 'buffer', 'point', 'jamie', 'made', 'second', 'ago', 'light', 'environment', 'basel', 'dry', 'powder', 'know', 'know', 'll', 'tweak', 'going', 'forward', 'that', 'still', 'base', 'case', 'assumption', 'specifically', 'stress', 'test', 'contrary', 've', 'heard', 'people', 'argue', 'ability', 'predict', 'scb', 'ahead', 'time', 'running', 'process', 'actually', 'quite', 'limited', 'remember', 'last', 'year', 'even', 'though', 'predict', 'increase', 'almost', 'factor', 'two', 'term', 'big', 'wound', 'being', 'big', 'surprise', 'whole', 'industry', 'want', 'quite', 'humble', 'ability', 'predict', 'scb', 'said', 'that', 'right', 'assuming', 'unchanged', 'tailwind', 'oci', 'believe', 'likely', 'offset', 'harsher', 'credit', 'shock', 'number', 'planning', 'purpose', 'right', 're', 'assuming', 'flat', 'scb', 'll', 'know', 'soon', 'enough', 'actual', 'number']",['yeah things there gerard previously said targeting 135% first quarter 2024 function assuming unchanged scb increased gsib step operating 50-basis-point buffer so point jamie made second ago light environment basel iv dry powder know knows well tweak going forward thats still base case assumption specifically stress test contrary ive heard people argue ability predict scb ahead time running process actually quite limited remember last year even though predict increase almost factor two terms big wound being big surprise whole industry so want quite humble ability predict scb said that right assuming unchanged tailwinds oci believe likely offsets harsher credit shocks number planning purposes right were assuming flat scb well know soon enough actual number is']
