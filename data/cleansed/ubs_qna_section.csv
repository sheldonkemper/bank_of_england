Unknown,,"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Very clear. Thanks. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Yeah. Thanks. Just two questions. The first one is related to the book value per share guidance that you gave of the 74% increase on day one. Just wondering if that still holds, first of all, at this point, or has that changed post your further analysis. And in that context, should we assume that the purchase accounting, restructuring, asset marks, etcetera, should be captured by the reserves that is being built off what we estimate 21 billion. The second question is in relation to more top down. How we should think about the impact on clients at this point and also retention of clients, especially in wealth management at this point already. And how we should think about retention of clients post the event, the clients that have left. How should we think about your position after that?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So, Sarah, take the first question. I'll take the second.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So, when we give you the 74%, we focused intentionally on what we viewed as economic impact, i.e. what impacts CET1 and if you continue to do it that way, actually the numbers are very stable. Of course, we are continuing to do the work on the PPA and we're going to continue to do so. And the PPA was, of course, included in the estimates that we had given you. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sorry if I may. The 74% also includes - but does clearly not include additional charges to the P&L and the rest comes to the P&L, we should assume.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"That's right. The initial PPA comes into the CET1 or the tangible book value per share, and anything that is beyond that comes through the P&L. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Ok.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So on client retention, I – maybe let me reiterate that if you look at our inflows and in general, we don't have an issue with our current clients. And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential to your plans because you’ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past: based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I’ like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of – for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,Thank you.,25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,"Yes. Good morning. The first question I wanted to ask you is regarding the net new money, so the net new FGA. You gave us some details you know including post the 10 business days that followed the announcement of the deal and thank you for that. I don't think I've seen any comment around the trend in April. So, just wanted to ask you know, what trend you've seen in terms of the customer behavior and especially regarding the NNFGA as well as customer deposits since the quarter ended about three weeks ago. And then I just wanted to come back to the risk around – the you know concentration risk around clients and the overlap on the client base. You made interesting comments regarding the fact that you are underweight certain client segment versus CS, and where you can gain from that transaction. There is another client segment which could lose. Can you maybe provide us more details? Do you mean in wealth management specifically, also in P&C? Can you maybe comment on those client segments? Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So, on the first question in terms of the trends of April, we really haven't seen anything that is particularly abnormal or special. And so, it is not our custom to guide and we will stay with that.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah. On the client side. I mean, if you look at, for example, in Asia, I think it’s clear that UBS has that perhaps a stronger franchise in North Asia and Credit Suisse has a stronger franchise, relatively speaking, in Southeast Asia. So, I think that the combination of the two is very complementary. Latin America, I mean, in Latin America, we definitely have a situation in which Credit Suisse brings a significant value to our platform. And there, that will make us, if not the leader of non-Latin American players, very close to that. So, a significant step forward. In respect of Switzerland, I would say that usually, SMEs have a relationship with maybe one of the large banks and with a cantonal bank or a regional bank. So, it’s – there is a high likelihood that the same SMEs don’t really have equal a relationship with the two large banks. For that reason, we believe that many of them can be captured. Same issue for retail and personal clients banking. If people have two relationships, usually they have it with a local bank and with a large bank. So, also there. And last but not least, I would say, that it’s fair to say that Credit Suisse has a strong franchise in large corporates in Switzerland, which is also complementary to our own. So, after all, as I say, both in terms of current business mix, but also going back to my remarks. In Switzerland, there are 250 banks. It’s plenty of competition, plenty of cantonal banks, plenty of Raiffeisen Banks. And, therefore, we believe that we will be able to manage this competitive landscape, which is not easy for us through service quality and what we can do differently than others rather than just purely size.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,Thank you.,25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Good morning. Two questions. Firstly, just on slide 10 in your revised net interest income outlook, Q1, you’ve seen a slight increase in NII. So then you are guiding to a mid-single digit decrease for Q2. So that implies Q2 will be slightly below the Q4 run rate. Implicitly, this seems to suggest that Q3, Q4 is roughly then going to be stable based on your full year guidance. So, I’m interested in your thoughts on the offset between rate hikes and then most important of all, deposit migration to money market funds in future quarters. Given that we’re closing in on peak rates, it seems to imply you’re achieving, the deposit migration also slows, but would welcome any commentary on that. And then my second question is actually on the liquidity coverage ratio. I think there’s an active debate as to whether it’s calibrated correctly in light of recent events, particularly the 10% weighting that’s applied to less stable retail deposits. So, interested in any conversations you’ve had on that either with FINMA or the Basel Committee. And likewise, does that mean you’re going to continue to run with an LCR of, you know, north of 160%, given the potential that that ratio might be recalibrated? Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So, on the first quarter or the first question, what you've seen is some very significant mix shift throughout the system, the $600 billion of Fed data showed that the whole system had a 3% sequential decrease that we still saw. That is not expected to be that dramatic going forward, but we certainly have planned for the annualization of that in our numbers. And then after that, you see some normal patterns that happened, but we continue to see some mix shifts, as you would expect, but potentially not at the level that was seen at the beginning of the year. It's also important to know that for us, it was really the beginning of the year that was that pattern. So, actually January and February where we saw a lot of mix shift and actually some of the net inflows into the platforms from deposits were in March. In terms of the second quarter guidance, you’ve noted that we’re going to be down and that is exactly correct with P&C being slightly up and GWM, which is where those mix shifts are happening, being a bit down. And then as you pointed out mathematically, that does mean that there is some level of stability over the course of the year thereafter. In terms of LCR, we believe that we are calibrated correctly because what you are seeing also is that for us, the changes in deposits have actually not done very much in terms of the change of LCR because we very much know what type of deposits are going to be sticky versus not sticky. And so, we calculate as such. And of course, you've seen us very consistently being at those high levels and we don't have an intention to drop sharply regardless of the dialogue that could happen around the LCR calculations.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citi,Thank you.,25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Morning. I've got two. One is a bit of a follow up on LCR and on your long-term funding strategy. Clearly, LCR standalone is pretty strong. If you look at the business you're acquiring, then it's really propped up by a big SNB liquidity line and that deposits are very, very low. Loans to deposit is 157%. So, I was just wondering how you're thinking about your long-term funding strategy through the acquisition and how you might deal with kind of the flight of deposits that they have seen and how you can integrate that into your liquidity model going forward. And then second on a slightly different topic. In GWM, you've got flat costs on lower revenues, and a favorable revenue mix with NII up and fees down. Normally, that is a good mix for your cost base. Could you just discuss a little bit more what's going on in there, what sort of inflation you're seeing, whether there is an increased competition for relationship managers, and whether that's changing given the new environment? Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So on the LCR and more generally the funding plan, as we integrate CS today they are user of the SNB facilities. It will be our intention certainly to manage that down as quickly as possible, but recognizing the gap that you're pointing out. And we will indicate that as soon as ready. In terms of the GWM story, what you're seeing is, as noted, a very strong NII performance. In asset based, it is the combination of the markets levels as well as a little bit of the margin compression that has happened over the year, which is just a mix topic that we have discussed. And then in terms of the transaction activity, not yet very elevated, just based on the level of uncertainty that our clients are dealing with. And then what you have seen, though, is on the expense side that we have good rigor where the expense ex-FX and litigation is flat. And so you are offsetting those inflationary pressures by the good rigor that we are seeing and this is while continuing to be on the offense in terms of our FA recruitment and organic growth.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Okay. So the inflationary pressure, that sounds quite high to be managed down.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"That's right it's being managed by the offset. And we've done some actions which I've mentioned which in total are helping us more on the forward quarter than in the current quarter and also affecting the quarter and are still included in our cost being flat. So, really a good performance.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Thank you.,25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,Exane,"Morning. Thank you and welcome back to Sergio from me as well. I just want to pick up on a couple of topics that you've touched on already. Firstly, you talked about the Swiss banks combined market share. I wanted to clarify, is your plan to fully integrate the two networks under a single brand, single product range, single network, back office, head office? And then secondly, you also touched on the risk shelter. If I read the documents, it seems narrowly defined so that it won't cover things like litigation, restructuring, or indeed the operating costs of noncore, only asset disposal losses. So, it seems relatively unlikely to be drawn. So, I just wanted to ask, is it your base case that you will draw on that risk shelter or that you also agree it's unlikely that you will draw on that risk shelter.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Jeremy. Look, you know, the base plan that we announced on day one when we announced the transaction was, of course, the full integration. But we reiterated afterwards, and I said it also before that we are now evaluating what is the best option for the combined businesses going forward. I personally and we believe also that there is no – there is no real issue in terms of oversized presence in Switzerland or market share topics. I mean, for the reason I mentioned before, we may have to balance what is the best things to do from a shareholder standpoint of view with other aspects. We will take, in serious consideration, what is the best interest of clients? What is the best interest of employees and overall for society? Having said that, what we need to do is also to make those decisions based on facts and not emotions. Right now, the discussion is totally based on emotions. In many cases, totally uninformed. And we need ourselves to understand better those issues before we come to a conclusion. And it's very important not to jump into any conclusion. Whatever we do has to be sustainable and viable. And therefore, it takes a little bit of time, but it won't take forever. We know that both employees, clients and, in general, you as well, you want to have and we want to have as quickly as possible clarity on what to do. So be patient and in the next few months we will create more clarity on the matter. In terms of risks, of course, you're right. I mean, first of all, we have to realize that any losses that are coming outside the non-core units are part – will be absorbed by UBS. So, the only item that is subject to the guarantee is the non-core unit and the first 5 billion of losses coming from that unit is on UBS. So, we have almost by default an interest to be prudent in the way we mark this position, and sustainable in the way we look at how we disposed those positions. But at the same time, we are also the ones, you know, that want to preserve value for our shareholders. So, we will avoid – we will try to avoid at any cost having to tap into the guarantees. But at this stage, it's premature to discuss if we have to do it, when we have to do it. This is also a matter that needs to be closed as quickly as possible in terms of creating clarity. So, the next couple of months there will also be very important for us to fully understand the exposures and I'm convinced that this can be done in the timeframe that I just outlined.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,Exane,"Great, thank you very much. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first is just about the mechanics as you pay with the treasury shares if there's a difference versus, yeah, new share issuance just, yeah, conceptually and in terms of the impact. And then secondly, just a different question on your commercial real estate exposure. Can you give us a bit more detail on the regional mix, potentially maturity profile, LTV and so on? Thank you very much.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So on the treasury share, what happened is we actually repurchased some of the shares and they are available. They could have been cancelled and what we're doing is we are using them for the purpose of this acquisition. So, we are not issuing any new shares. And so in terms of commercial real estate, we have a very conservative portfolio that is – that has exposure to Switzerland in particular. But – and all of that is according to what you see from us, it was the high collateralization that you would expect. And when we give you all of our levels of reserves, we certainly reflect on the very high quality of those portfolio. Anke Reingen, RBC Okay. Thank you. Amit Goel, Barclays Hi. Thank you and welcome back, Sergio, too from me. So, two questions. The first, again, just on the transaction and the announcement on – on day one, I just wanted to check in terms of the cost savings and the timeline for EPS accretion whether or not your conviction levels have changed based on the information that you have had or seen since then. And then secondly, I was a bit surprised by the amount of, I guess, deposit outflow on a reported basis for GWM in the quarter. Do you mind just going through that just going through that in a bit more detail? You know, because obviously that's net of the inflows that we're seeing towards the end of the quarter. So, I appreciate there was a bit of a shift in mix and so forth. But if you could give a bit more color, that would be helpful. Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,," Sure. So, in terms of the cost savings and EPS, the assumptions that we gave you stand. And what is important is for the EPS accretion to remember that we gave you what were the reported numbers. So, we are not excluding non-core, we're not excluding restructuring charge. And given that we're dealing with non- core assets that could have a timeline, it could be that some of that comes over time, which is why we gave ourselves until 2027. Certainly the core EPS question in our models was faster than that. And then in terms of the deposit outflows for GWM, it is really very much the client repositioning that you are seeing at the beginning of the year. And so, people came in and even with our advisors actually really looked at their portfolios and especially in the U.S. and you've seen that phenomenon, as I mentioned, our deposit sequential decrease is exactly the same one as the Fed data. And as a result of people really looking at the difference in particular between what you can have on an after tax basis, between the Treasury bonds or money markets versus any savings products. So, our products are very attractive, but nevertheless, the Treasury bonds and money markets end up being more attractive. And therefore there have been mix shifts that are very, very logical for that type of clientele. And it is absolutely the right advice for clients that is really the majority of the driver and then it's offset by the inflows that we have gotten since we were a port in the storm during the period of March after things became a bit more difficult for others. Amit Goel, Barclays Okay. Thanks. And just on the cost savings, is that kind of, I guess, conditional on what the outcome is for the Swiss business? And is the conviction still there on the greater than 8 billion?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"So, the 8 billion-dollars-plus was done based on the base case and, of course, anything beyond that would be done in the context of what Sergio said and value creation. Amit Goel, Barclays Okay. Thank you. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first is you reiterated the 25% of the new group going forward with the investment bank, but if I combined UBS and Credit Suisse as of Q1, I am already at that number before fully transferring the current products and so on? So, does it mean you're already happy with the perimeter of the group and potentially happy to diversify your fixed income business via their credit sales and trading? Or is this number ultimately going lower towards maybe 20% or whatever the number is? And then, secondly, wondering about global wealth management. Do you re-underwrite the Credit Suisse client from a risk perspective? i.e. is there a new onboarding process or do they just join as of…the deal completing? Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio Ermotti,,"Well, on the 25%, I mean, it depends how you make the calculation. But you know directionally, what we are saying is that the 25% on a normalized basis will be the maximum. And from there onwards, we will look into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of…, going forward. And most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part of our offering. The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may have different views on certain client segments or people. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Understood. Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallet,KBW,"Good morning, everyone. So, just a couple for me. So, I mean first of all, how concerned are you around the revenue attrition already taking place at Credit Suisse? You know I guess where I'm coming from is based on the current revenue trajectory, the 8 billion of cost reductions might not actually be enough. So, could we be in a situation where a deeper restructuring is required. And then maybe secondly, around buybacks. I mean, part of the issue there is people are trying to time it and obviously, work out the capital and so forth. I suppose that you got one side, you got the government guarantees and then on the other, you've got a very politically sensitive situation. And I suppose regardless of your capital position, is it fair to assume that buybacks are very much kind of at the back of mind for now and we're talking 18 plus months away before you can even consider that between the link between obviously your strong capital position – expected capital position and the government guarantees. Thanks.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Tom. Now, look, of course, the revenue attrition is a function of what happened in the last couple of months. And also, if you look at the – the profitability is highly impacted by the cost of funding they had experienced in the last few months. I think that once things are together and normalized, we will also create some tailwinds in respect of lower cost of funding and an ability to re-attract clients. I'm convinced that a lot of the clients will see the value added of the combined businesses and some of those flows will revert. So, of course, we are at the same time, not complacent. So, if we see that this is not enough, we will need to take actions. And, of course, we want to, at the very least, bring back the profitability ambitions that we had as a UBS standalone with one of the combined entities. So, cost – focus on efficiency on costs and capital returns and value creation is part of the equation, and we will do the necessary steps to do that. Look, in terms of buyback, it's way too premature to talk about it. You know, assuming that it takes 18 months for clarity, it's a guess that I – you know, I fully understand your point, but believe me, we don't know yet ourselves. So – but we will give you clarity as soon as we have clarity on this matter. We need to be sensitive to many aspects. But I'm also convinced that it won't take quarters or years to create that clarity. So, the trajectory of freeing up resources, of creating clarity around the guarantees, creating clarity around the business model and our capacity to combine, you know, a dividend policy that sees a constant improvement in the cash we pay out combined with share buyback is an important element of our equity story, and we will be very focused on that in our communication.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallet,KBW," Great. Thanks, Sergio.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Nicholas Payen,Kepler Cheuvreux,"Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Nicolas. No. To be honest, it felt [like] I never left. So I think that you don't see any meaningful change. Of course, some things, like is normal, they should change. They should have changed. Not everything I left was perfect, so things needed to be addressed. And other things are very personal and then very – a question of style. But, I mean, the strength of the franchise was only reinforced over the last two years and this is the reason why we were able to be part of the solution over the weekend, so – which is a huge achievement for UBS. Even if – when you go back into where we were during the financial crisis, in my point of view, this was the ultimate payback to Switzerland. The fact that UBS was part of the solution was the ultimate payback on what the government had to do. And we were always very thankful for that. And so, in that sense, nothing has changed, if anything has been reinforced. And Sarah?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"On GWM, you actually have a technicality, which is that we put in our FA’s at both the very high end of FA’s, but also the people that are in that client advice center, and so it came really mostly from the client advice center. And so really focusing on the flows and the productivity of the FA’s is where we are and we are not seeing an issue here. In fact, you have seen the very good flows that we have experienced in the U.S. this quarter.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Nicholas Payen,,Thank you.,25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale,"Hi. Good morning. And welcome back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the more integrated disclosure on the beta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly from the U.S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some color on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024. And then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the perimeter of what mean – of what goes into non-core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few years now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS lumps with IBD. I guess the question is how do you see that business within your IB structure?",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take the second question. I think that, yes, the DNA won't change what we do is part of the equation and having a diversified portfolio of businesses does include also having leverage finance. Of course, we are – we will stay very focused on how we are present in that business. We want to be meaningful to our clients, but also to be mindful that you know, this cannot be the driver of the profitability of the investment bank with all associated, you know, volatility and risks. So, you can count on us, or our clients can count on us being a relevant player, but definitely, we are not – our ambition is not to be at the top of the league just for – and to make it a central part of our model. So, expect at the margins a little bit more, but in a very, very focused way. And we will also look at ways to be creative around that business, because there are opportunities for us to also partner with other institutions on how to manage, you know residual risk. So, our ability has to be to be the bridge in the investment bank between different sources of capital and not necessarily originate and store risks.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sarah Youngwood,,"In terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, first of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or below the modelled beta. But then what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which are yielding those higher overall, on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we are in the cycle. So in the U.S. where those very high rates where we are at very high incremental betas. And that's continuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in Europe, we went from being really at fairly low levels to – now moving into a place where there is price sensitivity, especially for GWM clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit of mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix shift there. And then on – in Switzerland, you've got a mix where you've got the P&C, especially in Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of Switzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have – or are still in that place in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shift or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, going into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024, really, it will depend on the rate path. Sergio P. Ermotti – closing remarks Okay. Looks like there are no more questions. Thank you for being with us this morning. As I said, despite the very uncertain market conditions, we delivered solid underlying results for the quarter. We have been maintaining our capital and liquidity positions, and we were also able to get very close to resolve a legacy matter that has been with us for 15 years. We discussed also the unique opportunity that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents not only for our shareholders, but I believe also for all the rest of our stakeholders, employees, clients, society at large. And of course, this is not going to be a straight line journey. You know, it's going to be a challenging one, is a complex one. But I do believe that, you know, the benefits outweigh by far, all those factors. So, I know that you are looking for more details. We are also you are looking for more details. And we will really do our best to keep the communication channels open over the next few weeks and months so that we can provide the necessary information to have a better understanding of this great equity story ahead of us. Thank you. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. The Russia–Ukraine war has led to heightened volatility across global markets, exacerbated global inflation, and slowed global growth. In addition, the war has caused significant population displacement, and if the conflict continues or escalates, the scale of disruption will increase and continue to cause shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity, and may lead to recessions in OECD economies. The coordinated sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the war will widen and intensify, may have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. In addition, turmoil in the banking industry has increased and, at the urging of Swiss authorities, UBS has announced historic plans to merge with another global systemically important bank in Switzerland. The transaction creates considerable integration risk. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the ongoing execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and labor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from nation states; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities currently existing in the Credit Suisse group (which is expected to become part of UBS), the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consumption of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including UBS’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.",25 April 2023,1Q23,1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. A billion dollar beat in the quarter. I never did quite get the hang of forecasting lark. Just on that then -- so non-core, very strong performance and appreciate the updated runoff profile you give us on slide 6. Is there any reason that you're just reverting to natural runoff or can we expect continued sales if markets stay favorable because clearly there's quite a meaningful driver of the very favorable capital ratio and the interactions of all of those. And then secondly, the project to improve the revenue to risk-weighted assets in wealth management, are presumably, you wouldn't represent the Q1 performances kind of the payoff of that project is? It's too early but just what's the profile of that project? How long is that repricing sitting on the net new asset generation and has it started? Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Alastair, before I pass to Todd, I wanted to -- you were the first to ask the question not by coincidence since I understand it's your last day at the office, so.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yes, yes. Thank you, Sergio.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Well, enjoy -- enjoy your time off going forward. So, I'll pass it over to Todd. Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Alastair. Thanks for the questions. So on NCL, I mean first reverting to natural runoff. I mean, we've been consistent in just reflecting the natural runoff profile. What I think the slide 6 really does indicate is, it really narrows that, that delta between where we started, you know, as you can see where we set our ambition is to reduce to 5% and, you know, that the natural runoff profile has really come in. You see that the delta between the natural runoff profile and where we, our ambition is narrowed. So that should, eliminate whatever uncertainty was considered, but I do think that it's appropriate still to reflect it that way in terms of, you know, whether we can do more of course we're going to continue to do what we can. We'll try to position -- we'll try to exit positions, at or above their, their book values wherever possible. But, you know, it's appropriate to continue to stick with our guidance on NCL, in terms of, you know, our approach, and in terms of our expectations around revenues. On GWM in terms of revenue over the RWA, I mentioned that we're starting to see progress, which of course does suggest you asked, has it started and it has. In fact, it started at the end of last year and the business is quite active in it. And, and so, we would expect that we're going to continue to make progress on driving up RWA efficiency with respect to revenues in that respect over the course of the next couple of years. You asked how long that will impact. How long will it go? How long will it impact net new assets? We said, it's going to take the better part of two years which is why we guided net new assets of around 200 billion over that two-year timeframe. And we think that's the appropriate guidance still.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Okay. Thank you. And Sergio, thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,, Sure. Pleasure.,7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yeah. So two for me, by the end of the year, I guess, you'll be effectively halfway through the integration process in terms of gross savings. So as you get through that process, are you starting to get a better picture of what you could expect for the net savings figure in relation to the 13 billion? Todd, I think you mentioned the majority earlier. And does that change at all the phasing of the multi-year return on core tier 1 path you laid out the full year? And then second question. Sergio, you referenced earlier that insufficient capital didn't cause the collapse of CS and I guess, in the final instance, what we really saw was a crisis in client confidence that drove that liquidity shortfall. So when we talk about capital distribution, it's sort of automatic to assume that higher or earlier capital distribution, results in lower capital ratios, which in turn, reduces resilience. But when you talk to clients, how important is that distribution ambition as an indicator and driver of confidence in the business i.e,. like could you argue that ultimately aligning your distribution strategy more closely with the distribution policies we see elsewhere in European financials, actually increases client confidence in the business and improves resilience. There's a big perception difference basically between the firm that’s buying back stock versus a firm that’s issuing stock?",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,,7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Yeah. Hey Chris,"I’ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better","view on the net that we’ll get to. Look, you know I think we're quite pleased with that 1Q operating expense performance. We did highlight that we expect gross saves to be halfway to our 13 billion ambitions at the end of the year which is a bit better than we highlighted in February in large part because of the 1Q performance that we saw. But look, we still -- our ambition is a cost-to-income ratio of less than 70% at the end of 2026. That's what we're really focused on to manage to and so how we pace any investments, which we'll continue to make in, for example, the resilience of our infrastructure, the organic growth in our core businesses, how we pace that will be a function of the revenue environment. So it is still -- it is still way too early to change that perspective. But of course, we are pleased with the opex performance we saw in 1Q. As to how that impacts on the return on CET1 path that you mentioned, I would say that coupled with the updated NCL full-year PBT guidance I gave, would have roughly 100 to - slightly above basis point impact on the return on CET1, but I would still say mid single-digits is the right way to think about the full year ROCET1, even with the 1Q performance that we produced.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yes, Chris, first of all, of course, you know, having a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all seasons, as we call it, having a strict risk management approach and policies and being very disciplined in a way we consume and manage all our resources is the pillar number one of our strategy. And I think it's almost a prerequisite to create the trust that clients need to have in any bank or any organization. So in that sense, I would only add that another very important indicator, which sometimes is in conflict with clients is your funding cost. Of course, our clients would like to have always a higher returns on the deposits and the investment they place with us. But on the other hand, when they see our funding cost being as competitive as we have now, they have the ultimate confirmation of the strength and the solidity of our franchise. So ultimately, at the end of the day, it's always a trade-off between different dynamics by, I would say, emotional and psychological dynamics. But I can only tell you that, of course, last but not least, having a full alignment of client trust and satisfaction, having shareholders being happy, and having your employees being happy is the ultimate way to create sustainable value and trust in any bank. And this is our philosophy. So of course, having an ability to compete in terms of growth and our global ambitions, but at the same time, being able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders, it's very important to influence the three stakeholders I mentioned.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative. Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you. Yeah, very good question. Yeah, I think that -- let me put it that way that some of the conditions that were discussed and agreed at over that weekend that were clearly, defined and communicated for example, the one in respect of the antitrust and the competitive nature in our local markets that has been very well defined and agreed. Others, I would say, were also discussed and agreed. Let me put it that way. I'm not so sure we can talk about a MAC clause but as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are delivering on our commitments. So I probably stop here. And in respect of the amount of capital and I think it's clearly too early to speculate or respond to speculations around the capital. I just want to underline that when we talk about our parent company, you know, UBS had already up for -- one of the best in class capitalization, the quality of our capital in the parent company was very strong. What I mentioned that is already embedded in our plan. We are absorbing USD 9 billion of concession granted to Credit Suisse. We are absorbing the progressive buffers that will come in as a consequence of market share and size. And we believe this is feasible and is part of the plan. So, before we speculate about what we would do to respond to any other changes in regulatory requirements, we need to understand what they are, because, believe me, we have not been consulted. We don't know what they are. And so, we need to have the full picture before we respond to this kind of situations. But let me just say that having a global franchise, being competitive globally, is what makes us a very attractive bank to our clients. Shrinking back to greatness is not a strategy and is not what will serve, not only our clients and our shareholders well, but I'm also convinced is not going to serve well, Switzerland and its ambitions to be one of the leading financial center in the world. That's pretty clear to me. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Aurora Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital proposal again. And you said, you were not consulted on this document and you need to see what the final proposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you now part of the discussion, do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question. And then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fees better than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what should we expect there? Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"I pick up the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if we're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and so that we can contribute to fact-based discussions. And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight some of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based discussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible date because the commission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that..",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"June 2025 I meant, sorry.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"That one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity about this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. So in the meantime, we have to accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, hi Giulia, on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- how one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the environment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows – and 1Q was, but I would really highlight that it wasn’t so much just beta. But actually, it’s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it’s an environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in more complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and then also, I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say it gives us confidence as we look out forward. One is that the align product shelf, so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've approached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the playbook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also paying off. So we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to be conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned and really allows us to drive transactional flows higher.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Thanks.,7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas Exane,"Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, please. One is, you talked about the Investment Bank and the core businesses that you've retained from Credit Suisse and the people you've brought over. I just wanted to – are they now fully productive in revenue terms? Or is there some lag still to come through, as those people ramp up? Are they up to speed already at this point? And then my second question is sort of, again, on the capital theme. I saw in the report, you reiterate your intention to do the 1 billion of buybacks in the second half of this year. I guess, that's a small enough amount that you can do it pretty much regardless of the new capital proposals. But I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Well, let me take the first question is very – you know, of course everybody is now up and running and productive. And – but when you look at Banking, as you know, what does it mean being productive? It does, you know, there is a phase of going out and pitching and winning mandates and then it takes time until they get executed. So, in a sense if you are asking me if they are productive in pitching and being engaged with clients, they are. Everybody is full speed. The momentum in winning mandates is great. You could see it in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we have executed many of them. And we are very comfortable that the investments and the trajectory of growth that we see going forward, if market conditions stay there to allow the execution of those mandates, are very promising. In respect of the billion, so I think that you know, at this stage, the only constraints we have right now is the waiting until the parent bank merger is executed. We expect this to be in at the end of May and if everything goes through successfully, pending the regulatory approvals that we need, we intend to restart the share buybacks with up to a billion dollars for 2024.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas Exane,"Very helpful, thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning. Two questions please, basic follow ups. Firstly on the Non-core result, obviously a tremendous result both in terms of the RWA run-down but also the gains that you've booked during the quarter. Thank you for the revised guidance for the full year. I just wanted to better understand the source of those gains in Q1, I think you said conduit and corporate loan books and longevity portfolio. You then don't expect that to repeat going forward. Is that because the low hanging fruit has already been achieved or because you're now selling a different type of asset, or anything you can elaborate there will be helpful. And then the second question, thank you for the opening remarks, Sergio. On the parent bank capital, I just wanted to check, the 9 billon you referenced, is that in relation to a 400% risk-weight on foreign subsidiaries, or is it the 300% as it currently is phased? And then more broadly, a question to the both of you, in the event that the risk weight on foreign subsidiaries does go up, to what extent do you think you can mitigate that through the fungibility of capital, dividend, trapped capital and so forth? Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Andrew. I'll address the first question. I mean, in terms of the source of the gains, I think as, you know, as you mentioned, and as of course I highlighted, it came from a number of the sort of sectors within NCL, Conduit, and Corporate Loans, Longevity, Securitized Products. We're also seeing, you know, strength in Credit and Equities and Macro as well. And, you know, the team has been doing a great job in unwinding these complex, longer dated transactions. And that continues to be what they're going to be focused on doing. So the source of the gains comes from, you know, the ability to add a lot of value to these complex transactions. And you know, to be able to get the transactions closed out at levels that are above book value. And as I highlighted, that's not an expectation that people should continue to have, not least just given that sometimes we're going to make decisions to get out of positions where we know there's significant cost takeout or there's suboptimal capital at the moment, it's very suboptimal from a capital efficiency perspective, and so getting out would release that. So they're going to be a number of factors that – which is why, you know, we don't see 1Q repeating.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So if I can add on that one, before I touch on the second question. I think that's the – first of all, there is definitely no low hanging fruit and if you look at our natural decay profile change, it shows you that we are not really going for easy to sell but rather complex transactions that also helps in many cases to unwind costs, because priority number one in Non-core is to take down cost, and not necessarily to take down risk weighted assets and market or credit risk weighted assets. So, in that sense, it's very important that in many cases we are able, thanks to the good work the team is doing in managing these unwinds, to leverage the fact that we are not a forced seller. We are only going to dispose assets when they create value to shareholders. And that's a – is a completely different position to be in because our capital is strong. We can allow some delays or some time to elapse between the two. Now on the 9 billion, so there are two factors actually; one is the 250% risk weightings and 400% for foreign companies and the elimination of the filter – of the regulatory filter that Credit Suisse had. The two combined account for 9 billion.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup," And the ability to mitigate any increase in the foreign subsidiaries going forward? Assume it’s something you're already working on given the already base increase, to what extent you think you could accelerate that.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"No the mitigation – look the mitigation I go back to is – I mean, I have to – it’s like replay, push the button again and replay what I told you or what I said before, we cannot speculate or respond to speculation or do analysis on things that we don't know. What we know is that we're going to hold, as a consequence of the Credit Suisse acquisition, 9 plus 10 billion, so almost 20 billion of additional capital on an already very strong capital position UBS had. That's the fact. The rest, I don't know and we will comment when we know more.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Brilliant, very clear. Thank you for that. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just – I'm sorry to follow up, just one thing. I mean, is it fair to say that a result of the uncertainty and not really changing any step in your strategy and execution of the merger and specifically, with Q4 results, you mentioned, the potential amortization of additional DTA, just confirming this – at the current stage, this is going ahead. And then on the net new assets, the 17 billion [edit: 27 billion] in Q1, that’d be running below, if I were thinking about $100 billion for this year – should it be rather than 100 billion this year, is it more like the 200 billion over the years – or two years – and more backend loaded towards the 2025 to reach the 200 billion? And has the decline in relationship managers had any impact on the net new assets growth in Q1? In the past, you gave us some numbers about departed relationship managers and the assets they have taken with them. Is that the case, as being relatively low? Thank you very much.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, I’ll take the first question. I think that, Anke, I think – this is a very complex integration, and we cannot afford to be distracted in the execution of it. So we are sticking to our strategy. We are sticking to our plan. We need to do that and at the same time, stay close to our clients. And so that's the reason why engaging in hypothetical change of strategy or methodology we use in assess our – anything that goes around capital – would be absolutely very distracting and not in the best interest of any stakeholders, because what we want to have is a successful completion of this integration. And so we stay focused on the existing strategy and our approach.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah Anke, on the second question, in terms of net new assets in GWM. I would just reiterate that the trajectory that we highlighted over the next two years is, among other things, a function of the financial resource optimization and balance sheet initiatives that the team is hard at work in undertaking. So 27 billion in the quarter is a strong result, we're on track to deliver on our ambitions, which we said was 200 billion over the course of two years. So I would continue to think about that in those terms. In terms of the RMs who have left, you mentioned that we had given some numbers in the past. Yeah, I mean, that has continued just to taper. As an impact, just given the number of RMs who have left, has become sort of a non-topic at this point in time. In terms of any current period, and in terms of the assets that they’ve taken with them, it is a very small percentage, ultimately, of the given – especially given the fact that the RM workforce in Credit Suisse is down 40% from the end of 2022 levels, and we've been able to retain the lion share of the assets. So, we consider that to be sort of a story not terribly worth following, and in the end, we stay focused on our plans and our commitments. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you. Can I just ask on the DTA please? Are you reiterating that we expect to convert that 2 billion and the 500 million you talked about with Q4 results?",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah. There's no change in terms of our approach to DTAs at the current time, Anke. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you very much. Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. One on your favorite topic, capital. Just conceptually, trying to understand, because when the press it’s reported, or the Minister of Finance speaks, about capital, and we naturally assume it’s CET1 capital, but do you think it could also partially include additional tier 1 capital, which might make it more manageable for you? And then secondly, on your Global Wealth Management net new loans in the quarter, another decline, it’s very similar to the Q4 decline. Just trying to reconcile that with your risk appetite returning statement – being conscious of the yield curve’s still not favorable but wondering if it's also more of a risk alignment still going on in the background, which is why your outstanding remains negative? Thank you very much.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don’t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it’s not – we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that – i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I’m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over – if, assuming they do – over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Understood. Thank you very much. Piers Brown, HSBC Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me, just coming back on the cost issue, and the costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive, you're down 26% quarter-on- quarter. And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction. Just, I mean, the question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in terms of frontloading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL? And then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in any of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be mindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey Piers. In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship, I would say. It's, it could be, the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly. And that's because, the cost takeout will often come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given infrastructure or application that we’re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the asset takeout and the cost takeout. I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out portions of a portfolio that still needs at least a large share of the headcount supporting that, whether it's the front office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio. And if you're not really able to decommission the associated technology, you may not get the saves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's something we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high-degree of correlation.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Now on the competitive position. Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that topic. Even if you go down to the substance, which is, I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or everybody to understand. When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in Switzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at branch – number of branches; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense. I think we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused with market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement and the facts support our position that our plan is the right one to pursue. Piers Brown, HSBC Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallett,KBW,"Hi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for this year in your guidance. If that was zero, what would that – or how would that alter your guidance? And then secondly, on the treatment of software intangibles, I suppose it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a benefit relative to your European peers. I mean, if you were to align the rules with Europe, what sort of impact would that have on your capital? Thank you.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory framework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms, but also vis-à-vis the European peers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital base.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Hey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar rate cuts. If there were fewer than those – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes, that would be corrected to be upside. If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or two on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client behavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that – likely to be some degree of upside, all other things equal.",7 May 2024,1Q24,1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Sarah Mackey,,"Thank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and Todd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors;

Jeremy Sigee,Exane BNP Paribas,"Good morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Yes. Thank you. It's Alastair, BofA. Sergio, good morning. Great to have clarity on the strategy and obviously the market is delighted as you are that the flows have come back. Just then on operating costs. Very clear ambitions and it looks like you're bringing forward a little 2027 to 2026 when you've landed everything. But just given the size of the operating costs in the old Credit Suisse investment bank and non-core, can you give us any sense about how quickly you can go there? So the quite a large restructuring charge, integration charge in the second half, but does that cost number move out quickly so that you normalize profitability or is there still quite a long, long tail to the cost in that part of the business? It's just, you know, IB classic, the revenues have gone, the costs are still lingering and how quickly they go? Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Alastair. Yeah. In terms of the speed at which we expect to take out cost. As Sergio and I said, we've been operating at pace in terms of the cost takeout which is among our top priorities. In terms of in particular restructuring the parts of Credit Suisse that need immediate attention and restructuring. And so you see how we're making very strong progress out of the gate in terms of the cost takeout through the second half of 2023 and the cost to achieve those cost takeout as well. We've obviously modeled to get to the targets that – or the landing zones that we described earlier in terms of returns and the cost-to-income ratio at the end of 2026. But as you say, the costs do have a long tail in some cases, and that's because of the complexity of the operation that we have to unpack. Because you have significant infrastructure and technology; you have a very large array of legal entities, over a thousand legal entities, that have to be addressed. And just back one proof point on the software components, there are 3,000 applications and the work that our team has done suggests that we will only integrate 300 into UBS. That takes time. And so, yes, there is a long tail, but you can count on us to operate quickly. The last thing I would say is in terms of clarity on a sense of as those things hit through, because we give a degree of clarity through the second half of the year and we give sort of that landing zone, we will come back with further clarity once we do the business planning process in the second half of the year.And that will be with our fourth quarter earnings in early February.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,," And I would probably complement Todd’s observation. Because, it is very important that de facto the vast majority of the assets are in non-core and legacy are supported by the Credit Suisse IB platform. So, as we progress in winding down the, call it, core day-to-day operation from the front office stand point of view. Whatever is left is going to be legacy infrastructure, IB infrastructure, that is only there for non-core. And so you can see out then this will be a very important element in determining how quickly we get rid of non-core assets. Because as a consequence of that, we accelerate the winding down of this operation. But I think that's exactly what we are working on and we will give you more detail early on next year when we present our Q4 results and our three year plan.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. First, in Wealth Management, you've talked about now essentially being at scale in every growth market globally. But in tangible terms, what does that enhanced scale enable you to do that perhaps you weren't able to do previously? And have you seen any proactive response from competitors in reaction to that enhanced scale? That's my first question. And then second, looking at the banking business in Switzerland. Now the dust has settled, does all the volatility we saw earlier in the year changed at all how you think strategically about running the combined Swiss bank be it in terms of capital, funding, liquidity, etc.? I guess just sort of simply has your risk appetite changed in Switzerland?",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you. So, , look, in terms of scale, of course, there is an economy of scale. So, being able to leverage UBS's IT platform as we onboard all the assets. It's a huge advantage because we have, call it, marginal costs effects. But also when you look at the geographic footprint of the two operations, they are extremely complementary in some areas by relationships, but also in geographical terms, i.e. for example, in Brazil, right. So, we had a we had a lot of operation, Credit Suisse is much stronger, we now create a very important player. In Asia we've really reinforced our position and both in North Asia and Southeast Asia. I think that in Switzerland its quite clear, And also across Europe where there are different markets where you know ideally it's a very fragmented market in general, wealth management, particularly in Europe. So there, we create economies of scales and things that we would have not been able to fund from our organic standpoint of view. So, it's very important. As I mentioned before also Credit Suisse across the board, in asset management, in wealth management brings capabilities and excellent products that can be then leveraged into our, into the UBS client franchise. And we've seen the competitors. I mean the reaction of competitors, of course, they started to take advantage of the fragile situation of Credit Suisse already during 2022, late 2022, of course, at the beginning of the year. And it's a pretty normal situation so. Now having said that, I think that as you saw from the flows, clients are now comfortable and they understand the value added of the franchise, we are able to retain and actually re-attract back clients. So, now it's our turn to be proactive and we will not spare any effort to regain back any lost assets. So, in terms of the Swiss has anything, is anything changing? I mean, it's very important to reiterate that nothing changes in the way we run our Swiss businesses until they are fully integrated, right? So, from a client point of view, and in service, and in risk, and capital allocation, nothing changes. And even after we merged, our commitment, as I said in my remarks, is that we will continue to sustain the combined lending book. Of course, there are exceptional risky situations, but our principle is very clear. One and one makes two. We want to keep our market share in Switzerland. Switzerland is strategic, absolutely strategic for the Group, and we will not want to lose any of the market share we have today. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yeah, good morning, Sergio and Todd. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on risk weighted assets. You have around USD 557 billion, USD 145 billion operational risk weighted assets. And I'm just wondering how we should think about the exit run rates in 2026 in terms of total risk weighted assets as well as in terms of operational risk weighted assets if I may. And then the second question is related to the non- core. Could you talk a little bit about the P&L effects of the non-core ex any more active write-downs or sales, so to say, leading to potential write-downs? I'm just trying to understand the P&L in terms of run rate of the noncore legacy bank, if I may. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi Kian. In terms of the op risk RWA, we will come back next quarter after doing a fair bit of additional modeling in terms of the op risk RWA of the combined bank. We've started to have initial views on that and initial discussions with our regulators and that informed the 10 billion reduction that I spoke about in my comments. And then, in terms of the trajectory and how we think about the 5.57 towards 2026, you'll have more color on that after we complete the business planning process and our 3 YSP and come back early next year as mentioned. In terms of, you asked about the P&L and the run rate in non-core. So, what I would say on that is. So first off, the thing that's most important is to take costs out and to focus very significantly on the cost takeout because there's a significant level of overhead and costs that aren't associated with the wind down of the portfolio. So, the way to think about it is that we have emphasized so far today that we have to take costs out and effectively, the costs that sit in parts of Credit Suisse that don't work. And so, those costs, whether they be personnel costs or whether they be technology costs or real estate costs, they move into non-core and legacy if they don't support the core businesses and they have to be run down extremely quickly. And so, I would say, first and foremost, it's a cost. The way to think about it is the cost rundown over the integration timeline. Then there's the asset rundown and we talked about the trajectory from a natural rundown perspective. And of course as Sergio mentioned that there will be strategically and actively looking at that. And of course from that perspective, we have taken some PPA adjustments in excess of USD 5 billion relating to non-core and legacy. I think that's a useful way to think about it too, the fact that some of that pulls to par and some of that will be fair value positions. And we will manage that book in the most capital efficient way that we can and dispose of positions as appropriate. And also keeping just considering funding costs and the costs of operations, technology, people, etc. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Okay. Thank you. If I may just very briefly on the risk weighted assets, if I – to take a very simplistic view and I just assume. I know the runoff, I can make some assumptions about Basel IV then op risk which is clearly very difficult to predict if I want to be conservative. One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets conservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline?",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Kian, its, you know, we can't really comment right now. We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because: one, there are two elements – well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,"Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to go back actually to some of the elements you have discussed on this call already, especially the NCL. Maybe trying to help us understand how much of the ROCET1 improvement towards 2026 is going to be driven by this unit, considering our move to natural runoff here, you know, trying to help us assess already at this stage what – how loss-making it is today and how loss- making it would end up being in 2026, only considering the natural runoff. And then the other question I wanted to raise is on the cost save. Just to make sure I understand correctly. So you basically have already a target of 3 billion cost saves on an annualized run rate at the end of this year. But this is compared to the end of 2022, I think. So, how much of the annualized 3 billion do you kind of already have, you know, in the 2Q accounts, please? Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Flora. So, in terms of, I'll take, maybe address the second point first. In terms of the cost saves in the – in terms of what we're projecting by the end of the year at 3 billion. In terms of what we see already in the second quarter, we haven't disclosed that specific number. But I think from just the head count reductions that I mentioned in my remarks, you could probably consider that there's somewhere more than, around half has already started to hit through, and what we're already seeing in our underlying results. In terms of our CET1 and how to think about NCL as we go through the process. For sure, NCL is, you know, is going to be something that weighs down on our CET1 naturally Just given the fact that, you know, we have significant, at least over the 2024 to 2026 period. If you just look at the natural profile rundown, which is effectively basis for how we started thinking about the RoCET,1 not the only way we started to model it, but, for sure, one of the ways that we were thinking about it. There's a drag by definition in the sense that, by the end of 2026, you could see in the slide the natural profile has roughly half going away. Now, we can model different scenarios as can you, but we're not going to discuss how we're thinking about it and obviously, some of that is still very much unknown. In terms of the cost takeout, we would expect to be taking out the lion's share of the costs in non-core and legacy by the time the integration is materially complete, by definition. We will do that. There’ll be, we expect some residual carry that we'll have to take on or continue to run down beyond 2026. So, there is some, if you will, negative burn that is associated with NCL in our modeling.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about: a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on revenue cost synergies. I mean, you had a comment and especially if you think you can keep this with market share unchanged. Is it something you really think maybe people get overly concerned and you don't see quite that risk of a revenue dissynergies even if you potentially have to contract some of this at bit more attractive rates or incentivizing your advisors? And then secondly, on slide 16 where you show us the return path and there's this block about the funding cost efficiencies. And that's something you – I guess apart from the drop out of the higher expense funding at Credit Suisse, is there other areas where you see the material benefits from lowering funding costs and overall group benefits because this block is the same size as the cost base rightsizing? Obviously can maybe elaborate a bit more on that area. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Let me take the first question. First of all, I haven't said that we will keep our market share. I said that our ambition is to keep the market share. Now, having said that, Credit Suisse lost their market share and business in the last 12 months or so. So, what we count on is the fact that, you know, we will be able to recapture and regain some of the market share and what you saw lately in the last couple of months is a good sign of that. But, of course, we are not, we are realistic and we are also factoring in that we may lose market shares because some clients may or may not feel, you know, that they want a certain concentration of risk. So, you know, there is no danger of us budgeting or planning blue-sky scenarios on that one. We are realistic, but that should not be confused with our desire to keep as much as we can.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Anke, on the second, –the second question in terms of material benefits, we see you obviously highlighted the most significant one, which will be just the take out of the significant cost that we were wearing in connection with the PLB and the ELA+ facilities. But, I would say, and, as I've remarked earlier, that we expect the positive contribution from the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise in our NII in 3Q and that comes principally from having stabilized the business and net new deposits that are also helping on NII. So, I would say that's another factor that is helping on the underlying profitability.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from my side. The first, to play devil's advocate, are there more outflows to come or where you kind of already had outflows from clients, but maybe some longer-term structures, partnerships or anything like that take time to see the outflows? And then secondly, for the first time in a while, your CET1 capital is higher than your tangible book value or almost the same. So now, the 15% return on CET1, should that also be broadly similar to RoTE, going forward, or should we expect more moving parts towards 2026? Thank you very much.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you. Let me take the first questions. I guess, as I mentioned before, now, we are under wealth management broader perimeter. I think that, of course, we may still have client advisors that resigned over the last three or four months or that, as they move into a new organization, they may be able to bring some assets with them. What we see right now is clear that the ability of the people that left a while ago to really move assets is fairly limited. And this is nothing new compared to what UBS went through 10 years ago or more than 10 years ago in recognizing that there is a lot of institutional loyalty of the client base. And now that we have stabilized the franchises, of course, we are even stronger in retaining assets. And as I mentioned before, our desires to re-bring back assets. So, look, the movement, the gross movements are going to be very difficult to predict, but the net outcome we feel pretty comfortable will be positive.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Benjamin, in terms of the return on CET1 versus RoTE impact, I'd say there are two factors that do argue in favor of moving in that direction, just not yet but for sure on the first one, the denominator effect we’re bigger and so that's obviously going to make the difference between the historic RoTE versus RoCET1 smaller, by definition. So – and you know that – so that denominator effect is now in play and it is helpful as you suggest probably as well, contributing to what you observe. The other one though which has been our historic delta that really has given us pause to move off of what we think is a more meaningful return measure are DTAs. But there of course, you know, as they amortize down, because these generally although not exclusively but generally relate to you know very old losses that we're you know now you know continuing to just chip away at as that balance comes down, then that's yet another factor that would argue in favor of moving to the other measure.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Well, by the way, for the foreseeable future and from a the other angle of measuring our capital return flexibility, the CET1 ratio is a better proxy because this is the true binding constraint.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Fair enough and very clear. Thank you. Amit Goel, Barclays Hi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time trying to update estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate, are you able to give any color in terms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you’d like it to trend? And then secondly, just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of curious things like, you know, 10 billion gross, but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that do you expect to do where you found the incremental 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also, how you're spending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. So, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Hey Amit. So, as mentioned in terms of color, further color on the trajectory as to we get end of 2023 to end of 2026, we'll come back on that to provide an update in 3Q as to where we are. But then, you know, a much more fulsome perspective after our business planning processes is complete by the end of the year into early next year. In terms of the cost savings, you know, Sergio also made, remarked in his comments. The gross number is greater than 10 billion as you highlight. But we will be making investments. We're going to grow our business. We're going to invest in technology. We're going to, you know, also deal with inflationary factors if need be. So, you know, that's all in the thinking around it, around half of the gross cost saves relate to effectively restructuring the Credit Suisse IB and CRU units. And the other half gross relates to the synergies we expect to realize, but then that will be – they'll be investments back into the technology and the people to grow the core franchises.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale,"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the detail. So, firstly, on the fair value markdowns that you've taken there, related to that, could you give an idea of the maturity remaining on these financial assets and how we should think about the reversal of those markdowns? So, you've highlighted more than 1.5 billion for the second half of this year. Is that the kind of run rate that we should be expecting going forward? And then secondly, on the NCL, perhaps I can ask it a different way. Do you have a better idea now of what the ultimate cumulative losses might be from the NCL? Would they be less than the 5 billion maybe that you might have been exposed to under the LPA agreement? That's my question there. And then thirdly, might I quickly ask, on the domestic side, certainly for some businesses, you will have a significant market share. And I wonder if there's any maybe regulatory risk that that market share might be looked at and you'd be forced to bring it down to a level which is more palatable to the regulators. Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah. Because you asked three questions instead of two, I'll take the last one. On the market share one, as you know, we got regulatory approvals to basically not be subject to any competitive constraints, and that was done just to secure and be able to communicate and to be able to place. Although it was already crystal clear as it is today that there is no market share topics for the combined unit in Switzerland. I mean if you go across the board, cantonal banks are larger on any dimensions of relevant personal and commercial banking business in Switzerland. And when you measure in terms of branches, we are combined the third largest player. So, now this is very relevant but because some people may argue, well, these cantonal banks are combined versus you being one unit. Well, the fact, the truth of the matter is that we compete in those cantons with the local cantonal banks. It's extremely relevant to make that difference. Therefore we will, of course, contribute what the competitive authorities have to say about it and put our views into it. But I don't really expect that on a fact based discussions we will be subject to any limitation or meaningful limitations in respect of our activities going forward. Andrew let me just unpack your first and second, I think they're related. So, on the first, you know as we highlighted earlier, we took around 15 billion of fair value marks on financial assets and liabilities, 12.5 billion where we indicated would pull to par because they relate to accrual accounted positions and another roughly 2.5 billion relate to fair value positions where we had further markdown in light of liquidity model risk other type issues. On the piece that pulls to par, just keep in mind that 4 billion of that 12.5 relates to non-core and legacy. So that's important to know and about 8.5 billion more in our core businesses. On the core business piece, generally speaking, we see three to four years that we should unwind between 70% and 80%. There will be a longer tail especially on some fixed rate loans that will go longer than that. So, we'll see pull-to-par effects that extend beyond the three- to four-year timeframe. But most of it will accrete to income over the shorter timeframe, as I mentioned. To the NCL point though, since we have roughly 4 billion of the pull-to-par in NCL and roughly 2 billion in the fair value marks, so you have 5 to 6 billion of fair value adjustments in NCL. And I think, to go to your second question, that's important to understand just given that we think that the positions are appropriately marked. And from here, we will continue to consider all our optionality in terms of running down the portfolio, as Sergio mentioned earlier, in a most capital and cost efficient way. But we think the positions are being carried at appropriate levels presently.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale,That's great. That's really helpful. Thanks.,31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Morning. Thank you for the questions. I want to get under the hood a little bit more in Wealth Management. Firstly, on the CS business acquired, clearly there are some business exits to worry about some that you think non-core in the kind of the wealth management unit. Can you give us a sense of what the revenue attached to that might look like. But also any detail on AT1 cost savings that come through the NII in that division as well. And then secondly, the competitive environment. I noticed in your GWM business, UBS standalone costs are up on lower revenues. I just want to know kind of what the cost is to retain management at this point? What are you seeing the competitive landscape on the RM side or the advisors side, but also in your deposit side what sort of campaigns have you been running to re-attract deposits and how easy or difficult has that been in the current rates and deposits environment? Thank you.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Adam. On the second one, would just say in terms of GWM costs. So, there's very significant positive operating leverage outside of the US, such important to note this is in the GWM – in the UBS subgroup GWM, very significant positive operating leverage. We were investing for growth in that business. But that business as well has been, you know, saw a strong NII performance and had strong PBT growth as I highlighted in my comments earlier. As I also highlighted, it's more on the GWM overall side, just the fact that we've seen a lot of cash sorting and rotation on NII in the Americas and that sort of pulled the Americas revenue down reasonably significantly. So, quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. And as a result, you know, we see that negative operating leverage, but we're continuing to invest in that business across the board and so some of that as well, contributes to the higher cost. On your deposit campaign question I would say that you know like any bank, we value deposits, we value deposits in the win-back context in wealth management. We also just value deposits to fund our business, loan growth, et cetera, so there's nothing I've seen that I would call out there in terms of deposit betas that have moved in a direction I would consider to be anything other than what we see across peers. In terms of the acquired – you were asking business exits and the revenue attached. At this point, we have in terms of what's being expected to move into non-core and legacy that was highlighted on one of the earlier revenues, in terms of what's moving across. And that's of course you know not risk-adjusted for – and so that, that needs to be considered. In terms of AT1 cost savings that hit through the business from what had been, say, anything there has really just been captured in the Credit Suisse Corporate Center as an offset potentially to the inflated cost so I would expect that that'll normalize now as you know as the businesses come together.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning it’s Andrew Coombs from Citi and thank you for taking my questions. Two if I may. Firstly, I want to turn back to follow up on the PPA pull-to-par bit in relationship to the restructuring charges. You made this comment that, out of the period at end of 2026, I think restructuring charges will be largely but not wholly offset by the PPA pull-to-par effect. And then in your later comments, you talked about probably 0.5 billion of pull-to- par effect, of which 4.5 would be noncore, and that most of that would be recognized in a three- to four-year timeframe. So, can we assume restructuring charges of the magnitude of 12.5? And can you give us a feel for the timing of those relative to the PPA pull-to-par? And then the second question is on slide 29. You provide a useful quarterly trajectory going from minus 0.3 billion in Q2 and you talked about breakeven in Q3. But you also flagged 750 million of savings, 550 million of funding cost savings. There's a 650 million arguably one-off ECL charge on the non-credit impaired CS portfolio data this quarter. So, just trying to understand the going from minus 0.3 billion to 0, even with all those additional benefits Q-on-Q, what's the offset? I guess there'd be some seasonality on revenue, a bit of a decline in NII. But any more color there?",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So, Andrew, in terms of – I’ll take the second point first – in terms of the story on the underlying profitability, yeah, I mean just be very clear that the cost saves that we expect to see by the end of 2023 of 3 billion, which we think you can price into 2024, some of that has been realized. But as I would – the way I would think about it is there is work that's ongoing and we expect that the greater than 3 billion number is something that we'll see at the end of the year hitting through. I would continue to reemphasize the funding cost point that was in 2Q that will benefit 3Q and fully in 4Q that helps. And then the stabilization as flows and all that will sort of hit through as we go on an underlying basis. And as I said, we expect to break even in the third quarter coming out of roughly a 300 million- plus improvement. And then to be positive in 4Q for the reasons that I mentioned. In terms of the restructuring you asked about, we'll come back in further details in terms of how much restructuring specifically there'll be. We're giving a perspective that we expect the number to be broadly offset by the pull-to-par effects. But at this point in time, we're going to need to detail that out in the business planning process and come back, as we have said, with our fourth quarter earnings.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,,Thank you.,31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Vishal Shah,Morgan Stanley,"Hi. Thank you so much for your questions. My first one is on wealth management. Just wanted to get a sense on you know how you are assessing you know the business overlaps in that segment – in that segment or you've had you know further chance to sort of you know look at you know different regions and how to respond to all the ongoing competitive pressures and in terms of you know relationship managers and then sort of bankers in that segment? So, if you could give a bit of an update on that side? And then the second one is on the investment bank, the CS non-core perimeter of 55 billion. I know in one of your slides have provided a natural run-off rate, but I was just trying to get a sense if you could provide any sort of color in terms of what is your sort of ambition on actively winding down this perimeter in terms of timeline, i.e. could we expect you know the next two years basically by 2025 you know broadly most of this run down to be done. Is that is that a fair assumption or are you looking at it in a bit of a different way? Thank you so much.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Vishal. I mean I think on this on that second question, we've addressed that in the sense that you know we offer the natural rundown just given you know of course, we have to take care and ensure that we're protecting our counterparties and we're doing things in the best interests of the firm and so on these positions that we, you know, we will look – we will look strategically to exit them as quickly as possible. But at this point, I would say, we'll come back and give you progress as we've done already in 2Q in terms of the actual RWA reduction relative to the natural runoff profile. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent we can give more color through our planning process, we will. But again, these are positions where we think, naturally, there'll be strategic exits and opportunities that arise and not something we'll, I will be disclosing. In terms of your first question on Wealth Management and assessing business overlaps, I mean, in general, the way we approach the integration is to look at Credit Suisse is adding value in a lot of the areas in which we already operate. But also, as Sergio mentioned, areas where we have less of a presence. Brazil was mentioned. There are important parts of the Middle East where that's the case; important parts of Southeast Asia. Also, much bigger in Europe overall. So, in terms of assessing the overlaps, I mean, in the end of the day, relationship managers have their client relationships and we want to retain them all. And of course, we're looking at how to manage the business in the most efficient and effective way. I would make one additional comment which is very important, which is that Iqbal had announced the area market heads on a combined basis, and that was very important just in the last several weeks and was in comments Sergio made as well, because when we start integrating how we approach the market and so we're in the market on an integrated basis, which, of course, just took time even though we move quickly in the two and a half months since we've closed, to be in the market on an integrated basis having market heads that have now been decided across wealth management on a combined and integrated basis is quite a step that helps us to manage some of the business overlaps and competitive pressures that you were asking about.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three to five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward- looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined bank; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and labor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of Credit Suisse, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of Credit Suisse, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities currently existing in the Credit Suisse Group, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.",31 August 2023,2Q23,2q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll ask two, please. So my first one, thank you very much for the guidance on NII in GWM which was something the market was looking forward to. Can I just ask a clarification? If you look at the current forward curve, when do you expect NII to bottom exactly? Do you think second half 2024 and then we can grow, or possibly first half of 2025? So that's the first question. And then the second question is, instead, on the capital of the parent and in particular the CSI, it seems to have a lot of excess capital and upstreaming that could reduce the impact of – the potential impact from the proposal in Switzerland. Can we expect UBS to upstream some of that capital or how are you thinking about excess capital at subsidiaries? Thank you.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So, regarding the NII guidance in terms of the implied forward curve. So as I mentioned, you know, we ended up pricing in, as you saw, and modeled for a 25 basis point rate cuts through the end of the year. If you look out in, in terms when the implied forward curve would suggest bottoming out, you know, we're probably pricing in more like 7 depending on what you're looking at. So, you know, I mean, from here, while difficult to speculate, it could be sometime in mid-2025, but I spent time what I think is really important to recognize is that, you know, in a lower NII – lower interest rate environment, there are significant offsets and tailwinds in the business that we expect to see. And that was a point that we wanted to really ensure is well understood because ultimately transaction revenues, re-leveraging and driving up NII from re-leveraging, and also recurring fees from mandate sales, you know, all have upside in an environment of lower interest rates. In terms of the parent bank capital, you mentioned our UK – Credit Suisse's UK subsidiary that has excess capital, of course, we're working on restructuring and on all of our subsidiaries where we can. And ultimately, you know, we will as appropriate upstream the capital in any of the subsidiaries in order to alleviate the capital at the parent bank.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Thank you.,14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Good morning. Let's just drill down to the areas where you've perhaps delivered ahead of expectations. So firstly, on the Non-core, another successful quarter of actively reducing the RWAs and some further gains on some of those division exits. You're now talking about narrowing that gap in the natural runoff. So based on the natural runoff you’ll be at 6% and you're aiming for 5%. So I think that is only another USD 5 billion inside of active RWA management in that business. And now you alluded to the close of the US mortgage servicing business will get you some way towards that. So, should we assume that active management within the NCL book is now largely complete or will be largely complete by the end of this year? And then my second question is just on costs. Previously, I think you were expecting to be at 50% by end 2024. You're now 55% guiding by end of 2024 of the total cost saving target of next so USD 500 million of cost saves you realized earlier than expected. Which division is it that these cost are coming through earlier than expected? And in your mind, is it purely just a timing issue that coming through earlier as opposed to a quantum issue that you're delivering more cost savings than expected? Thank you.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, thanks a lot, Andrew. On the second one in terms of on the costs and the performance and outperformance we're continuing to see. I mean, that's really driven, as I highlighted in my comments by NCL for sure, NCL is driven the lion's share of the gross cost saves to date while the other divisions have contributed, it has been really a function of their active rundown of positions, but also the restructuring of various parts of Credit Suisse as a G-SIB that we've highlighted in the past is an important part of taking out the costs. And a lot of those costs reside, you know, in NCL. So, they've been really the benefactor of the cost performance. And as we look out towards the end of the year, the additional progress that we anticipate, even though, as I suggest, we expect a bit a moderate deceleration in the gross cost saves, that's expected to be yielded also by NCL. And as I highlighted, you know, the core business divisions will then – the ratio of core to non-core or non-core to core in terms of cost takeout will invert as we get into the second half of the integration agenda and we'll start to see the significant cost reductions hitting through in particular GWM and P&C. And just on the first, in terms of how we see the natural runoff and the success we've had in the quarter, you know, of course, we're not counting on, you know, extrapolating and we take economic decisions as they arise and the opportunities arise. And so, you know, difficult to extrapolate the great outcome that we've had to date to suggest a different outcome than the natural roll-off. And that's why we continue to disclose it. So, you know, that becomes clear. What is important and Sergio commented this in his remarks that, you know, the uncertainty delta continues to narrow. And that's what you know, I think it's important that, you know, ultimately, while we can't count on anything in particular in terms of what can come off the balance sheet of NCL, in terms of extrapolation, what we can say is that the uncertainty delta has narrowed very significantly.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,That's clear. Thank you. I guess the follow on would just be your previous guidance was for a typical run rate of close to zero revenues from NCL per quarter and presuming that's unchanged?,14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,Thank you.,14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Hi there. Thank you. Two questions, please. First one, just follows on from just exactly what you were talking about there, the guidance for the P&L drag from NCL. Obviously, it's going better than expected, which is great to see. What would we expect now – previously you were talking about USD 2 billion P&L drag exit rate in 2025 and then USD 1 billion exiting 2026. And obviously it's going much better than that with sort of a UBS 1 billion drag in the second half that you're integrating. What should we expect for 2025? And could the NCL drag be finished within 2025 rather than carrying on into 2026? Any update on that would be really helpful. And then my second question, just a more sort of specific one on investment banking costs. They drifted up a little bit more than revenues in the second quarter, it's not a big move, but the cost income deteriorated against those strong revenues rather than perhaps you might have hoped it could have improved a little bit. So, any comments on the drivers, whether there's any one-offs in there or anything unusual, just how we should interpret that IB cost number, please",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So, Jeremy, thanks. On the second one in the comp on IB costs, it's the comp quarter, of course, only has Credit Suisse personnel in for a short period of time for just the one month when you look at the year-on-year comp, whereas the current quarters as you know the people we've added for the full quarters. So that's driving that that variance.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%. So, I was thinking more Q-on-Q.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"On – yeah on Q-on-Q, it would be just some compensation-related effects that were hitting through driving the Q-on-Q. But I'd have to - Go back and look at that. But really, it's more year-on-year that we focused on.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,Which is variable. Okay.,14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"On the – in terms of the guidance on the P&L drag and in NCL, in terms of what we should expect. Look, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance we've had to date, as I said in my last comments, there's no way to extrapolate from that performance is straight line and to assume that that's the, you know, the pace of which will continue. So, you know, we – our guidance remains, that's where in terms of the P&L drag at the end of 2026 is right now, still our best estimate when we come back and talk about an outlook in the fourth quarter going forward, you know, potentially we update that and see where we are. But for now, that's our best estimate in terms of where we land.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Understood. Thank you very much. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again for the disclosure. I hope some of the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard before from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are roughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share – share with us the advisory part of that so we can kind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be paying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates? And in that context, if you could briefly talk about lending, which was down ex-US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your offering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending? And then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further legal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what capital relief you expect from that or maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the changes that will happen in when you describe it here on the page.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Kian for the question. So on, in terms of the second one, first, the simplification that we talk about is continuing in the UK and in the US, but also in other parts of the world, to continue merging subsidiaries out of existence to create and unlock more capital, funding and tax efficiencies, so that's what we're getting to. So we're working all through that, you know, we just, of course, the big parent bank and Swiss bank mergers, we reparented the IHC, but now there's still a lot of work that will continue to unlock these benefits. So in terms of capital relief, naturally, to the extent that, and this goes a little bit to the question that was asked earlier in terms of the repatriation of excess capital, say in a subsidiary, of course, that is part of the analysis that we go through as we work through it. But it's, you know, there are contingencies to the timeline in terms of what triggers and what the timing could be to merge some of these entities out of existence. In terms of GWM, so, you know what I can say on the sweep deposits, first of all, advisory is about a third of the total, the total that we have in sweeps. So, just to give – to dimension that a bit, this is I think that's probably useful to understand. And then as far as the pricing it goes, of course, the way we're, first of all, it's a function of interest rates because I mentioned we're going to introduce the new rates in advisory in the fourth quarter because we have to change systems and go through some transitional work to get there. So, we have to see also where interest rates are. So in terms of an absolute price that I can’t offer, but what I can say is that we will for sure price in the value of the insurance coverage we offer on deposits that benefit from multiple programs, multiple bank programs and reciprocal programs that we've invested in and that will feature into the price of the rate we ultimately offer. In terms lending balances ex-US the main driver of that, I mean, you know, clearly we've seen deleveraging in a higher interest rate market for outside the US, particular in APAC for several quarters running. You know, we're looking forward and seeing some signs of tapering there, but we continue to see that. As I highlighted, you know, as rates come down, we do expect that should taper and then start – we start to see clients re- leverage. But so, the rate environment is driving some of that but the other part of it, perhaps the more significant driver is the financial resource optimization work we're doing that, you know, a consequence of that is that loans will roll off our platform, which is one of the points I highlighted in connection with the net new asset report. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at similar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last number we saw was $35.7 billion?",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah. What I can say Kian is that the number is across to come in a little bit and it's driven – is in also some of the comments I made on mix is driving the 2Q result. So you could assume that number has come a little bit lower and all I could say, you know, get anything further on the rate is, you know, as mentioned competitive dynamics you know will ultimately feature and how we what – we ultimately settle on a price – on price for the sweep deposits. So, you know, as I said, I gave some views on considerations that we – that we will factor in. But as far as an absolute price, you know, that's not at this point something that we have settled on. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thanks. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question – questions. The first one is just on the Basel IV impact of the USD 25 billion on the 1st of January 2025. I guess you said you will give us a bit more detail with potentially before year-end. But I mean, you previously talked about a USD 15 billion net of, yeah, Non-core rundown. Do you have a – can you give us a better indication of how the USD 25 billion will actually look on the 1st of January 2025? And then, sorry, coming back on the NII guidance, just confirming the P&C reiterating of guidance that's on the US dollar basis rather than Swiss francs. And just conceptually, I mean I see, I mean, you now assume more rate cuts than before, but the guidance is reiterated. Can you just maybe highlight what the missing pieces that allows you to reiterate guidance? Thank you very much.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, thanks, Anke. So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion’s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on – it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low – a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C. Anke Reingen, RBC Sorry, just to follow up. So on the 1st of January 25, as the 25 – I mean, the 5% increase in RWA or should it be lower because some mitigation or NCL run down has already kicked-in or reduced the impact?",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"No, no, the estimate is on the same basis we gave it in 4Q terms of the impact because it's mainly FRTB driven. So for now assume the guidance remains and as I said, if we have an update before we go live with it - of course we'll come back and provide it. Anke Reingen, RBC Okay. Thank you very much. Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first, you've guided for banking to generate almost twice the baseline revenues by 2026 assuming supportive markets. So, obviously performance was very strong in the second quarter. But then we saw this period of elevated volatility at the start of August. Has that changed anything in terms of how close we are now to supportive markets? And how would you expect the recovery to progress through the second half of this year? And then second question, just on profitability, at the start of the year, you said you'd expect to get to around 45% of the USD 13 billion gross savings by the end of 2024, and you've got that by the end of the first half. And you also guided for mid-single-digit underlying return on core tier one this year and mid to high for next year. Consensus is at 6% for this year and 9% for next year. But in the first half you're already above 9%. So how should we be thinking now about the path for underlying return on core tier one through 2024 and 2025?",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Chris. I'll take the first question. So, look, you know, I think, of course, the market environment, it's quite volatile and there are element of fragility that we see. But, you know, what is most important for us is to look through the short-term market dynamics. And, you know, I can tell you that I'm very confident that we are building up a very compelling pipeline in terms of mandate that we win still not announced and things that can be then executed in a normalized market environment. So, of course, if we see the kind of the volatility we had in a couple of weeks ago, that would not be very helpful for the pipeline. But in general, I'd stay, you know, I would say that - positive in respect of our momentum. So, a good pipeline and good momentum in winning mandates. But, of course, it will also depend on market conditions.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Chris, on the second, in terms of a return on core tier 1 and how it relates to our guidance. So, you know, as you mentioned, we initially guided it mid - for mid-single-digits for 2024 and mid-to-high for 2025. So naturally, if there's an update, we'll bring it to you and we talk about our 2025 expectations later this year. In terms of where we are, you know, as Sergio highlighted in his comments are the first six months we generated an underlying return on CET1 of 9.2%. So, obviously we're comfortably ahead of the target of mid for 2024. Amit Goel, Mediobanca Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So one, just to follow up, just to make sure I also had some of the previous guidance correctly. And I think you mentioned the cost of the reprice on sweep to be about USD 50 million annually. And so, I mean, I guess, given the one third advisory disclosure, that would imply only, you know, just over 40 bps of incremental cost on that portion and effectively nothing on the rest. So, I mean I was just kind of curious, I mean, in a way that you could continue to see outflows, so I'm wondering what the capacity is for the group to replace that funding at similar cost? And then also just linked to that, if I look then at the total sweep and the cost of the sweep, it seems like that the earnings are pretty similar to what Wealth Management Americas generates. So I'm just kind of curious how you think about Wealth Management Americas profitability and with some of these headwinds, how you think you'll get back to that mid-teens operating margin? And then secondly, just curious on the parent, you know, is there any scope to shift exposure from foreign participations to domestic in addition to capital repatriation? And, you know, whether that can be reflected in participation values and, you know, if there is potentially will change coming. Thank you.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Amit. Yeah, in terms of the second one, shifting exposure domestically, you know, whether that helps, it's way too early to speculate on how we're going to address and what actions we take. We don't know what the standards are. So, and where they'll move to mean – where the standards will move, assuming they move. And so to speculate about what mitigating actions might be available to us is way too early. Terms of sweeps, yeah, I disclosed that the impact on pre-tax profit is expected be around USD 50 million annualized in the US Wealth Business. You know, I did say that that's net of offsetting factors. So, that includes an array of banking initiatives and expense programs across various categories. So, there, I wouldn't take the USD 50 million as gross income, but actually, as I said, it is a net impact. And I think, look, you know, I saw interesting that you asked the question and then, you know, lead to how we're going to address, you know, the pre-tax margin issues. You know, we – nothing has changed on that. We're, you know, we're focused on that, we know we have to do. The sweep deposit issue, you know, is a modest hit on that, of course, because it's something we're saying is adverse to PBT. We think it's manageable and now we're getting on with the work of improving the margins on the basis of how we described that in the past. So, we know we have to do there and we're taking steps to achieve that.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Hi, good morning. Two questions, please. So the first one on GWM in particular, America, the cost/income ratio remains above 90% and it was better during low interest rate times. So just wondering with the mix shift from NII, and NII falling [indiscernible] most likely, you see upside to year-end 2026 cost/income ratio improvement in target. And then secondly on the capital side, you obviously have the group guiding for 14% CET1, but you see the 12.5% more the binding constraint and that's the first half of the question. The second, with Switzerland being the only geography introducing FRTB and not delaying it, do you think that's the final piece of the puzzle in terms of higher capital requirements for you? Thank you.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Let me take the second part of the question. Of course, you know, with the 14% guidance we have right now it stays as it is, and the 12.5%you mentioned it look-through fully applied 2030 at current requirements, we will see exactly how things develop in the next few quarters in terms of future requirements. From FRTB standpoint of view, of course, as you mentioned, Switzerland will introduce that on January 1. It will be a short-term competitive disadvantage, we don't believe it's – we believe it's manageable short-term. Of course, this, should other jurisdictions not converge, not to converge to Basel III full implementation over the next couple of years then, of course, that would be – it will be more problematic and we would need to think about how to address this matter. So, we remain confident that we will be able to have a level playing field in how we operate and compete globally. But it remains to be seen.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Benjamin, here's how we think about the – your cost/income ratio question for GWM. You know, we're – we have a look through cost to income ratio presently of around 80%. You know, naturally when we plan the USD 13 billion of gross cost saves and the less than 70% cost income ratio, GWM factors in quite prominently in that piece of work. And that's why, you know, I've highlighted that the cost income ratio will be benefited by the work that just going to get going in the next quarter or two, which is the client account migration work and platform consolidation starting in APAC and parts of Europe before the Swiss booking center. That will drive significant cost down and ultimately, you know, which is why I believe that Wealth and P&C will benefit significantly in the latter half of the integration work. So in terms of where we get our cost income ratio, it will – GWM's cost to income ratio in the end will be a big contributor to the group meeting its target of less than 70% by the end of 2026.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Thanks for that. This was in particular on the Americas for GWM Americas, but you probably won't see much of a cost save benefit, but correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, indeed from the 90 – from the 90% right now, more towards the 85%, accelerate with the different revenue mix?",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Question was on the Americas, sorry I didn’t hear it. Look, as I said also to the before and I've said previously, we're working towards the mid-teens profit margin over the next couple of years. That's where, you know, we know we have to narrow the gap where we are, that's where we are working towards. And that also features into the, you know, the less than 70% cost/income ratio by the end of 2026, getting to that level. So, you know, nothing that I've guided to today has changed any of that. We're very focused on taking the steps to achieve that by that in that timeframe.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,Thank you.,14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallet,KBW,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just – what do you assume in terms of loan and deposit growth in the Swiss business NII guide and your GWM growth in the second half of the year? And then secondly, how do you see deposit mix shift and deposit betas evolving within that guide as well? Thank you.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of – in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.",14 August 2024,2Q24,2q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Okay, there are no more questions. Thank you all for calling in and your questions. And see you in end of October for the Q3 results. Thank you. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including elevated inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on its reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on its business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. UBS’s business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in its past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form 20- F for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play – that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Stefan. Thanks for your questions. So, in terms of the outstanding SNB funding, no, it's – we still have the – that funding levels are still unchanged at this stage. We are working through our business plans and as well as our funding plans. And we'll consider the ability to repay some or all of that over the course of the coming months, but your read was correct. In connection with that funding and the Liq. Ordinance, no. I'd say there's no specific connection with that. And we're not maintaining that funding, particularly in respect of satisfying the Liquidity Ordinance per se. That said, the LCR guidance that you're looking for, as we say, will remain prudent. So you can expect it to remain at levels not terribly far away from where we finished 3Q at.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,"Great that’s very helpful, thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it's very early and I guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stones that we should look out for before you can resume a buyback? That's my first question. And then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs and the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? Can we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is the legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Okay. Thank you. So in respect of the capital distribution plan or capital return plans, as you pointed out, you're going to have to be patient. You know, is for the time being I just can reiterate that we are still looking to have a progressive cash dividend policy that will be implemented. And for the rest, you need to have – what you need to see is the visibility with the plan. So we are finalizing the three-year plan and that will allow us to really calibrate capital returns. I just want to reiterate, I still believe at this stage, although the plan is not finished, that capital returns and share buybacks is not a matter of years. In my point of view, it could be a matter of quarters. But without having the final plan, it's difficult to really make a final statement. But that will be addressed in February. And somehow, it's linked to your second question because, of course, I'm not so sure, I would define the progress we've made so far as low hanging fruit. But I think that it takes efforts and time to go through this. I do believe that we still have costs that can be taken out during 2024, regardless of what you are pointing out being the critical issue is the legal entity merger. The legal entity merger is the triggering point that allow us to go to the next level of cost reduction and synergy realizations from an operational standpoint of view, but also from an IT stand point of view. So 2024, as Todd mentioned, is the – and I also remarked, is a pivotal year, is probably the one time in which we're going to incur the most costs in order to achieve the synergies that we'll achieve in 2025 and 2026. So, you see how the two questions are somehow linked.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Thank you.,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning. Two questions from me, please. Firstly, on the GWM net interest income trajectory. Thank you for the commentary in your prepared remarks. I think you said after a 3% decline in Q3, you expected mid-single-digit percentage decline in Q4 and that there's an ongoing deposit mix shift. So that seems to be accelerating rather than decelerating. So can you give us any indication of how much longer you think that trend could continue for? Do you think now that we're at peak rates, if anything, that should slow as we go into 2024? And also, if there's any implications from your broader deposit pricing that's also influencing that sequential NII decline. That's the first question. Second question, there's been quite a lot of media commentary over the past week ahead of the Too Big To Fail review coming out in spring next year. I think there's been some explicit discussion around potentially introducing more exit fees or more notice periods around deposits. So, anything you could say with regards to that and also what that means for your competitive positioning versus international peers? Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. On the first in terms of GWM NII trajectory, I think you captured it right in terms of guidance around a mid-single digit decline owing to deposit mix shifts and whether that seems like an acceleration. I'd comment that I think what we're seeing is a bit of a broadening of that dynamic more across the globe. We saw in most of 2023 that dynamic being very significantly driven by moves from sweep deposits into higher yielding deposits in the US. And we saw less of that in Europe and APAC, as well as in Switzerland. And so while we're seeing the US taper now, both in the current quarter and as we look ahead, we're seeing a bit of an expansion of that dynamic in other parts of the globe, and that's what's sort of driving that. As I look out into 2024, we're doing that work now. We'll come back with a view during February with a view on full year 2024. I would just conclude on the point saying, no, I don't see pricing having an impact. I mean, this is just a response to the current rate environment as clients are undergoing cash sorting across our client base.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So in respect of what you mentioned and changes in the law or regulations around liquidity. I think I can only say that it's pretty difficult to track all the rumors, speculations and ideas that are coming up, almost daily. On the Swiss media, I think that I can only tell you that, that at this stage what stands is that even the Finance Minister took an official stance on the matter. I mean, those are speculations. I don't believe this is going to be part of the package. I think that - I'm convinced that Switzerland will keep its standards in terms of allowing – or responding to the crisis in March, not only the one in Switzerland, but broadly speaking, with following the recommendation that it will be set by the FSB and other bodies. And in that sense, I don't see us being particularly disadvantaged compared to any other jurisdictions in terms of a Liquidity Ordinance. So, I guess that we will follow up and I think it's going to still take months and months before the full analysis of what happened will translate into concrete actions.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had a one big picture question on revenues and then a follow-up on the operational risk RWA. Big picture, your revenues at the minute are annualizing to low-40 billions or so. Clearly, your target has a number, which is probably USD 50 billion-plus. Just want to understand how you see the revenue bridge from here through to 2027 and what the key moving parts should be, particularly in the context of some of your GWM trends, which at the minute seem to be down before we go back up. And then, secondly, on operational risk, I just want to understand some of the assumptions that are going into your Basel IV guidance there. Clearly there's some uncertainty around ILM. There's a bit of uncertainty about what losses to use in that standardized calculation. So what losses from the Credit Suisse business are you having to carry forward and how does that impact your operational risk RWA? And then, finally, can I just clarify on the Basel 3.1 finalization guidance, is that 5% ex. any moves in operational risk? Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Adam. So in terms of revenues, I'm not so sure we ever indicated that we have a USD 50 billion plus revenue. I don't know where this figure is coming from. What I remember saying back in August is that our targets, our ambitions for 2026 are not based on blue sky scenarios on revenues. So, if anything, I guided to the contrary of that. So we are definitely focused on costs and we are definitely also focusing on the denominator. So we need to basically focus on managing and utilizing in a better way the resources and the risk-weighted assets that we have right now. I have to go back to the critical point. Mission number one we have had in the last six months and in the foreseeable future is to restructure Credit Suisse, okay? And then we're going to talk about synergies and then we're going to talk about growth. But, before we talk about growth of the top line, we need to restructure and reset the basis. And in that sense, believe me, we are not counting on blue sky scenarios and that figure is not really our figure.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Can I ask for a better landing point then?,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Okay. Thank you.,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Adam, on your second question in terms of op risk RWA and modeling, as I mentioned, we did an initial impact assessment. It was quite dynamic. We've had only initial discussions with our regulator at this point in time, naturally ahead of the formal introduction of Basel III final for op risk RWA, there'll be much more extensive interactions with the regulator to agree on the particulars around the ILM, as you say. We made certain modeled assumptions for now, as well as the loss history. We made certain assumptions about the loss history and the roll off of certain legacy matters. So, it was a thoughtful analysis, a good initial view, but it's going to be one that requires more work and more engagement with our regulator over the coming months. On the 5%, actually, no, it's not ex-op risk, it's inclusive. But given that, op risk we're saying, as I said in my remarks, we see that as broadly unchanged from now. The maths are the same either way.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Perfect. Thank you very much.,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Flora Bocahut,Jefferies,"Yes. Good morning. I'd like to talk about the net new money, especially at CS this quarter, because if I look at extrapolating the quarterly changes in net new money at CS that we've seen over the past two quarters, it seems to point to a run rate where you gain USD 20 to USD 30 billion of net new money per quarter. But then, if I try and reconcile just the month of September from what you had disclosed with Q2, it looks like there's been a slowdown actually in net new money at CS with just USD 2 billion in Wealth this month. So what should I consider as a more normalized level from here? Is it going to be still the pace we saw over quarterly basis or there is a slowdown because the environment is tougher. You probably have visibility there with what happened in October. And the second question is actually following up on this. I know you are going to provide us with the strategic update at the full year, but any hint as to what kind of assumptions you've made in your RoCET1 target towards 2026 regarding the AUM level, especially considering the fact that the market effect is starting for the more negative now. Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Flora. Thanks for the questions. So, on the net new money for Credit Suisse Wealth, I appreciate your doing a fair bit of the extrapolation math but a long time in this business tells me that extrapolating net new money trends is probably not necessarily the way to go, certainly not from you know, a month or so. The point we've made is that we've stabilized the business. We're seeing inflows after massive outflows and that for us, as Sergio highlighted, was really objective number one, was to stabilize the business and that we've achieved. Look, going forward in any case, we're going to be reporting these metrics on a combined basis. We're just giving an indication because we talked about that in the second quarter. We gave an indication even up to the late publication date towards the end of August. So, we, Sergio and I, wanted to follow through on that and offer that perspective, but the expectation going forward in any case is that Wealth Management, which is how we manage the business, will be providing a combined net new money plus dividend and interest figure going forward. And in terms of the RoCET1 assumptions in terms of AUM levels, we're doing that work now. Naturally, when we develop the landing zone targets that we articulated in the second quarter, we had a view on growth, but now we're validating that in our business planning process and we'll come back and offer specificity around that in February.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Flora Bocahut,,Thank you.,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,Exane BNP Paribas,"Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to ask two questions about non-core, if I could. The first one on the RWA outlook, you've had a great start already reducing that balance down quite effectively. The runoff you show in the slide is effectively the natural runoff with no action, but clearly you are taking action. So, is it reasonable for us to expect that rather than being down 50%, it could be down 75% or 100% within that sort of three-year timeframe? It seems that you're on a more aggressive trajectory than that passive runoff that you're showing in the slide. And then, the second question is also about non-core, about the P&L. So you're annualizing in this quarter around USD 1 billion positive revenues and USD 5 billion of costs. I just wonder is that a representative starting point for us to sort of model non-core going forward? And linked to that, how much could that change in 2024? Could we see – will we still see positive revenues in 2024 in non-core? And how much could we expect the costs to reduce in 2024 in non-core?",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"I think, Todd, I mean, let me start with taking the one on – you know we are giving as we mentioned last time, we just give you a flavor for the natural decay in order for you to understand that, what will be the leftover in case we do nothing. And as you pointed out, we have been pretty active. Having said that, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to take down 100% or 75% to 100% per se because it all depends on at what terms we will do it. The very critical topic here is that we have to do it in a way that creates value and not just headlines. So, we can get rid of probably many of those positions, but destroying a lot of value. And this will be in conflict with capital accretion and the ability for us to return capital to shareholders. So, I think that it's very clear what is the framework we are using and I think objective number one around non- core is not necessarily just to accelerate the wind down of assets, but it's to take down cost. That's the much more critical element of freeing up capacity and resources.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Jeremy, on the P&L question, for sure, on the revenue side, I would not annualize the current quarter's revenues. The revenues are a function of – the market through which we would exit these positions. It depends on the nature of the positions we're talking about. It depends on market conditions. We'll be opportunistic and everything, Sergio just said that actually informs the dynamic about the speed, the timing, the intensity of when we get out of positions is, of course, what governs in that respect. So, I would put no sort of target or certain extrapolation. Certainly, no extrapolation to the current quarter's revenues in NCL is saying, well that's a run rate. On the cost side, I would argue that's different because there you're looking at – on the underlying OpEx, you're looking at, at this point, the run rate cost to support the rundown of the business. So, as that business runs down, you would expect that the costs associated, the underlying OpEx supporting the portfolio will also run down. Now, that may not be linear and I wouldn't expect it to be linear, but it ought to be somewhere in some way, shape or form correlated with the size of the balance sheet as it starts to diminish over time.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Andrew Lim,Société Générale,"Hi. Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just turning to tax. Obviously, we saw some nice RWA reduction, but it was negated by the high tax charge. But at the same time, you're talking about mergers of the divisional structure to enable you to reduce the effective tax rate. I was wondering if you could give us more specificity on when we can expect that to happen. And would that be a gradual process for the reduction in the effective tax rate, or would that be actually a step-down change there? And then, my second question is, you've done a good job on costs, well done there. The exit run rates for the end of the year, I was wondering if you could update us on that.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mentioned in my remarks, certainly the elevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre-tax at the moment, in particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we're not able to offset – even within the jurisdictions - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they fall out. So there could be expenses or losses in one entity that's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating taxable profits. And that's indeed what's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entities in particular, as you'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are separate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happening on the CS AG side that you would otherwise ideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn't happening until we start the mergers. Now, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it's gradual? We'll see both. I mean, certainly we'll see some immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder planning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you’ll see once the mergers take place over the course of 2024, you'll see some step down. But you'll also, as I said, gradually see the rate come back in. In terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess of USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We're undertaking actions at present. We haven't quantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale,"That’s great. Thank you. Amit Goel, Barclays Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking – are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks for the questions, Amit. So, on the legal entities, in terms of the main pieces and the timing, obviously, the big groups to address are the parent banks that will take place, the two Swiss banks and then the US IHCs and the subsidiaries below. I mean, I'd say those are – and in the UK as well. And those are going to be the biggest chunks. Of course, across the globe, there's also a lot of undertaking in Europe and in Asia. But the big – I highlighted the big pieces because that's what you were looking for. We are working hard on developing plans for all of those. I think it's fair to say over the course of 2024, I won’t at this stage, speculate on exact timing, but we'll provide more updates as we go and as we enter the year and as we go through the year, we'll give you more specificity around timelines. In terms of the revenue picture in the fourth quarter, I mean, as you mentioned, repeating back that I offered some NII guidance for our core businesses in terms of underlying NII. We do see the potential for transactional activities. I mean, the market for transactional activities is a bit clouded at the moment. We are seeing some risk off even though, earlier this month certainly some of the less hawkish sentiment, coupled with further rate hike pauses, and seeing bonds and equities rally more recently, that would suggest perhaps more risk on. But I think that's all counterbalanced as well in our clients' minds also about what's happening in the Middle East. And so we do see the potential for TRX in our asset gathering businesses as well as transactional activity in our IB to potentially be affected by that. And as you mentioned, seasonality will for sure, in any event, be a factor. So I'd say the revenue picture is a bit clouded, but I, at this point, wouldn't necessarily expect it to increase quarter-on-quarter significantly at this stage. Amit Goel, Barclays Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yes. That's correct. There is a lot of planning to be done. The planning manuals are incredibly extensive. And of course, it needs to be approved by the regulators. And when you think about the parent bank and how many jurisdictions they operate in, you're talking about regulators across the world. So these are not simple transactions by any stretch of the imagination. Amit Goel, Barclays Okay. Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first, if you could maybe speak about the profitability of the recovery of funds and assets of Credit Suisse and how that's going, the discussion with clients there. And the second is, it looks like, in particular, non-core significantly outperformed your expectation you set in Q2 in the third quarter. So just wondering, what does it mean for the budget, so to say, you have to, for an accelerated rundown in Q4 and beyond. Thank you.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do – as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at – in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a – the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been – we are – very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite – I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around – or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So – and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it’s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,Good. Thank you.,7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me. So, on profitability, clearly better than expected in the quarter. Previously, you'd guided for positive underlying PBT in H2 and breakeven in the third quarter. So, given the third quarter is already quite positive, does that change how we should think about Q4? I guess the old guidance implied a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of PBT. So just wondering whether that's still the right way to think about that. And then, second, and I appreciate it's a bit of a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on CS net new money. You've given the regional disclosure on a combined basis, but I just wanted to check whether the combined regional picture, sort of Asia strong, EMEA strong, Switzerland more balanced. Is that consistent across both the CS and UBS Wealth franchises?",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look – meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Thanks, Todd. Helpful.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements | This presentation contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, recent terrorist activity and escalating armed conflict in the middle east, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined bank; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and labor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of Credit Suisse, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of Credit Suisse, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities currently existing in the Credit Suisse Group, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.",7 November 2023,3Q23,3q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Unknown,,"Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on buyback in 2025. The second quarter stage, you were not commenting yet on buyback. Clearly, that changed at a recent conference and reconfirming this, Sergio, today as well. I just wanted to understand what the thinking is in terms of changing the buyback view in 2025 and how that fits into the regulatory regime changes that might come in the future. And in that context, if you could just also indicate if you will make any comments with the full-year results, as you will give us a buyback for 2025, how that fits with regulatory changes, especially I’m referring to the parent bank capital issue? And then the second question is on US wealth management. Are you seeing a peak in yield-seeking from depositors at this point? And we're hearing from US peers that there are some stabilization in sweep accounts. So I'm just trying to understand how lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially impact loan growth, as I can see it's flattish in the quarter.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,," Okay. Thanks, Kian. Well, look, if I – if you go back into our remarks, my remarks, in the past, I always clearly stated that starting a buyback program in 2024 would be at the start of a journey that would not be a stop-and-go kind of strategy. So I always, and we always, flagged the fact that in 2025 we would have a share buyback. Now we are reiterating that guidance by saying that we do expect in the early part of 2025, as we present Q4 results, to tell, like we did this year, the amount of ambitions or the size of the ambitions we have for 2025. So in that sense, I think that's – I just – we are just reiterating our commitments, also in respect of our ambitions for 2026 is that, of course, they are subject to requirements – potential new requirements in Switzerland, and then we will assess. But our ambition is to have similar returns we had before the acquisition by 2026. Now for 2025, early 2025, your question, are we going to have more clarity? I don't know. We are not really in control of the timing. I think, I suspect, that we won't be able give a lot of guidance on that – in that sense, because, as you know, we are still going through technical discussions. The consultation process probably is gonna start late this year or even in the early part of next year and is gonna to take a few– few months, so it's very unlikely that in February we will be able to give much more clarity on this topic. And so this is very unlikely then to affect 2025 capital returns ambitions. And, you know, that also implies that there is no change in terms of the parent bank. As you saw, our parent bank, our overall capital position it's very strong. And also, when you look at our parent bank capital at 13.3% is very solid, is already on a fully applied basis and with a methodology on how we look at valuation of assets and subsidiaries, that is quite conservative definitely compared to what we saw in the past.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Kian. Regarding your second question, in terms of lower rates and impact on our US wealth business. So first on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will – and I made this comment earlier in my remarks – you know, should spur additional lending opportunities across the division, including in the US. On the deposit side, in particular on sweeps, so first I'd say a couple of things, that we are seeing sweep deposits continue to taper. But in the quarter, we did have smaller outflows, so still about a billion of outflows. You know, I'd say that some of the market dynamics that I see in this regard, you know, one is that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are doing. Secondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra-high net worth. And for sure, that asset band tends to have a much lower percentage of AuM in sweeps. So that's going to be a market dynamic for us that will always weigh on, you know, that, that sensitivity, just given that with a more high net worth client base where there's more sensitivity in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally then there'll be lower balances and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see – we will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in ‘25 versus ‘24? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the ‘24 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Hi, Chris. So maybe just address your second question initially. Just in terms of the pre-tax profit in the Americas region. No, no one-offs. Just, you know, I would comment that, first of all, strongest revenue quarter ever. So there, you know, certainly seeing that as a strength. You know, we continue to see revenues growing nicely, up 3% sequentially in the region and 9% year-on-year and so, no one-offs. You see as well, I highlighted in my comments the transaction revenues continue to be a real plus for us, you know, as we borrowed a page from our strategy outside the US in terms of working hand in hand with the IB and working with clients and bringing them our product shelf in transactions. So really generating good transactional growth in that respect. Look, we're going to – we know what we need to do and we're going to stay focused on continuing to, you know, chip away at our goals. It's not going to happen overnight and we'll continue to come back and talk about, you know – in fact in the fourth quarter, we'll give more of a perspective on how we see things and the signposts you can look to. In terms of 2025 and, you know, I'd say, you know, first off, you know, if you look out into 4Q, you asked, I mean, other than the, you know, the seasonality that we highlighted in the fourth quarter, a bit on the top line that you would normally see, despite the momentum we saw coming into 4Q. Also, a little bit on the expense side, as I highlighted in my comments, a bit of the, you know, somewhat seasonal uptick and some one-offs like the UK bank levy. But away from that, no, I mean, nothing that we're seeing, and nothing on the CET1 capital ratio that I would – that I would highlight. You know, as we look out, you know, I don't think we want – we don't think it's appropriate to draw a straight line or extrapolate from the strong return on CET1 we've generated this year. I think we just have to keep doing the things that we said we're going to do. We know we have costs that have to continue to come out at this point. That's going to be the biggest driver of getting us to a cost-income ratio below 70% and returns to around 15% by the end of 2026. We know that's the ambition for us and we're going to work over the next two years to get there. But, you know, at this point, I wouldn't extrapolate necessarily from our ’24 performance to draw a line into ‘25.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,Okay. Thanks very much.,30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Yes, hi. Good morning. So two questions from me. Todd, you mentioned some balance sheet optimization efforts that have lifted revenues over RWAs by 3 percentage points. I was wondering if you could shed some light on, you know, these measures and how much is left to come? I think in Q4, you highlighted some NII [Edit: NNA] impact, and I was wondering how much of that has already come through? And then aside from the quarter, and going back to the US wealth business, in my understanding, once you get to 15% PBT and once you have done with the CS integration, you could consider some inorganic growth opportunity to further improve margins. But isn't this at odds with the Too Big to Fail proposal the way it is written at the moment, which sort of penalizes growth in foreign subsidiaries? And how do you square the two? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business – really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so – and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited – albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle – we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,," Yeah. Giulia, on the second question, I think that first of all, I think it would be premature to draw a conclusion around what the new regulation will be. Having said that, you have to balance that, you know, one aspect that has been clearly outlined by the Swiss Federal Council proposal is that their intention, or their desire, to keep Switzerland, and broadly speaking, also UBS, as a competitive global player. So I can't really see how this is possible with the, you know, with a regime that would penalize expansion globally. So in that sense, I think it's, we – as we mentioned before, we do believe that whatever the new regime will be, it will be something that fits into this strategic direction outlined by the Federal Council, and a desire to correct some aspect of the current regulation, which broadly speaking, is a very strong regulation, one of the most demanding ones when fully applied and consistently applied. That was not the case in the Credit Suisse situation. UBS is a completely different situation. We believe we have a very strong capital position, a balance sheet for all seasons, and we are able to sustain both a global business model, but also staying very close to our own markets and sustain the economy. So, you know, when we have all the facts, we will draw strategic conclusions on what to do. It's now premature to do that.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Thank you.,30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous,"Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one I wanted to ask is, I noticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the second quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that the rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then? And another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested in some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 360 ONE. You may not be able to comment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative of any strategic desire to shift more onshore and more into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move? Thank you very much.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Stefan. How are you? On the first – yeah, good spot. So the – that asymmetry is a function of now, in the lower interest rate environment in Swiss franc terms, it's just the loan flooring dynamics that come into play from negative interest rates. So you see that the down 100 basis points scenario will have a much more limited impact, or an asymmetrical impact to the up 100 basis point impact, in particular in Swissy.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah. And on the second question, you're right, we are not going to comment on any speculations or rumors, but, you know, we do believe that Asia-PAC is a growth business. We have now a stronger presence in India thanks to the combination of the UBS and Credit Suisse capabilities. We always look at ways to enhance our businesses in each key locations where we operate, but I wouldn't draw a conclusion that we are thinking about major strategic moves in terms of segment focus at this stage.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous,Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.,30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Morning. Thank you. Just a couple of follow ups on wealth management actually and they’re both things that you've touched on, but I just want to get into a bit more detail. The first one was on advisor numbers, which are coming down a little bit more, sort of as expected in this quarter. But I just wondered where you are in that process and what the outlook is for, you know, how much more reduction in advisor numbers do you expect? And is there a point at which that returns to growth mode, or does it stay in optimization mode for a continued period of time? So, advisor numbers. And then the second question was just to talk a bit more about Asia in wealth management. You referred to the stimulus, you referred to the pickup in transaction activity, so I just wondered where you think we are in that process? And for example, whether you're seeing signs of re-leveraging and just how much improvement you see ahead of us in that Asia process?",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Jeremy. Yeah. So first on Asia. Yeah, we're really pleased with the performance in GWM APAC and thanks for recognizing that as well. You know, you see the sequential progress, this, you know, having transaction-based income up in 3Q versus 2Q, really proud of that result. And then you see the year-on- year quite strong. You know, in terms of where we are, I think, you know, this – we have, I would argue we have a long road ahead in the sense of good upside, just given that, you know, the business is first coming together now on the same platform. I mean, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of that. You know, with the Hong Kong client account migration just having been completed this past weekend, and we're looking forward to Singapore and Japan in the fourth quarter. I mean, these are things that are really going to just further bring the business together. And, you know, I think from here, lower rates, you know, let's see, but re-leveraging opportunity, as you mentioned, the business is very focused. I think the business is, you know, is positioning itself to fire on all cylinders in APAC. And I'm very, very bullish about that. So in terms of where we are in the process, I think, you know, obviously it's been a good backdrop in this last quarter, but I think there are really good things ahead. In terms of the advisor numbers, I would sort of, you know, look at that in two ways. First, you know, on the non-US or what we call the Swiss and International part of GWM, you know, I would say from an advisor perspective, it is still – optimization’s probably the word – to come together. I think, you know, it's – lion's share of that's been complete. You know, I've talked about the Credit Suisse client advisors leaving for some period of time, and that's been an old story, and it's just really the tail of it that we talk about maybe as a headwind a bit, on net new assets. But in terms of the advisor headcount, you know, I just see the teams as they come together as well once all the platform work is complete, you know, I think then we get to a point and that of stability, and from there the business can make targeted investments in specific regions to grow for sure, but to already leverage at scale. I think the US we need to, a bit, take a wait-and-see, and see what the leadership comes back with a bit and they – as they do their strategic reviews and we'll talk – Sergio and I will come out and talk a bit in the fourth quarter about that. You know, I think, you know, it has been a story of somewhat trying to get more productive with a smaller advisor workforce over a number of years. And we'll have to see if that's, you know, the direction of travel that the current leadership wants to go.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Great. Thank you. Amit Goel, Mediobanca Hi. Thank you. Yeah. So two questions for me, also one on the US wealth business. I found it really interesting, the commentary about potentially looking at acquisitions. I guess what I'm just wondering is then, you know, from a strategy standpoint, if part of the issue in terms of operating margin is the scale and the cost base relative to the revenues, you know, is it now then the case that it's cheaper to acquire than to simply just hire? Because, you know, the US, you know, as you say, is, the focus has been on productivity, reducing FA numbers. So I'm just trying to think, is that because, you know, these 400% recruitment deals are now just too expensive to make it worthwhile, but it's actually just cheaper to buy an organization? And then secondly, just going back on the deposits and the roll-off of the fixed term deposits within wealth, I'm just curious, were those kind of written 12 months ago and, you know, were those done at, kind of, quite high rates? So just curious if there's also potentially some of that effect into Q4 and start of next year? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Hi, Amit. Yeah. So on the deposits question, yeah, these were written, you know, basically they're – they have a year maturity so you start to see, we start in 2Q already, ones that were written just in the wake of the acquisition, you know, all the way through, I would say, you know, the end of the year of 2023 into the very beginning of this year. And they had – they were competitive in terms of pricing for sure, as part of, you know, stabilizing the franchise and engaging with clients. So for sure and so now as they mature, you know, the question, and that's what I've been highlighting in the last couple of quarters, the question becomes, you know, what we call landing, we refer to them as landing those deposits in the sense of converting them into other parts of the platform as we've been doing successfully. Retaining is the key, you know, is the key objective and retaining them in a more profitable manner. We're doing that quite successfully, but it's a headwind on NNA that we've absorbed, in these NNA metrics that I've been highlighting insofar as you know, there is still some that are leaving the platform. In terms of the outlook we still see elevated, I think 3Q is the peak, but we still see elevated maturing FTDs in the fourth quarter and into the front part of the first quarter before, you know, we could get this issue a bit in the rearview.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Well, in respect, again, I guess on this potential inorganic thing, you know, I have to say that Colm made it very clear that it's not a tomorrow-morning kind of issue, so I think it's totally premature to speculate how – if and how – we would do any such a move. Our priority right now is to improve what we do in the US, bringing the margins to, narrowing the margins to our peers and doing better what we have today, and then potentially by doing that, and we're going to create also the optionality and to really choose what is – fits best, is it an organic growth or is it inorganic, and what fits the best in our business model, which is asset gathering-centric. The scale issue in the US is pretty much driven by the fact that we have a banking platform, a G-SIB platform de facto as – through the intermediate holding company – that can accommodate different banking businesses, which we don't have. So again, I think that, you know, once we finish this chapter of restoring the profitability at the levels we want to be, and we fully extract the value of our investments in the Investment Bank and the collaboration between the Investment Bank and Wealth Management and Asset Management, we will determine the next phase. Now, it's really way too early to speculate. Anke Reingen, RBC Hi. Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. Just two small ones on capital, please. The first one is on the core tier 1 ratio staying, I mean ex the accelerated amortization, stable quarter-on-quarter. And that's in spite of a really strong, like, profit capital generation. I mean, I realized there are a number of things going on, including FX, but is there something else we should keep in mind that only means the capital ratio is flat or you're investing more capital into organic growth? Otherwise, I guess given the strong earnings, the expectation will be the capital generation drives the ratio higher. And then secondly, just on the Basel IV impact, just to confirm, would that be at the UBS AG, would the impact be around 30 basis points as well? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi Anke. Yeah. So on the first – on your first question in terms of the capital accretion, ex the acceleration of transitional adjustment, I think there are a few factors to consider. You know, one is the FX sensy, I mean you mentioned that, but you know we disclosed that there is an FX sensy of 18 basis points on our capital with respect to a 10% depreciation in the dollar, you know, versus our major currencies. If you look at – if you look at currencies in 3Q in particular, the Swissy dollar was down around 6% from the beginning of the quarter until the end. And the pound versus the dollar, similar dynamic. So that accounts for, you know, close to 0.1% on the capital ratio that the currency effects this quarter as you mentioned so that's one piece. Another piece is just the temporary difference deferred tax assets, you know, given the reduction in the CET1 level of capital from the acceleration, we are at the 10% threshold. So we lose a bit, you know, goes over the 10% and therefore lose the benefit of the temp difference DTA, which has a modest impact. And then third, just slightly increasing the accrual for future award hedging, future share award hedges. That's in our capital so that also has an impact. So those all contribute to probably why you would have expected maybe on net profit, other things equal, to be potentially slightly above the 15 handle. Anke Reingen, RBC Ok, thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Sorry, on the Basel III final impact on the parent bank. It won't be the entire 30 basis points affecting the parent bank but it should be most of – the most of it, there might be some that falls outside. But again, if you're talking also the parent bank standalone, it won't be all of it because still a fair bit of activity that's subject to the Basel III changes, you know, are happening in subsidiaries, not in the parent bank itself. So I would expect that there'll be some but not all of the 30 basis point impact in the parent bank itself. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you very much.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple, both related to revenues. Firstly, coming back to the US sweep deposits and repricing. Thank you firstly for the additional color around the slightly less than 50 million PBT impact. But can I ask if you could possibly break out revenue gross impact versus the cost save offset on that? And also, do the class action suits in the SEC probe have any implications on pricing dynamics in your mind for the industry as well as for you going forward? And then the second question actually on loans, if you adjust out for FX, you've seen a CHF 10 billion decline Q-on-Q. You reiterated this point about committing to CHF 350 billion loan book across P&C and GWM Switzerland. You're now running a bit below that, I think you’re closer to CHF 340 [billion]. So, just to be clear, is the CHF 350 [billion] a commitment throughout this period or is it a case of you expect to trend down and then recover back to that CHF 350 [billion]? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Andrew. So on the second one, look, it's a commitment you know to maintain around that level. So, you know, we've been doing the balance sheet work that I've been highlighting in my remarks, both in P&C and GWM. And, you know, in P&C, we actually saw net new loan outflows, as I highlighted, of about CHF 6 billion this quarter. This is a commitment that we've made to the market and you can look at that as an ambition that we’ll continue to focus on and commit to. But, of course, we're also running the business so there might be volatility quarter-on-quarter on that. In terms of – in terms of the sweep, you were looking for some more information. You know, I had mentioned in the past that, look, the gross would be a low single-digit percentage of the divisional net interest income. So with you know, that was even based on where rates were when we gave the guidance last quarter so as rates now are coming in, you know, as mentioned, that will have a lower impact on the gross as well as a lower impact on the net. That should give you, though, a general sense of the impact.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Yes. Good morning. Two questions, please, from my side. First on Investment Bank. You outperformed across equities and fixed income, would just be interested in a bit more color, what you attribute to between the two? Is it lower base, is Credit Suisse now fully at revenue run rate or business mix? Anything else you would flag? And then secondly, GWM and also P&C net interest income outperformed your own guidance. Just wondering why that was in your view and why the Q4 guidance could be conservative or not? So what could be worse this time? Thank you.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Hi, Benjamin. So on the second, in terms of, you know, our guidance last quarter, we extended duration of our equity and we saw higher reinvestment income as I highlighted in my comments and that had, you know, a positive effect on GWM's NII. And therefore we came in flattish versus sort of a low-to-mid guidance. So, that would explain that. On the P&C side, I think we saw some positive effects of the balance sheet optimization work that had, you know, a strong impact in the third quarter as an offset to the rate impact as I highlighted. So those were – there were some offsets that, which we're always working obviously to drive in this lower rates environment. There were some offsets that had us outperform in the quarter. So I mean, the guidance I gave for 4Q is how we see it at the moment, largely driven by the impact of rates. But of course, we're going to always look to drive offsets where we can. In terms of the IB, you know, I'd say, you know, the – on the Markets side, I mean it's effectively the you know, the Credit Suisse team has been embedded for some time. The positions have been all largely transitioned over. So it's you know, it's all steam and full steam ahead in terms of that. Credit Suisse is supporting Markets on the research side but yeah, it's the performance I would say, is not about it being a lower base. I think in Markets it's been about a team that's – a strong team that's gotten stronger and you see in supportive markets how the team is performing.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Thank you. Piers Brown, HSBC Good morning, guys. Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third – in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Hi, Piers. So on the second look, you know, Sergio and I have said consistently that in NCL we're going to prioritize cost takeout in the way we think about de-risking the book. That still is the team's focus. You know, it's had a great run and continued to do so in 3Q with de-risking another 5 billion of RWA, you know, so I mean, I wouldn't necessarily draw conclusions other than to say that the pace that they were running at is a pace that would be very hard to sustain, given that we had, you know, we articulated ambitions for the end of 2026 that they've been making quick work at. But – and we'll come back and re-guide as I mentioned in my comments in 4Q about how we see the next two years. But certainly you, you can't draw a straight line from the performance that they've had, you know, live-to-date. In terms of the Banking performance in the quarter. Look, I still think it was a good performance. It outperformed the fee pool. We had a very strong first half of the year. 2Q was exceptionally strong. We had a bit of bring forward as well of some deals that we were able to get done in 2Q. And probably had the inverse dynamic happening in 3Q, where we had some deals, you know, pushed into the fourth quarter and those deals on the margin can make a difference on the performance in the comparative. But we remain very, very bullish on the pipeline. You know, naturally, of course, the uncertainties that we highlighted in our comments about 4Q, you know, are clearly potential issues to navigate, i.e. the US elections, other geopolitical concerns and tensions that may impact on banking overall. But I think, you know, we're going to continue to gain market share. And, you know, we're bullish on Banking's ability to execute on its pipeline.",30 October 2024,3Q24,3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Todd, I would only maybe add to that. From a comparison standpoint of view, it's worthwhile to note that strategically we are underweight in debt capital markets. So, in a sense, when you look at the performance, you have to look at the third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for debt capital markets. So I think that we are very happy with the developments that we've seen in Banking and the ability to win mandates. Now, of course, we need to see if we can execute it if the market will – if the market will be there, but just very, very confident that it's a good momentum. So that was the last question so thanks for dialing in and for your questions and we'll catch up in February for the Q4 results, and we're going to give you also an update on our 2025 and 2026 journey. Thank you.

While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, the global economy may be negatively affected by shifting political circumstances, including as a result of elections, increased tension between world powers, growing conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will further widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including elevated inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors;

Unknown,,"Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. First of all, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the slides, I can put together a revenue picture as you're giving some details around return on risk-weighted assets in the long term, as well as your risk- weighted assets overall absolute. So, I get to about $48.5 billion of revenues, which implies around 70% cost income of $34 billion. And clearly, first of all, I wanted to see if the revenue assumption that I'm making here calculation is reasonable and what underlying scenarios you use to calculate that. And secondly, on the cost side, clearly, even if I assume some kind of growth rate in kind of cost inflation, I still see that most of the cost savings come from your legacy non-core reductions. So, it looks like a lot of flexibility. So, can you talk a little bit about – is my calculation correct to some extent? And secondly, how should I think about the cost flexibility as it seems to mainly come from Non-core and Legacy? That's the first question. If I may, just secondly, on the Investment Bank. You're clearly making a big investment push, and here I want to understand at what point do you see delivery has to be achieved. I think you mentioned end-2026 in terms of revenue improvement, but is there any milestones that have to be achieved order to illustrate that this cost income will continuously improve not just in the first quarter?",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Thanks for your questions. Let me take the first. So, I think in terms of the way you're thinking about it, I'd say the key is to think about a cost income ratio below 70% is really the driver as we exit 2026. You know, the revenue picture that we gave, as I commented, is not based on blue sky scenarios. You see that for two of the core business divisions, we effectively priced in, you know, flat revenue growth. NCL, we priced in flat revenue growth. We talked quite, you know, I think appropriately about what we would expect from GWM as it improves its asset base. And of course, on the IB, coming from a low 2023 and given the onboarding of the Credit Suisse bankers we discussed and getting them productive over the next 12 to 18 months, one could see that our revenue picture is, you know, is appropriate in that respect and not toppy. That said, you know, when you look at, say, the return on RWA, which is I think what you used as a basis, you know, that is certainly our ambition is to do the financial resource optimization to improve our – the ratio of revenues over RWA, and that's clearly something we know we need to do. You saw in the depiction of how dilutive the CS revenues have been on that metric. So clearly, we're going to keep working on that. But the key really to take away here is that, you know, as both Sergio and I said, we have the flexibility to, you know, pace the reinvestments of the $13 billion in gross cost saves depending on how that revenue trajectory develops. So, for us, that's really the key, maintaining less than a 70% cost income ratio. That's where the discipline comes in and as I said, pricing in what is an appropriate revenue picture and just ensuring we keep to the gross cost saves and then we could pace the reinvestment as appropriate.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Kian, vis-a-vis your second question on the IB, I think of course we do expect the onboarded resources, particularly in the banking part of the business, to start to ramp-up to average productivity of the incumbent UBS bankers. And that will happen and is already happening, to be honest, because we have been observing good mandates winning. Of course, now what we need is the second condition how do I – first one is do we win mandates? Do we get tractions? And the answer is clearly yes. So, I'm very pleased with that outcome. Now, the most difficult question to answer is, is the market going to be there to support monetizing those mandates? And you know what's going on. It's very difficult to predict the near future. So, past a very, very hard 2023 but the momentum is very good. So, I do think that is important to measure that. The other observation I tried to take on executed transaction will be are we gaining market shares? How do we do relatively to our competitors? A third element which is very important for me, how is the IB contributing to the value creation in our Wealth Management and P&C businesses because it is very, very important, is a pillar, is a very important driver and particularly now in the US but also for example in Australia, but also in APAC, in general. We can drive this real value creation by working closer together. But lastly, it will be over the cycle, can they deliver return on allocated equity, as we've said, as a target? So, it's a set of short-term and medium-term and long-term measures that we will use, but I'm confident that the trajectory we had in the last seven, eight years, which has volatility elements, will continue but in a way that accrue value to our shareholders and clients. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs," Thanks. So, first, on slide 28. If I zoom in on 2026, you've guided to an exit run rates of 15% return on core Tier 1. But for the year as a whole, you flagged double digit, which I guess is sort of 10% to 12%. So, just wondering if there's something specific happening later towards the end of 2026 that's causing a sort of big jump up in profitability or perhaps whether I'm just being a bit too pessimistic on assuming that double digit means 10% to 12%? And then second, on distribution. We have the details in terms of what you want to do on the dividend this year, also the comments you've made on buybacks for 2024 and for 2025, but I was just thinking about how you think about the overall payout ratio longer term, 2026 onwards, and the split in that between dividends and buybacks.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Chris. So, on the first, I think what's that dynamic is effectively the benefit of having the full year of 2026 absorb all the savings that, you know, we're working super hard at to achieve over the next two to three years. So, during the course of 2026, we're still going to be taking significant cost out. In particular, the expectation is more in the middle and back office where, as I mentioned, you know, things are sequenced a bit. You know, we have to get the client tech decommissioning done and you'll start to see sort of a lot of the middle and back office functions, including semi-owned, where we'll see more of the cost take-out in the latter part of the journey. And so, what you're seeing really priced in at the end of 226 is the full harvesting, effectively the complete cost income story whereas in 2026 in-year, of course, you know, you're just having the averaging effect over the course of the year.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yes, Chris. On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas Exane,"Thank you. And apologies, my video is not working actually so I'm audio only. So, sorry for that. Two questions if I could. So, I think what you said about RWA reductions is very welcome, you know, and the target of $510 billion in the medium term and that frees up a lot of capital, which is really great to hear. You've talked about optimization outside Non-core, so within the core divisions, and I just wonder if you could sort of talk about that a bit more. Just give us some examples of the kind of lazy assets that you think you can cut. So, that's my first question. The second one is back on the capital returns. You talked about 2024 and you talked about 2026 on the buybacks and I just wondered in terms of how we think about what you might be able to do in 2025. Is 14% CET1 the relative – the relevant thresholds? Are there other constraints that will constrain you in terms of what buybacks you can do in 2025? So, does it have to wait for the Swiss integrations to be done? Does it have to wait for non-core milestones? If you just could talk about the constraints that would affect that, that would be great.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Okay. Hi, Jeremy. So, on the first in terms of RWA reduction, you were looking for examples in terms of optimization in the core. So, I'd say, you know, the classic example would be where on, say, on the Credit Suisse side. In Wealth Management, to give an example, we are inheriting a situation where there was just say a loan relationship between the bank and a client. And perhaps, you know, we weren't bringing to bear the holistic client array of services that is our expectation to sort of do. Now, it's been the blueprint for us in UBS. GWM. And so, that's just an example where you have kind of a monoline is a simple example of that. Another example could be pricing. So, you might not be getting the pricing for the risks that you're effectively taking with respect to that financing. So, I think those are two examples where, you know, we need to do work to ensure the holistic client coverage is brought to bear in a given situation or we're looking at pricing opportunities in particular cases.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah, Jeremy, in respect of share buyback in 2025, I think it's a little bit early to discuss that. But I would say that first of all, the integration, the Swiss topic, is a 2024 matter. So, by mid-2024 or during 2024 latest, we know exactly how we manage the integration of the parent company, the US entities and the Swiss operation. That will so in 2025 is unlikely to play a role in our capital return policies. The 14% is a good assumption. And what we mean by around 14% means 13.8% to 14.2%, not 14.5%. When we have excess capital, well above the 14% is because we are creating the buffer to do share buyback, to offset temporary timing differences between cost to achieve in our integration journey and the savings we realize and have the necessary buffer to also phase in the reduction of our tax rate. So, in a sense, nothing really changes but we do indeed expect also the underlying profitability to improve, and therefore potentially giving us more flexibility. But this is something that we will focus in exactly 12 months' time and we will communicate our plans for 2025.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas Exane,That's great. Thanks very much.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we’re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"So, I'll let Todd take the questions and only noting that you may have got the revenues wrong, but you may address this issue.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Okay. Yes. So, Andy, hey. I will just go on the cost side because I think I addressed the revenue side anyway in response to Kian. I would – I'd also – it's also important to point out just quickly on that slide that as we say in there, it's pre-impact from the Basel III final and model update so that, you know, also will impact on the return of RWA. In terms of the additional cost opportunities that we found, as you asked, I mean, first, I would say we're just confirming what we said last year about greater than $10 billion and saying we had to go do the work to validate all the details. And so, you know, the $13 billion that we've come out with, neither Sergio nor I think that that's, you know, going further. It was for us always the neighborhood of where, you know, we thought the plan – the detailed bottom-up plans would get us. And ultimately, when we were communicating greater than $10 billion, you know, that was an informed estimate of course because we had done a fair bit of work. But of course, all the work that we've done over the last three months validating that, you know, that number. So, that's sort of the first thing is just important to emphasize that it's not as if we've gone deeper. But in terms – so on that basis, I would just say that the $13 billion remains for us on a gross basis, critical. You know, we said half is going to be personnel related. Half is – the other half will be consisting comprised of things like mainly tech but also real estate, also third party costs. So, again, it's a validation of what we've done and also as I highlighted going through the trajectories, giving you a sense of when we think these will head through. And just quickly on the – you asked about, you know, sacrificing topline growth. I think the point that both Sergio and I have made is just of course when you do a financial resource optimization work, and we've done this before, you know, naturally to reduce the balance sheet means at times, well, you know, you're going to be sacrificing revenues as assets come down. And so, you know, it all comes down to the accretion of return on CET1 ultimately and how we think about this in terms of trade-offs. So, that's how I would respond to that. And then I think you were saying any other differences, if I took your point on CET1 and tangible equity. Was that the point that you were making the differences, I think you were saying, Andy.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yes. Well, I was just pointing out in terms of convergence, as I highlighted, you know, historically one of the big differentiators between CET1, which we think, by the way, is the right is the right model anyway because that's the basis for being able to buy back shares and pay dividends, so we think, you know, measuring return on CET1 capital is right. But we know there's always interest in that CET1 versus TE. So, what I was just suggesting was that our – as our tax loss DTAs, which were one of the big differentiators, are amortizing down and being converted into temp difference DTAs which are CET1 accretive, that that becomes much less of a delta and therefore, you know, signals a move towards convergence.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah, Maybe let me just add quickly to your comment on driving optimization of the balance sheet and return on risk-weighted assets. You mentioned if we are planning to exit products, I have to say that, you know, never say never because in the next two or three years, you never know how developments work out. But at this stage, everything that we don’t deem as a product that we want to have is part of non-core. So, it's all about repricing the existing core relationships and businesses. It's not about exiting businesses. I mean, I'm talking about meaningful businesses, of course, right? So, I don't expect – it's really and that's the reason why it's not an immediate effect because we have to manage the relationship. We have to manage the discussion with clients in a way that they understand risk-reward for us, for them. They understand the value of the advice we give to clients, the services and products we give. We also have to make sure that, you know, where applicable, we stop having discounts. And so, this is over time, of course, is going to help to close the gap.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Well, it would be $510 billion times the 9% since that would be the return inclusive of the – so that's apples and apples.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Coombs,Citigroup,"Brilliant. Thank you. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah. Sorry. Hopefully that works. If you can talk about the path from the 15% to the 18% in 2028 return on core Tier 1 capital. Given you had 15% to 18% before, so how conservative is the timing as well as the 18% compared to your previous range and how much is at self-help versus market? And the second question is a Q4 question. Your net fee generating assets were negative in Q4. If you can maybe elaborate a bit on what's been driving this? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Anke, I'll take this one. I think – and you take the second, Todd. I guess on the exit rate, we are trying to model what the potential will be and I outline that we can definitely converge back into a level of value creation that is in the middle range since maybe it's also appropriate to remember that if we wanted to really reiterate the old story, we would have talked about 15% to 18%. and what we are saying is that we believe the exit rate is 18%. So, I believe that the combined story over time will deliver a better, more stable, less volatile returns and those returns will be in the mid of that range between, you know, from above 15%, around 18%. So, I would say that's the nuances of the changes are the one I just mentioned. So, we are not talking about 15% to 18%. I believe that we are well-positioned to be sustainably in the high teens going forward. I don't think there is a level of being conservative five years ahead. We need to really work out the execution of the phase and understand what is the potential, and over time we will fine tune short-term ambitions.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Anke, on the net new fee generating assets in the quarters, you mentioned they were negative. Just to unpack that a bit. We saw good NNFGA on the UBS platform. What you see a bit is more the Credit Suisse dynamic in terms of mandates on the Credit Suisse platform and in the fact that there was a net outflow of mandates that also could be as well from relationship managers who have left. We are countering that by virtue of having now have an aligned CIO view and aligned solutions and offerings that we're bringing out to both – on both platforms. So, we expect going forward that, you know, the CS mandates that perhaps we were seeing a bit less of than ideal. We should be able to stem that issue a bit going forward from an NNFGA perspective. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Alastair Ryan,Bank of America,"Yeah. Okay. Apologies. Technology is not my specialty. $100 billion net new assets in 2024 and 2025 but that feels like about dividends and interest given the shape of the balance sheet you provide in the slides. So, could you just talk – just expand a little bit on what else the underlying outflows assumptions you're making perhaps on some of the relationships you took over with Credit Suisse whether that's case? And secondly, cash, now 18% of the balance sheet. Very, very high liquidity coverage ratio. Is that something that's just the new run rate or can you bring that down as you complete the complex legal entity restructuring? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Alastair, I'll take those. So, on your first on net new assets, you know, the $100 billion over the next two years just reflects the fact that, you know, to the point that I think we've been making that while we're going to continue to grow the asset base, I mean, $100 billion is still $100 billion over the next – each of the next two years, $200 billion by the end of 2025 and that's a focus of the team. In terms of where we think, you know, the appropriate ambition would be, normally when we're just in growth – full growth mode and not looking to also ensure that, you know, appropriate hygiene on the balance sheet, that's reflecting that discount in there a bit. We still think it's a strong number. It's still growing the asset base. It's still providing a basis to grow our revenues, as I highlighted in my comments, but it is reflecting the fact that in addition to growing client relationships and bringing more and more aligned products and solutions to our clients, there are going to be situations, as we both highlighted, where, you know, perhaps we see potential outflows because of decisions we've made around given service for example, trying to a price alone, potentially unsuccessfully, and then seeing that roll off and then potentially the collateral moving out of the bank as a result. So, it's just appropriate to price in some of that as we do this, you know, good and necessary work to ensure ultimately stronger return on RWA and sustainably higher returns in the long run. In terms of cash or the HQLA that we have, yeah, you could assume going forward that that is structurally our run rate for now just given the new Swiss liquidity ordinance requirements that we're complying with. So, you can assume that that's right. Naturally, we're focusing on, you know, winning back deposits and continuing diversified sources of funding, not least given the structural funding gap we've inherited from the Credit Suisse subsidiary in Switzerland. So, you know, we're taking steps in our funding plan to narrow that. But in the end, you can assume that for now, that level of liquidity is sort of run rate level.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Hi. Good morning. You hear me well? Okay, perfect. So, my first question goes to GWM Americas. I think the target is low teens until 2026 and then up to mid-teens PBT margin. So, what strategic options are you taking to structurally lift profitability in this division? I think I heard this – rebuilding the banking platform in-house, but if you can give us more color on that. So that's my first longer-term question. Whereas on the short term, in terms of transaction margins, those are being subdued for a while and especially in Asia. What evidence are you seeing or are you seeing any evidence of that coming back? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Hi, Giulia. So, on – in terms of the sorts of investments we're making, as you mentioned, you know, we think the core banking infrastructure work is critical because that effectively institutionalizes clients much more effectively in doing that. The more that you have a broader suite of products and capabilities to offer clients, the more in effect it becomes, you know, they become stickier. The clients and the advisors just become stickier. We know that playbook. We run that playbook in every part of the world outside the US. And so, it's something that for us is quite fundamental. And so, we're going to continue to do that and continue to invest in digital capabilities to make being both a client and an advisor of the US business of GWM better. There are also some other things that we're doing to bring that profit margin up. Sergio mentioned in his comments. A lot of it's also about products and capabilities and we're seeing that start to hit through. And that's just in terms of, again, borrowing a page from the playbook that we use outside the US, it's the global markets approach. So, it's having a more joint GWM-Investment Bank approach to serving clients from a transactional perspective, especially clients with more sophisticated needs, also from a lending perspective as well, having more of a focus on lending solutions as we've done outside the US as well. So, I think doing all that is where we think, you know, just doing the sort of good blocking and tackling will, you know, should support the profit margin in mid-teens over the next two to three years. In terms of transaction margins in APAC, yeah, I think we are seeing – we actually saw some good performance in the fourth quarter from a TRX perspective, in particular on the UBS platform, which is encouraging. So, we're – and also in APAC. Again, given just our diversification in the region, we're not just limited to, you know, one location potentially underperforming from an equity markets perspective, and we actually saw a good performance in the region. In particular, we saw good performance in transactions in Japan this quarter. And so, you know, we have the good, diversified approach to ensure that even if one – as I said, one particular part of the region isn't generating the sorts of margins that are ideal for us that we're able to compensate.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Thanks.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous,"Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the presentation and for taking my questions. I hope you can hear me well. I wanted to first ask on the share buyback restart this year. I was a bit surprised that you make this link between the legal entity merger of the parent banks and the ability to restart the share buyback. Do you see actually a direct link there between Group payout capacity and what happens to the parent bank merger or is it just a short form for you to say if the merger works, that's a good indication that the integration is online, and that's why I can go back to share buybacks? And the second question is on capital requirements. You have obviously presented the plan very much on the basis of the rules as they currently stand, but we also have an upcoming review by the government and we don't know how that looks like. On a confidence scale of 1 to 10, where do you think the outcome will be? Do you think your numbers will still be proven fine after this review or do you think it could change? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Stefan. I think the link between share buyback and the parent bank merger and the underlying US operation and later on, the Swiss one, it's very relevant because if we have a delay, our ability to start to deliver on the cost synergies will come just later. And therefore, we would lose capital buffers that we believe is necessary. So, I think it's totally there is no gaming or nothing. It's just prudent reasonable way to look at the two major risks associated with such an integration is regulatory approvals to execute legal entity mergers. We are talking about 50-plus countries. Okay? And the second one is IT migration. This is probably more the 2024 into 2025 as we start to migrate. So, if we don't get into a good place with our parent company merger by the end of the second quarter, we have a delayed effect which has to be reflected in our prudence in terms of how we accrue capital. So, I hope this is very clear now. In terms of capital requirements, yeah, well, I mean, I can only say, you know, watch and listen to what has been said publicly by different international and domestic experts around the topic of capital and why Credit Suisse failed. Credit Suisse didn't fail because of lack of capital or lack of liquidity per se but it failed because, you know, partially, I would say the loss of trust and confidence, the lack of underlying profitability and that created a self-fulfilling problem. I think if you look at regulation, you know, the regulation was well applied and fully functioning for UBS. So, the same regulation should have worked for Credit Suisse. I do think that – I'm pretty convinced that any authorities and governments, before taking actions on capital, they will also have to sit down and look at what happened, like the commission that is investigating on the matter is doing, and everybody will have to pose and think about what they could have done better, being a little bit more self-critical about what happened. So, I believe the current regime and no experts is saying that more capital is necessary. So, I'm not going to give you an answer on my rating of confidence because there is only downside on that, but I can only tell you that facts are telling us a crystal clear story that capital is not the way to manage such a situation.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous,Very clear. Thank you very much.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,"Morning. Thank you for the questions. I've got three on capital, one of which is a clarification. I wanted to dig into slide 36, the $15 billion of balance sheet optimization. Clearly, it's talking about net of gross as well. So, can we get a feeling for what the underlying moving parts are because it's clearly going in different directions and whether there's any kind of regulatory securitization type benefit to think about, say non-revenue costing RWA efficiencies to think about on the forward look. And then linked to that, clearly the lower RWA outlook has created lots of flexibility in your plan, but how do you guys think about redeploying your balance sheet if there are profitable growth opportunities particularly given that your stock is trading above tangible book or CET1? And then just a clarification. On the AT1 buildout, it says increasing to 18% by 2029 but I think you referenced 2026 as well in terms of that Tier 1 capital requirement. So, if you just give us color on the AT1 buildout timeline would be very helpful. Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So, let me – thanks for that, Adam. Let me just cover. The last one is 2029 because that's, you know, that is how we've modeled and also just given the way our expectations are on the Too Big To Fail requirements coming in impacting on going concern capital out until 2030. So, that is the correct read. In terms of the first question on slide 36, so the $510 billion effectively where we think we get to, of course, is net of growth. So, there is a growth that is priced in. So, the fact that we have, say, balance sheet optimization in the core businesses, we say net of growth. So, these are trade-offs that we're making and look, we've done this before and it's, you know, taking the balance sheet in areas where there are opportunities to generate greater returns on RWA. That's the work that we're doing, and obviously where there are opportunities to grow especially to start to begin to harvest the combination and the scale that we have. Clearly, that will be the case.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Yeah, I guess a 5% return on risk-weighted assets is not acceptable, right? So, I think that's the reason I'm saying it makes no sense for us to try to overly impress anybody with growth on the top line if this is just destroying value or not sustainable. So, we are willing to take a step back in terms of growth. But still in some areas, are we going to grow? Now, It's very important to understand the restructuring element up until the end of 2026. Afterwards, we will grow. Of course, we will grow. So, we are not a restructuring story. We will grow again because our business will grow but from a base that I believe is going to be much more reliable and sustainable.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Could I have a follow-up in terms of what volume of RWA are sitting below kind of your aspiration in terms of RoRWA? Just trying to size the opportunity in terms of recycling your risk weights into high growth.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Well, you look at the balance sheet of Credit Suisse that we onboarded has revenues on risk-weighted assets of 5% on average in 2022. Now, we are already taking actions but this is the volume you have to think about. So, we were perfectly happy with the return profiles of our Wealth Management and IB and Swiss bank operation. So, we need to now bring it back. And I think it is very important that, you know, it's all about giving clear directions to our people. Our new colleagues from Credit Suisse fully understand that they are now following what they believe also is the best way to create value for clients – for shareholders, but also for clients because we want to be predictable. We want to be a partner that is there and where the relationship allows us to tell what are our expectations and what is the client expectations, and that we'll need to be addressed and we now have a clear, aligned way of looking at how to develop and grow the business.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Adam Terelak,Mediobanca,Right. Thank you very much.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on Investment Bank. If you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to $200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of risk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified platform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse bankers you onboarded, pretty low revenues so far. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the markets position that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse colleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they could see an acceleration this year. Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Ben. So, in terms of the run rate of net new assets from $100 billion, I would say as Sergio just highlighted in response to the last question, you know, we for sure will grow. And once we feel like the balance sheet is in a better spot, we think that that will build quickly in terms of, you know, us focusing on growth. So, the bridge to $200 billion, while we're not disclosing specifically what we think the numbers are, you can expect that, you know, certainly in 2026 we should start to see that come up pretty significantly and then build to $200 billion by 2028. So, I would say it's not necessarily just, you know, linear straight line. We should see a bit of an acceleration early on in 2026, but I think there's some hard yards that we have modeled in to get to the $200 billion in the latter part of that five-year cycle. In terms of IB productivity on the markets side, I mean, one of the key points that I highlighted was, you know, actually onboarding on the markets side, fully onboarding not only the traders but their positions, which is now – it's been 4Q but really it's an intense piece of work in 1Q where we expect the majority of the positions to then be onboarded on UBS infrastructure. Once that happens, you know, we think that the markets personnel should be able to start generating, you know, appropriate revenues. Yes, there's a ramp, but it's not the same as in on the banking side where that productivity is going to take a longer ramp as you might appreciate it, but we should see and we expect that we'll see better productivity pretty quickly once the positions are onboarded on to the UBS infrastructure.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Benjamin Goy,Deutsche Bank,Understood. Thank you.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallett,KBW," Morning. Yeah. Hi, guys. So, most of my questions have been answered, but just maybe going back to NII. You say it will grow again in the second half of the planning period. Am I right in just assuming that's the second half of 2025? So, i.e. kind of NII should decline three to early 2025? And then secondly, you know, one of your peers in the US said that deposit mix changes were kind of ending. Is that what you're seeing as well? And could you maybe just clarify the wider international business, what's going on with deposit mix changes there or what you expect going forward? Thanks.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Sure. Hey, Tom. So, in terms of NII, yeah, we see the recovery coming from more mid 2025. So that's correct, that's the right read. So, you know, again, just given how we're pricing in rate reductions, you know, whether they come, I think as you know the different views. But whether they come over 12 months or 18 months, we're running our models, but we definitely have rate reductions before we see stability, you know, into 2025 for sure. And then that stability then corresponds as well with what we think would be a pick-up in loan volumes and loan revenues overall on top of, of course, the funding efficiencies that I talked about at length during my comments that really start to accelerate the recovery in NII in the latter part of the or the second half effectively of the three-year planning cycle. In terms of deposit mix effects, absolutely. We've seen a tapering in the US. We started seeing even last quarter, even in 3Q, we're seeing that continue to taper. Still seeing a little bit of that, though, where there's spillover and higher rates in some of the non-US dollar currencies in particular in Switzerland. So, we're still seeing a bit of deposit mix shifts, but we sort of price them more or less out of our outlook, you know, once we get beyond 1Q. And in terms of how that looks across I think the US, we're now – we've seen stability first time since 4Q 2021 that we've had net deposit inflows so that's good. In APAC, we've actually seen some good deposit inflows also not least just given win-back. So, there's that impact as well. And in Switzerland, we're seeing a bit of a slightly downward move in terms of deposit inflows. So, just to give you a sense of sort of the deposit volume as I see it across the spectrum.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Tom Hallett,KBW,That's very clear. Thank you.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Génerale,"Fantastic. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, on capital. I'm really trying to square your RWA guidance with how you feel about buybacks. So, looking at that equation, you know, that $510 billion on RWAs, obviously quite low versus consensus. But if you take consensus capital of, say, $80 billion, $81 billion, then you are looking at about 15.8% CET1 ratio. So, we even get to the conclusion that your buyback potential is quite a lot higher than what you've indicated or maybe your expectation for CET1 capital is maybe materially lower than $81 billion. So, I just wanted to see how you feel about that. And then the second question is on the NII guidance that you've given. Obviously, we've drill down into the deposit mix shift there. But you’ve noted that one of your competitors are also one of the big drivers there has been deleveraging of Lombard loans and I wanted to see if that was actually a big driver for yourselves as well and how this has impacted your thoughts on NII for this year and going forward?",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that, Andrew. So, I'll take – on the second one, no, we're not seeing – I mean, we've had some deleveraging that we've highlighted in prior quarters but we're not seeing that as a major factor in our guidance at this point other than around the impacts from the resource optimization that I've highlighted. But in particular around Lombard deleveraging, we're not pricing that to any significant degree into our guidance. And I was just trying to pick up on your first point where you were, sorry, you were trying to square if – where the RWA levels are in terms of how that informs the way you want to think about share buybacks? I just want to understand your point if you can repeat them.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale," Yes. So, let’s say we’re taking that consensus of $81 billion CET1 capital, you’ve indicated $510 billion on RWA. So, that would be 15.9% CET1 ratio. So, actually it is quite a lot of buffer, maybe $5 billion or so above $5.5 billion buybacks that you might be pointing towards for 2026. So, you know, there’s either a lot more capacity for you to actually push up your buybacks there or maybe you’re thinking that CET1 capital might be a bit lower than what consensus think. So, I just want to see what you think about it.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah, I think – okay. Clear. So, yeah, I think in terms of your CET1 capital calculations, I'm not sure that squares with how we model under one baseline scenario. But I think it's fair to say that, you know, if we generate as we go out to 2026, the extent to which we're able to generate the returns that we expect to generate at the end of 2026, that there will be sufficient capacity, as Sergio said, to be able to undertake as much share buybacks as we had, in fact, more so than pre-acquisition levels. So, I think, you know, I won't comment specifically on whether your CET1 number is the same number we consider under one scenario but I think it's fair to say that there is share buyback capacity naturally if we hit these targets that we've set out.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Andrew Lim,Société Générale, Great. Thanks.,6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Nicolas Payen,Kepler Chevreux,"Yes. Morning. I have two questions, please. Two on Wealth Management. The first one would be on your pre-tax profit margin targets in the US. You're targeting mid-teens by 2026 and still significantly below what your US peers are doing. So, I wanted to know what kind of levers you can pull through to have this convergence towards the profitability levels that we are seeing of the US peers. And the second one will be on the net inflow that you are targeting. Is there any geographies where you see the most potential or where you are the most excited about where you – where the CS merger is bringing new capabilities and new outlook? Thank you.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the – look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we’re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Nicolas Payen,Kepler Chevreux,"Thank you. Piers Brown, HSBC Yeah. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a final one on litigation. Just whether there's anything in the plan for a sort of a business as usual normalized charge for litigation. I know you've taken a lot of adjustments on CS acquisition and you've gotten the $4 billion of balance sheet reserves at this stage, but having had a good chance to look at the case book at this point. Is there anything in there which you think might still burden the P&L over the course of the targets that you’ve laid out this morning? Thanks.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hey, Piers. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I mean, just refer you to the litigation note which, you know, gives both the UBS heritage and Credit Suisse heritage legacies there, say that's the best bet. Otherwise, I’ll just tell you that our provision levels are augmented by the PPA that I described in August. We're comfortable with the levels we're at just given the – where those matters sit, but that's, you know, all I would comment in terms of litigation at this stage.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements This transcript contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the Risk Factors filed on Form 6-K with the 2Q23 UBS Group AG report on 31 August 2023 and the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.",6 February 2024,4Q23,4q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Yeah. Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Let me pick up the second question and then I'll pass it to Todd. So, I think in terms of, you know, the caveating on our capital returns is quite consistent with previous language. You know, being, you know, staying at 14%, delivering on our financial plans, but also reducing the risk of the execution of the integration. So in that sense, you know, I just want to remind that the massive migration of data we're going to go through in 2025 creates potential operational risk. So we have to be prudent about how we also look at share buybacks. Having said that, I'm still confident that we will be able to do that. Now, you know, I have no more visibility than you have in respect of how things are going to develop other than what is publicly presented. I have, you know, I can continue to say that it is for us not appropriate to speculate on any outcome. And, you know, so we will engage till the last minutes to make sure that whatever proposal is put on the place is reflecting of the concerns and topics that I raised in my remarks.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," And Chris, on the first one, just to point out a few things that no, it's not – the change is not reflective of what we consider to be more, more complex versus less complex. Important to note that, you know, when we developed this view a year back, this was seen as a very low multiplier when you look at 13 billion of cost to achieve versus the gross cost saves that we anticipated. And we're still even with 14 billion at a very low multiplier. And so it should be seen in that light, but it's important to highlight that the changes were invited by certain assumptions we modeled a year ago and we saw changes which I highlighted in my comments earlier. But also importantly, we've identified incremental opportunities as we've worked through the integration to unlock additional shareholder value, and that's taken some incremental cost to achieve that.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Chris Hallam,Goldman Sachs,"Okay. Thanks very much. Anke Reingen, RBC Sorry. Yeah. Thank you much for taking my question. Two questions, please. On the first one coming back to the too big to fail was, I mean, you stressed a few times the potential impact on your return currently, on your current assumptions based on 14%. I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but do you think considering depending on the outcome, you will have room to offset your ROE dilution for more capital requirements? And then thank you on the US wealth management operation, a few details here. I'm just wondering obviously you talked about improving the performance of the US operations a few times before. So what will be different this time that this will work out? Thank you very much.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Anke. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, there is no easy fixes and there is no potential offset on the table that is not already planned and communicated. So no easy fixes, no low hanging fruits. Whatever comes is on top of our plans, and it will be dilutive. Todd?",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Anke. You know, look, in terms of what's different, we wanted to highlight the things that we're doing now and demonstrate the initiatives we're undertaking and the plans that we have that will help us chip away. You know, we're being realistic in terms of what we think the margins can be over the mid-term, and we have a very comprehensive way at that. There is no silver bullet where there's one thing where you say that's going to effectively transform the pre-tax margin. But what I think you heard me say, and Sergio alluded to in his opening, is that we're very focused to actually across these various levers. We're implementing them all. And they're, you know, in the collective, we're going to contribute to improving the efficiency of the business. So I'd say that's our focus and that's where we look, that's the outcome we're looking to drive. Anke Reingen, RBC Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Yeah. Morning. Thank you. Two questions, please. Firstly, just to sort of revenue in the quarter, the capital markets growth. So ECM and DCM was a bit less than some of the peer groups, 11% year-on-year. I just wondered if there's any mix reasons for that or if there's any sort of delay still in Credit Suisse teams becoming fully productive. So just a question on capital markets revenues. And then second question is on the foreign subsidiaries topic. It sounds like you've reduced the UBS Americas CET1 ratio to around 20% from the previous 27%. In the past, you've run that anywhere from 14% to 22%. Is it realistic to think about going back into the mid to high teens in that subsidiary on a, say, five-year view?",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Jeremy. Just on the second one. So we are targeting and as you acknowledge from the capital repatriation, the CET1, capital in the IHC has come down significantly. We are targeting a lower CET1 capital ratio, say, in the upper teens level, but on a like-for-like basis under the Swiss standards, that's more in line with the 13% to 15% CET1 capital ratio. So that addresses that. On the IB question, I'll – just to point out on DCM, clearly, we're underweight versus peers. So you're seeing that manifest in the, in our performance. In ECM, as I highlighted, you know, we're building, but the timing of our pipeline build is likely to yield more payback later in 2025 into 2026.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Jeremy Sigee,BNP Paribas,"Okay. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Yes, thanks for taking my question. I really only have question regarding the key slide 32. Sergio, I get the message: don't get overexcited in terms of how capital would be repatriated and solve potentially a capital issue. But if I look at slide 32 and I got very excited when I saw the 13 billion, but clearly, it hasn't ended up in the parent bank. It has been further upstreamed. It looks like it. And I'm just trying to understand the rationale of the upstream and also trying to understand if there's room to downstream again, if necessary. And in that context and also trying to understand how much more capital is there in CS International? It should be something like 5 billion to 6 billion from what I calculate. And if there's any other subsidiaries that you would highlight, where there's room for potential further upstreaming into the parent going forward? So really just trying to square the process. I'm a little bit confused in that sense and if you could help me, I would really appreciate it.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,Well don’t tell me.,4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Kian, I think it's worth just pointing out that, remember, when we acquired Credit Suisse and the capital ratios at the parent bank were, you know, distressed relative to what the UBS AG's fully applied capital ratio was and the strength and resilience of our capital on the UBS side. Also to consider, you know, the equity double leverage that was there on the Credit Suisse side. And as we inherited that, the pressure it put, you know, on our own, just given what we had to address and pushing up that double leverage. So, you know, taking out the capital and rebalancing the capital from former Credit Suisse subsidiaries in, say, the UK and the US, you know, up to the parent and fundamentally at group level, as you say, has been part of the plan, but also helps to alleviate the pressure in the equity double leverage. And I think that's an important point to mention. And that's why we made the comment that, you know, if there's going to be onerous capital imposed on the parent bank, it's going to be funded with the retention of future profits. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan And just on double leverage, how much of the 13 billion do you actually require for double leverage and how much do you allocate for payback to shareholders? So we just get an idea how much is potentially excess in the holding, if there's any.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"It's a – look, of that amount that we have repatriated, there's a significant part of it that is used to support moving to a more normalized level of equity double leverage level, a significant portion of it. Thank you, Kian. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Thank you. Okay. And just on the 6 billion in the CS International, roughly 5 to 6 billion, is that correct, that's what's remaining?",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yes, I highlighted that in my comments as well that that's what we see. You know, naturally, it's a function of timing and ensuring that we continue to run down the positions in that entity and get the support from the regulator to repatriate the remaining capital in that entity as we transfer our positions, as I mentioned. And, you know, there could be leakage between now and then if we have losses in the entity. So, you know, conservatively, I mentioned around 5 billion that would come from CSI from here. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. Going back to slide 31 on the Non- core deleveraging, how is it possible that, if I exclude op risk, which I understand is driven by a formula, that's fine. But on credit and market risk, capital risk came down by 42 billion since Q2 2023, and now you only plan to cut 7 billion in 2025. Why wouldn't we expect a faster deleveraging there given the market is still very supportive? And then secondly, thanks for all the additional detail on the GWM in the US. On the NII discussion in that division, which I look forward to the disclosure in Q1 - I guess having operating under a national charter other than Utah would help. But how quickly do you expect to get that license, please? Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Giulia. So on the credit and market risk ambition in terms of the levels taking it down, you know, I think this goes really to the point I highlighted in my comments in the context of the underlying PBT we see in 2025 versus 2024. I made comments that, you know, the positions at this point are much smaller than we've seen. They're hedged at times. They could be – could have transfer restrictions associated with them. We have to ensure the counterparty is willing to terminate. There could be exotic security types with bespoke features that limit potential buyers. So there are a lot of issues as you get down into the portfolio and you have much smaller positions in these books, that's going to take, you know, extensive amount of work to see, you know, chip away at progress. So a lot of the, you know, the big rocks and larger positions that generated significant RWA reduction, but also invited an ability to exit at levels above book value, you know, we're going to become further and farther and less likely as we move forward. So I think it's just important to understand that in the context as well of the RWA rundown. In terms of your second question on the national charter and the timing, look, we're working on moving forward with getting the application in. There's a lot of work being done. And we're going to work as quickly as we can to get that rolled out and to enhance our banking product offering. I mean, we're not standing still at the moment. We're doing a lot of work in that respect now also to, you know, go live. But certainly, having that license will unlock certain product capabilities that just aren't possible until we have it.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,"Got it. But is it fair to expect that, you know, three years longer, shorter?",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Giulia, I think that's just something we'll continue to update you on. I don't want to predict the process because we're working obviously also with supervisors to get that, get the license approved. So the timeline is something we're working actively on, but we'll keep you updated.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Giulia Miotto,Morgan Stanley,Understood. Thank you.,4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,," And maybe just to add on, on Non-core, we always said that at the end of the day, of course, if we really want to take down market and credit risk overnight, we could probably find a price at which to do it. But now if that price is well in excess of our cost of capital and expected return, that would be a stupid trade. So we are constantly looking to optimize shareholder interest as we wind down this asset. So it doesn't really make sense to create new capital at a cost that is well above, how we expect to deliver in terms of returns.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research," Hi. Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the US wealth management plans, please. It looks like you're tilting away the business mix from the high end of the market towards more affluent and lower wealth brackets, which is pretty much the opposite of what you've been trying to achieve over the last 20 years, I would say. What has changed? Why are you coming to this different assessment of the relative attractiveness of different wealth brackets in the US? And the second question, I just wanted to make sure that I understood this correctly. The share buyback plans and aims that you outlined, they are not yet accrued and deducted from CET1 capital at the year end, isn't it? Thank you very much.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Hi, Stefan. The – yeah, with respect to the 2 billion [Edit: 3 billion] that we aim to buy back, you know, based on the conditionality that Sergio described, that is correct. On the US wealth side, I think it's just important to point out that it's not a shift in strategy. What we said was we're looking to rebalance more into the high net worth and affluent client segments. And the reality there is that one where we're quite overweight in ultra, which is, of course, you know, our strength. But it's also important to point out that the return on assets in that segment versus as you move down client segments is, of course, lower, and so the profitability as you move down segments is higher. And so what we're trying to do is rebalance so to stay obviously very, to stay very penetrated in ultra, but to increase our penetration in high net worth and affluent sort of to create a better balance in line, more in line with the market, a bit more in line, although of course, we want to stay more overweight at the top end because as I said, that's our strength and our what we bring to – the strength that we bring to the table. But it is really important to emphasize that, yes, that versus the market, you could see that as we have on and affluent where the profitability is improved. And yeah, the point is that...",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,Okay. Yeah. Just to quickly follow up on the first part of the question. Is the 1 billion share buyback plan also not deducted from CET1 capital or is it?,4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Good morning. One follow-up on GWM Americas and then perhaps I can touch on P&C, NII. On the GWM Americas, you highlighted a couple of times how you are adjusting the FA incentives to align them better with your strategic goals around net new money, sign acquisition and NII growth. I bet if you can just elaborate a bit more there on exactly what changes you are making, how you think those changes compare to your US peer group, especially given your comment in the near term it might lead some FA attrition and lower net new money? That's the first question. Second question on the P&C NII, it obviously has been of your biggest headwinds. You're guiding to, I think that was, well a much more pronounced drop this year than last year. But you're still expecting it to plateau after the second quarter. So if I just ask, what are your rate assumptions? Take the SNB rate. And I think you made a comment that it should plateau regardless of where the rate trajectory is thereafter. So perhaps if you could elaborate on that. And then also what your loan assumptions, given that your loan balances shrunk by another couple of billion this quarter. Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So first, on your first question in respect to the FA comp changes, you know, I think the changes that I highlighted that aligned better with our strategy also are more aligned to what we believe or observe are the comp models at our competitors as well. We had certain features we think that were perhaps off market and we are looking more to align with what our peers do. But I think the more important point though is that, you know, in discussing this with, you know, many financial and getting their take on these changes, it's clear that those who are very aligned with our strategy of bringing value to their clients and growing their books of business and, you know, as I said, bringing more solutions to their clients from essentially across what we can offer, those FAs will benefit in this model, and they'll get paid more. And I think that's the key point. My comment about FA attrition is just that those who may have benefited from features that we have eliminated may decide that it – that they would be better off trading away and we have to cater for that prospect in our in our modeling and so that's why I mentioned that. But, you know, it's important to keep in mind that the changes we're making are really not intended to reduce compensation, but to increase it as long as it's being done in ways that are very aligned with our strategy. And I think that's the most important point. On P&C, net interest income, you had several questions. I mean, in terms of rate assumptions, well, first of all, you know, the current rates are at 50 basis points, having come down 125 basis points over the last three quarters of 2024. There's an expectation, if you look at implied forwards, that the rate curve will approach near-zero. So there is really a lack of deposit margin room for maneuver as we look out, which is why, you know, we think that the full year 2025 NII, especially if rates move down further, will be even more pronounced than the Q1 guidance. I talked about plateauing, you know, once we inflect because if you look at the yield curve, it's actually quite flat if not even inverted, but it's certainly flat. And as such, you know, we don't see movements in it. So therefore, you know, if it's effectively hitting a trough, I see it plateauing. And then I commented that, which was your other question, you know, if rates move, obviously, if they move up, it gives us a bit more deposit margin room for maneuver. If they move down into negative territory, that is also helpful because we can typically charge certain clients and also drive greater lending NIM as well. As far as the expectation around loan balances, we have a stable outlook for lending in P&C and also a stable outlook for deposits in P&C. So we're quite focused continuing to do balance optimization, ensure that the pricing reflects the appropriate cost of risk and capital. And on the deposit side, we've been very thoughtful in how we have moved pricing down in relation to the central bank dropping rates in order to retain deposits where possible.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Stefan Stalmann,Autonomous Research,"Very helpful. Thank you very much. Amit Goel, Mediobanca Hi. Thank you and thank you for the clarifications on the capital. I've got just a couple of questions again on the US business. And so I guess, one, I was just wanted to understand a bit better, you know, as you get to the 15% PBT margin in 2027, you know, what is the kind of plan or thought process in terms of getting to kind of peer levels or 25%, 30% operating margin in the future or do you, I don't know if you think peers are overearning? But what the step is there? And if, you know, building out the more comprehensive banking offering and delivery model is part of that, but what cost is involved in that? And then secondly, also just curious, in terms of the PBT margin that you're targeting to sustain in 2027, I think previously you were talking about mid-teens in 2026. So just to check, is that slightly later or is it the same basic expectation? Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"Yeah. So in terms of the expectations, we haven't really articulated that other than I've said in the past that expected mid-teens in the midterm. We talked about the business and Sergio and I've been doing this. So I don't think it's inconsistent. But where we're talking over the next couple of years to continue to build and we think by 2027, we'll be at that at the mid-teens level. I mean, as far as comparing to peers and we don't – this isn't a comparison to peers for us or sorry, narrowing. It's not about effectively catching peers, but it's more about narrowing the gap. That's what we've said consistently, in order to, you know, to improve the overall cost-to-income ratio for the business overall. And in the US, to put us in a position where we're contributing significantly more to the overall profitability of Global Wealth Management. In terms of the banking capabilities and the other capabilities I talked about, those investments are catered for in my comments. I did say that we're making incremental technology investments and also investments in our capabilities and in the collective, you know, that's also being priced into our 2025 pre-tax margin expectation. But also as we, you know, as we guided looking out to 2027 as well. Amit Goel, Mediobanca Thank you. Can I just follow up just in terms of that investment and in terms of points of operating margin, would that be kind of 2, 3 or 5 percentage points of operating margin that you're investing in those years or just to think about thereafter, how much could potentially drop out or how much is just ongoing investment?",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"I'd just say the investments that we're making, we already – we've been investing in the business. So it's important to keep that in mind. But we are making, now we're ensuring that the investments that we make in technology are done in a way where the payback is improved, as I mentioned, improved ROI. We’re also funding incremental investments, as I say, and that is captured in the pre-tax margin expectation for 2025 and as we grow it. So, you know, I wouldn't model it falling out. I mean, this will be technology investments we're going to continue to make for the business to help it grow. Amit Goel, Mediobanca Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Antonio Reale,Bank of America,"Good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. Actually, it's two follow- ups, really. One on capital and one on the P&C. So you've repatriated the 13 billion capital at the parent company this quarter. And despite that, your CET1 ratio at the AG level was only up 20 bps or so Q-on-Q to 13.5% now. Could you please explain why that was the case and maybe talk us through the moving parts? I'm sorry if it's a repetition, but I think it's important. And the second question is, again, a follow-up on your Swiss business. You've talked about your NII guidance. Can you just remind us your sensitivity to rates and hedging structure in Switzerland? And more in general, what flexibility would you have to mitigate some of this trend on NII with the rest for the P&L? You've alluded to more cost synergies. So if you can share a little bit more about the moving parts of the P&L, that would be that would be super helpful. Thank you.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,,"So in terms of the mitigants a bit to the headwinds, you know, we're definitely focusing on driving as you saw in 4Q continuing to drive where possible, non-NII revenue growth improve on recurring revenue and P&C and also on transaction revenues. That will be a focus to partially offset the headwinds that we see in P&C. I mean as far as abilities to effectively hedge or extend duration, I mean that's just not when the rates are this low and with the flat yield curve, you know, extending duration, for example, on non-maturing deposits doesn't offer much of an advantage at all. In fact, it could lock in funding costs and rather than allow us to benefit from future rate cuts, including if they go below zero and also creates some mismatched risk, mismatch risk as well. So, you know, if the rates are going to near zero, as I said, we have very limited room for maneuverability, and we just have to wait until we see some daylight in terms of changes in that yield curve. On the capital question you had in terms of what you're missing, I think in terms of the CET1 capital ratio at UBS AG after it received the capital from the subsidiaries, you know, we are accruing a dividend to the parent to address the point that I made before in response to Kian's question. So it's a dividend accrual that will serve as an offset to the – sorry, dividend accrual to group. To be clear, to offset the capital repatriated to AG, its first tier subsidiary.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Antonio Reale,Bank of America,"Thank you very much. Piers Brown, HSBC Yes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow-ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the message correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep accounts and obviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, you're little bit below street expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just appetite for re-leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you comment that, please? And then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no change to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your favor on implementation of Basel III final that's caused a delta? Thanks.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Todd Tuckner,," Hi Piers, so on – I'll just take your second question first. So in terms of the Basel III, look, I guided down last quarter to a lower level than I had been guiding. You know, as we started to get more visibility and make progress, the team has done an excellent job at ensuring that we were able to mitigate where we can in some of the aspects that were at work or infrastructure improvements, model alignments, also exiting positions and running down risks. So all of those things contributed to our ability to be able to, you know, ultimately print the day-one level that's far inside where we had guided. In terms of re-leveraging opportunities, you know, for sure in Global Wealth Management with rates, you know, potentially higher, you know, we're not or not going, coming down as quickly as perhaps we anticipated a quarter ago or certainly two quarters ago. You know, that's going to be helpful. That's going to be helpful for deposit margins as I mentioned, but probably, we'll have a little bit of a chilling effect on re-leveraging, which is something that with rates coming down, we expect to see both in, you know, in all parts of the of the wealth business, which involves really where we have US dollar exposure in the US business naturally, but also in our APAC part of the business. And so we, you know, if rates sort of back up, then we'll have positive effects on deposit margins, but the extent of re-leveraging that we're pricing into the outlook, you know, we may see that come in less aggressively. Piers Brown, HSBC That's perfect. Thanks. Just on global banking, you mentioned a 20% change in pipeline, was it up or down? I didn't catch that.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf
Sergio P. Ermotti,,"What we mentioned, it's not our pipeline. What we said is that according to market data. So the industry is down 26% year-to-date [Edit: 21%], so for the first month.

But you know, if you look at according to market data, January, on January, you know, the amount of fees and activity is down 26% [Edit: 21%] if I remember correctly.",4 February 2025,4Q24,4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements”, including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, the global economy may be negatively affected by shifting political circumstances, including increased tension between world powers, terrorist activity, conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will further widen and intensify, may have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to continue through 2026 and presents significant operational and execution risks, including the risk that UBS may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and business benefits contemplated by the transaction, that it may incur higher costs to execute the integration of Credit Suisse and that the acquired business may have greater risks or liabilities than expected. Following the failure of Credit Suisse, Switzerland is considering significant changes to its capital, resolution and regulatory regime, which, if proposed and adopted, may significantly increase our capital requirements or impose other costs on UBS These factors create greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions; (iii) inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, residential and commercial real estate markets, general economic conditions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA;
