Thank you. Two questions, please. First one, just follows on from just exactly what you were talking about there, the guidance for the P&L drag from NCL. Obviously, it's going better than expected, which is great to see. What would we expect now \\u2013 previously you were talking about USD 2 billion P&L drag exit rate in 2025 and then USD 1 billion exiting 2026. And obviously it's going much better than that with sort of a UBS 1 billion drag in the second half that you're integrating. What should we expect for 2025? And could the NCL drag be finished within 2025 rather than carrying on into 2026? Any update on that would be really helpful. And then my second question, just a more sort of specific one on investment banking costs. They drifted up a little bit more than revenues in the second quarter, it's not a big move, but the cost income deteriorated against those strong revenues rather than perhaps you might have hoped it could have improved a little bit. So, any comments on the drivers, whether there's any one-offs in there or anything unusual, just how we should interpret that IB cost number, pleaseI'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%. So, I was thinking more Q-on-Q.Which is variable. Okay.Understood. Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"So, Jeremy, thanks. On the second one in the comp on IB costs, it's the comp quarter, of course, only has Credit Suisse personnel in for a short period of time for just the one month when you look at the year-on-year comp, whereas the current quarters as you know the people we've added for the full quarters. So that's driving that that variance.On \\u2013 yeah on Q-on-Q, it would be just some compensation-related effects that were hitting through driving the Q-on-Q. But I'd have to - Go back and look at that. But really, it's more year-on-year that we focused on.On the \\u2013 in terms of the guidance on the P&L drag and in NCL, in terms of what we should expect. Look, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance we've had to date, as I said in my last comments, there's no way to extrapolate from that performance is straight line and to assume that that's the, you know, the pace of which will continue. So, you know, we \\u2013 our guidance remains, that's where in terms of the P&L drag at the end of 2026 is right now, still our best estimate when we come back and talk about an outlook in the fourth quarter going forward, you know, potentially we update that and see where we are. But for now, that's our best estimate in terms of where we land.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thanks.\",\n          \"Well, on the 25%, I mean, it depends how you make the calculation. But you know directionally, what we are saying is that the 25% on a normalized basis will be the maximum. And from there onwards, we will look into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of\\u2026, going forward. And most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part of our offering. The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may have different views on certain client segments or people. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, Chris. On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9nerale\",\n          \"BNP Paribas Exane\",\n          \"I\\u2019ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hi there. Thank you. Two questions, please. First one, just follows on from just exactly what you were talking about there, the guidance for the P&L drag from NCL. Obviously, it's going better than expected, which is great to see. What would we expect now \\u2013 previously you were talking about USD 2 billion P&L drag exit rate in 2025 and then USD 1 billion exiting 2026. And obviously it's going much better than that with sort of a UBS 1 billion drag in the second half that you're integrating. What should we expect for 2025? And could the NCL drag be finished within 2025 rather than carrying on into 2026? Any update on that would be really helpful. And then my second question, just a more sort of specific one on investment banking costs. They drifted up a little bit more than revenues in the second quarter, it's not a big move, but the cost income deteriorated against those strong revenues rather than perhaps you might have hoped it could have improved a little bit. So, any comments on the drivers, whether there's any one-offs in there or anything unusual, just how we should interpret that IB cost number, pleaseI'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%. So, I was thinking more Q-on-Q.Which is variable. Okay.Understood. Thank you very much.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. One on your favorite topic, capital. Just conceptually, trying to understand, because when the press it\\u2019s reported, or the Minister of Finance speaks, about capital, and we naturally assume it\\u2019s CET1 capital, but do you think it could also partially include additional tier 1 capital, which might make it more manageable for you? And then secondly, on your Global Wealth Management net new loans in the quarter, another decline, it\\u2019s very similar to the Q4 decline. Just trying to reconcile that with your risk appetite returning statement \\u2013 being conscious of the yield curve\\u2019s still not favorable but wondering if it's also more of a risk alignment still going on in the background, which is why your outstanding remains negative? Thank you very much.Understood. Thank you very much.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first, if you could maybe speak about the profitability of the recovery of funds and assets of Credit Suisse and how that's going, the discussion with clients there. And the second is, it looks like, in particular, non-core significantly outperformed your expectation you set in Q2 in the third quarter. So just wondering, what does it mean for the budget, so to say, you have to, for an accelerated rundown in Q4 and beyond. Thank you.Good. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"So, Jeremy, thanks. On the second one in the comp on IB costs, it's the comp quarter, of course, only has Credit Suisse personnel in for a short period of time for just the one month when you look at the year-on-year comp, whereas the current quarters as you know the people we've added for the full quarters. So that's driving that that variance.On \\u2013 yeah on Q-on-Q, it would be just some compensation-related effects that were hitting through driving the Q-on-Q. But I'd have to - Go back and look at that. But really, it's more year-on-year that we focused on.On the \\u2013 in terms of the guidance on the P&L drag and in NCL, in terms of what we should expect. Look, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance we've had to date, as I said in my last comments, there's no way to extrapolate from that performance is straight line and to assume that that's the, you know, the pace of which will continue. So, you know, we \\u2013 our guidance remains, that's where in terms of the P&L drag at the end of 2026 is right now, still our best estimate when we come back and talk about an outlook in the fourth quarter going forward, you know, potentially we update that and see where we are. But for now, that's our best estimate in terms of where we land.\",\n          \"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don\\u2019t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it\\u2019s not \\u2013 we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that \\u2013 i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I\\u2019m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over \\u2013 if, assuming they do \\u2013 over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.
