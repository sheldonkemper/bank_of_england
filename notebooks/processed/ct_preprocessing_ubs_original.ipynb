We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because: one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because: one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

            "Yeah. Thanks. Just two questions. The first one is related to the book value per share guidance that you gave of the 74% increase on day one. Just wondering if that still holds, first of all, at this point, or has that changed post your further analysis. And in that context, should we assume that the purchase accounting, restructuring, asset marks, etcetera, should be captured by the reserves that is being built off what we estimate 21 billion. The second question is in relation to more top down. How we should think about the impact on clients at this point and also retention of clients, especially in wealth management at this point already. And how we should think about retention of clients post the event, the clients that have left. How should we think about your position after that?\n",
            "Sorry if I may. The 74% also includes - but does clearly not include additional charges to the P&L and the rest comes to the P&L, we should assume.\n",
            "Ok.\n",
            "Yeah. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first is just about the mechanics as you pay with the treasury shares if there's a difference versus, yeah, new share issuance just, yeah, conceptually and in terms of the impact. And then secondly, just a different question on your commercial real estate exposure. Can you give us a bit more detail on the regional mix, potentially maturity profile, LTV and so on? Thank you very much.\n",
            "Okay. Thank you. Amit Goel, Barclays Hi. Thank you and welcome back, Sergio, too from me. So, two questions. The first, again, just on the transaction and the announcement on – on day one, I just wanted to check in terms of the cost savings and the timeline for EPS accretion whether or not your conviction levels have changed based on the information that you have had or seen since then. And then secondly, I was a bit surprised by the amount of, I guess, deposit outflow on a reported basis for GWM in the quarter. Do you mind just going through that just going through that in a bit more detail? You know, because obviously that's net of the inflows that we're seeing towards the end of the quarter. So, I appreciate there was a bit of a shift in mix and so forth. But if you could give a bit more color, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "Okay. Thanks. And just on the cost savings, is that kind of, I guess, conditional on what the outcome is for the Swiss business? And is the conviction still there on the greater than 8 billion?\n",
            "Okay. Thank you. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first is you reiterated the 25% of the new group going forward with the investment bank, but if I combined UBS and Credit Suisse as of Q1, I am already at that number before fully transferring the current products and so on? So, does it mean you're already happy with the perimeter of the group and potentially happy to diversify your fixed income business via their credit sales and trading? Or is this number ultimately going lower towards maybe 20% or whatever the number is? And then, secondly, wondering about global wealth management. Do you re-underwrite the Credit Suisse client from a risk perspective? i.e. is there a new onboarding process or do they just join as of…the deal completing? Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative. Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Thank you.\n",
            ", Securitized Products. We're also seeing, you know, strength in Credit and Equities and Macro as well. And, you know, the team has been doing a great job in unwinding these complex, longer dated transactions. And that continues to be what they're going to be focused on doing. So the source of the gains comes from, you know, the ability to add a lot of value to these complex transactions. And you know, to be able to get the transactions closed out at levels that are above book value. And as I highlighted, that's not an expectation that people should continue to have, not least just given that sometimes we're going to make decisions to get out of positions where we know there's significant cost takeout or there's suboptimal capital at the moment, it's very suboptimal from a capital efficiency perspective, and so getting out would release that. So they're going to be a number of factors that – which is why, you know, we don't see 1Q repeating.\n",
            "Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just – I'm sorry to follow up, just one thing. I mean, is it fair to say that a result of the uncertainty and not really changing any step in your strategy and execution of the merger and specifically, with Q4 results, you mentioned, the potential amortization of additional DTA, just confirming this – at the current stage, this is going ahead. And then on the net new assets, the 17 billion [edit: 27 billion] in Q1, that’d be running below, if I were thinking about $100 billion for this year – should it be rather than 100 billion this year, is it more like the 200 billion over the years – or two years – and more backend loaded towards the 2025 to reach the 200 billion? And has the decline in relationship managers had any impact on the net new assets growth in Q1? In the past, you gave us some numbers about departed relationship managers and the assets they have taken with them. Is that the case, as being relatively low? Thank you very much.\n",
            "Thank you. Can I just ask on the DTA please? Are you reiterating that we expect to convert that 2 billion and the 500 million you talked about with Q4 results?\n",
            "Thank you very much. Thank you.\n",
            "Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me, just coming back on the cost issue, and the costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive, you're down 26% quarter-on- quarter. And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction. Just, I mean, the question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in terms of frontloading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL? And then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in any of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be mindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Yeah, good morning, Sergio and Todd. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on risk weighted assets. You have around USD 557 billion, USD 145 billion operational risk weighted assets. And I'm just wondering how we should think about the exit run rates in 2026 in terms of total risk weighted assets as well as in terms of operational risk weighted assets if I may. And then the second question is related to the non- core. Could you talk a little bit about the P&L effects of the non-core ex any more active write-downs or sales, so to say, leading to potential write-downs? I'm just trying to understand the P&L in terms of run rate of the noncore legacy bank, if I may. Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Okay. Thank you. If I may just very briefly on the risk weighted assets, if I – to take a very simplistic view and I just assume. I know the runoff, I can make some assumptions about Basel IV then op risk which is clearly very difficult to predict if I want to be conservative. One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets conservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline?\n",
            "Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on revenue cost synergies. I mean, you had a comment and especially if you think you can keep this with market share unchanged. Is it something you really think maybe people get overly concerned and you don't see quite that risk of a revenue dissynergies even if you potentially have to contract some of this at bit more attractive rates or incentivizing your advisors? And then secondly, on slide 16 where you show us the return path and there's this block about the funding cost efficiencies. And that's something you – I guess apart from the drop out of the higher expense funding at Credit Suisse, is there other areas where you see the material benefits from lowering funding costs and overall group benefits because this block is the same size as the cost base rightsizing? Obviously can maybe elaborate a bit more on that area. Thank you.\n",
            "Hi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time trying to update estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate, are you able to give any color in terms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you’d like it to trend? And then secondly, just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of curious things like, you know, 10 billion gross, but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that do you expect to do where you found the incremental 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also, how you're spending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. So, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well. Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again for the disclosure. I hope some of the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard before from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are roughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share – share with us the advisory part of that so we can kind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be paying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates? And in that context, if you could briefly talk about lending, which was down ex-US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your offering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending? And then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further legal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what capital relief you expect from that or maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the changes that will happen in when you describe it here on the page.\n",
            "Morgan And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at similar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last number we saw was $35.7 billion?\n",
            "Morgan Thanks. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question – questions. The first one is just on the Basel IV impact of the USD 25 billion on the 1st of January 2025. I guess you said you will give us a bit more detail with potentially before year-end. But I mean, you previously talked about a USD 15 billion net of, yeah, Non-core rundown. Do you have a – can you give us a better indication of how the USD 25 billion will actually look on the 1st of January 2025? And then, sorry, coming back on the NII guidance, just confirming the P&C reiterating of guidance that's on the US dollar basis rather than Swiss francs. And just conceptually, I mean I see, I mean, you now assume more rate cuts than before, but the guidance is reiterated. Can you just maybe highlight what the missing pieces that allows you to reiterate guidance? Thank you very much.\n",
            "Sorry, just to follow up. So on the 1st of January 25, as the 25 – I mean, the 5% increase in RWA or should it be lower because some mitigation or NCL run down has already kicked-in or reduced the impact?\n",
            "Okay. Thank you very much. Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first, you've guided for banking to generate almost twice the baseline revenues by 2026 assuming supportive markets. So, obviously performance was very strong in the second quarter. But then we saw this period of elevated volatility at the start of August. Has that changed anything in terms of how close we are now to supportive markets? And how would you expect the recovery to progress through the second half of this year? And then second question, just on profitability, at the start of the year, you said you'd expect to get to around 45% of the USD 13 billion gross savings by the end of 2024, and you've got that by the end of the first half. And you also guided for mid-single-digit underlying return on core tier one this year and mid to high for next year. Consensus is at 6% for this year and 9% for next year. But in the first half you're already above 9%. So how should we be thinking now about the path for underlying return on core tier one through 2024 and 2025?\n",
            "Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So one, just to follow up, just to make sure I also had some of the previous guidance correctly. And I think you mentioned the cost of the reprice on sweep to be about USD 50 million annually. And so, I mean, I guess, given the one third advisory disclosure, that would imply only, you know, just over 40 bps of incremental cost on that portion and effectively nothing on the rest. So, I mean I was just kind of curious, I mean, in a way that you could continue to see outflows, so I'm wondering what the capacity is for the group to replace that funding at similar cost? And then also just linked to that, if I look then at the total sweep and the cost of the sweep, it seems like that the earnings are pretty similar to what Wealth Management Americas generates. So I'm just kind of curious how you think about Wealth Management Americas profitability and with some of these headwinds, how you think you'll get back to that mid-teens operating margin? And then secondly, just curious on the parent, you know, is there any scope to shift exposure from foreign participations to domestic in addition to capital repatriation? And, you know, whether that can be reflected in participation values and, you know, if there is potentially will change coming. Thank you.\n",
            "Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking – are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.\n",
            "Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?\n",
            "Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on buyback in 2025. The second quarter stage, you were not commenting yet on buyback. Clearly, that changed at a recent conference and reconfirming this, Sergio, today as well. I just wanted to understand what the thinking is in terms of changing the buyback view in 2025 and how that fits into the regulatory regime changes that might come in the future. And in that context, if you could just also indicate if you will make any comments with the full-year results, as you will give us a buyback for 2025, how that fits with regulatory changes, especially I’m referring to the parent bank capital issue? And then the second question is on US wealth management. Are you seeing a peak in yield-seeking from depositors at this point? And we're hearing from US peers that there are some stabilization in sweep accounts. So I'm just trying to understand how lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially impact loan growth, as I can see it's flattish in the quarter.\n",
            "Morgan Thank you.\n",
            "Hi. Thank you. Yeah. So two questions for me, also one on the US wealth business. I found it really interesting, the commentary about potentially looking at acquisitions. I guess what I'm just wondering is then, you know, from a strategy standpoint, if part of the issue in terms of operating margin is the scale and the cost base relative to the revenues, you know, is it now then the case that it's cheaper to acquire than to simply just hire? Because, you know, the US, you know, as you say, is, the focus has been on productivity, reducing FA numbers. So I'm just trying to think, is that because, you know, these 400% recruitment deals are now just too expensive to make it worthwhile, but it's actually just cheaper to buy an organization? And then secondly, just going back on the deposits and the roll-off of the fixed term deposits within wealth, I'm just curious, were those kind of written 12 months ago and, you know, were those done at, kind of, quite high rates? So just curious if there's also potentially some of that effect into Q4 and start of next year? Thank you.\n",
            "Hi. Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. Just two small ones on capital, please. The first one is on the core tier 1 ratio staying, I mean ex the accelerated amortization, stable quarter-on-quarter. And that's in spite of a really strong, like, profit capital generation. I mean, I realized there are a number of things going on, including FX, but is there something else we should keep in mind that only means the capital ratio is flat or you're investing more capital into organic growth? Otherwise, I guess given the strong earnings, the expectation will be the capital generation drives the ratio higher. And then secondly, just on the Basel IV impact, just to confirm, would that be at the UBS AG, would the impact be around 30 basis points as well? Thank you.\n",
            "Ok, thank you.\n",
            "Thank you very much.\n",
            "Good morning, guys. Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third – in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\n",
            "Morgan Yes. First of all, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the slides, I can put together a revenue picture as you're giving some details around return on risk-weighted assets in the long term, as well as your risk- weighted assets overall absolute. So, I get to about $48.5 billion of revenues, which implies around 70% cost income of $34 billion. And clearly, first of all, I wanted to see if the revenue assumption that I'm making here calculation is reasonable and what underlying scenarios you use to calculate that. And secondly, on the cost side, clearly, even if I assume some kind of growth rate in kind of cost inflation, I still see that most of the cost savings come from your legacy non-core reductions. So, it looks like a lot of flexibility. So, can you talk a little bit about – is my calculation correct to some extent? And secondly, how should I think about the cost flexibility as it seems to mainly come from Non-core and Legacy? That's the first question. If I may, just secondly, on the Investment Bank. You're clearly making a big investment push, and here I want to understand at what point do you see delivery has to be achieved. I think you mentioned end-2026 in terms of revenue improvement, but is there any milestones that have to be achieved order to illustrate that this cost income will continuously improve not just in the first quarter?\n",
            "Morgan Thank you.\n",
            "Yeah. Sorry. Hopefully that works. If you can talk about the path from the 15% to the 18% in 2028 return on core Tier 1 capital. Given you had 15% to 18% before, so how conservative is the timing as well as the 18% compared to your previous range and how much is at self-help versus market? And the second question is a Q4 question. Your net fee generating assets were negative in Q4. If you can maybe elaborate a bit on what's been driving this? Thank you.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "Yeah. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a final one on litigation. Just whether there's anything in the plan for a sort of a business as usual normalized charge for litigation. I know you've taken a lot of adjustments on CS acquisition and you've gotten the $4 billion of balance sheet reserves at this stage, but having had a good chance to look at the case book at this point. Is there anything in there which you think might still burden the P&L over the course of the targets that you’ve laid out this morning? Thanks.\n",
            "Sorry. Yeah. Thank you much for taking my question. Two questions, please. On the first one coming back to the too big to fail was, I mean, you stressed a few times the potential impact on your return currently, on your current assumptions based on 14%. I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but do you think considering depending on the outcome, you will have room to offset your ROE dilution for more capital requirements? And then thank you on the US wealth management operation, a few details here. I'm just wondering obviously you talked about improving the performance of the US operations a few times before. So what will be different this time that this will work out? Thank you very much.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "Yes, thanks for taking my question. I really only have question regarding the key slide 32. Sergio, I get the message: don't get overexcited in terms of how capital would be repatriated and solve potentially a capital issue. But if I look at slide 32 and I got very excited when I saw the 13 billion, but clearly, it hasn't ended up in the parent bank. It has been further upstreamed. It looks like it. And I'm just trying to understand the rationale of the upstream and also trying to understand if there's room to downstream again, if necessary. And in that context and also trying to understand how much more capital is there in CS International? It should be something like 5 billion to 6 billion from what I calculate. And if there's any other subsidiaries that you would highlight, where there's room for potential further upstreaming into the parent going forward? So really just trying to square the process. I'm a little bit confused in that sense and if you could help me, I would really appreciate it.\n",
            "Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\n",
            "And just on double leverage, how much of the 13 billion do you actually require for double leverage and how much do you allocate for payback to shareholders? So we just get an idea how much is potentially excess in the holding, if there's any.\n",
            "Thank you. Okay. And just on the 6 billion in the CS International, roughly 5 to 6 billion, is that correct, that's what's remaining?\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "Hi. Thank you and thank you for the clarifications on the capital. I've got just a couple of questions again on the US business. And so I guess, one, I was just wanted to understand a bit better, you know, as you get to the 15% PBT margin in 2027, you know, what is the kind of plan or thought process in terms of getting to kind of peer levels or 25%, 30% operating margin in the future or do you, I don't know if you think peers are overearning? But what the step is there? And if, you know, building out the more comprehensive banking offering and delivery model is part of that, but what cost is involved in that? And then secondly, also just curious, in terms of the PBT margin that you're targeting to sustain in 2027, I think previously you were talking about mid-teens in 2026. So just to check, is that slightly later or is it the same basic expectation? Thank you.\n",
            "Thank you. Can I just follow up just in terms of that investment and in terms of points of operating margin, would that be kind of 2, 3 or 5 percentage points of operating margin that you're investing in those years or just to think about thereafter, how much could potentially drop out or how much is just ongoing investment?\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "Yes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow-ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the message correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep accounts and obviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, you're little bit below street expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just appetite for re-leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you comment that, please? And then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no change to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your favor on implementation of Basel III final that's caused a delta? Thanks.\n",
            "That's perfect. Thanks. Just on global banking, you mentioned a 20% change in pipeline, was it up or down? I didn't catch that.\n",
            "21, okay. So in any case, to handle in front so...\n",
            "Ok, Thanks very much\n",

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January?

In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.
