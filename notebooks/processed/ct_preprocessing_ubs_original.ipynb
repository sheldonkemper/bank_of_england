We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\",\n          \"Thank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an enthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't really have some, so much low-hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I think that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent and consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know, well ahead of the curve when we started to plan for the 2026 targets. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan Sergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context.\",\n          \"Right. Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative.

Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative. Thank you.\",\n          \"I think, Todd, I mean, let me start with taking the one on \\u2013 you know we are giving as we mentioned last time, we just give you a flavor for the natural decay in order for you to understand that, what will be the leftover in case we do nothing. And as you pointed out, we have been pretty active. Having said that, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to take down 100% or 75% to 100% per se because it all depends on at what terms we will do it. The very critical topic here is that we have to do it in a way that creates value and not just headlines. So, we can get rid of probably many of those positions, but destroying a lot of value. And this will be in conflict with capital accretion and the ability for us to return capital to shareholders. So, I think that it's very clear what is the framework we are using and I think objective number one around non- core is not necessarily just to accelerate the wind down of assets, but it's to take down cost. That's the much more critical element of freeing up capacity and resources.\",\n          \"It\\u2019s in. Okay.

Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative. Thank you.\",\n          \"I think, Todd, I mean, let me start with taking the one on \\u2013 you know we are giving as we mentioned last time, we just give you a flavor for the natural decay in order for you to understand that, what will be the leftover in case we do nothing. And as you pointed out, we have been pretty active. Having said that, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to take down 100% or 75% to 100% per se because it all depends on at what terms we will do it. The very critical topic here is that we have to do it in a way that creates value and not just headlines. So, we can get rid of probably many of those positions, but destroying a lot of value. And this will be in conflict with capital accretion and the ability for us to return capital to shareholders. So, I think that it's very clear what is the framework we are using and I think objective number one around non- core is not necessarily just to accelerate the wind down of assets, but it's to take down cost. That's the much more critical element of freeing up capacity and resources.\",\n          \"It\\u2019s in. Okay.

Thank you. Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions actually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked to do a critical role in Switzerland. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G-SIB asset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. And I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that better than me, you have a MAC clause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012-2013 with mergers by regulators, there would have been an agreement that there's not over-regulation for UBS post the NewCo transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this. The second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what the final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at your legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit, and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the US. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB, I assume its lower returns. So one option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to see if that is also an alternative. Thank you.\",\n          \"I think, Todd, I mean, let me start with taking the one on \\u2013 you know we are giving as we mentioned last time, we just give you a flavor for the natural decay in order for you to understand that, what will be the leftover in case we do nothing. And as you pointed out, we have been pretty active. Having said that, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to take down 100% or 75% to 100% per se because it all depends on at what terms we will do it. The very critical topic here is that we have to do it in a way that creates value and not just headlines. So, we can get rid of probably many of those positions, but destroying a lot of value. And this will be in conflict with capital accretion and the ability for us to return capital to shareholders. So, I think that it's very clear what is the framework we are using and I think objective number one around non- core is not necessarily just to accelerate the wind down of assets, but it's to take down cost. That's the much more critical element of freeing up capacity and resources.\",\n          \"It\\u2019s in. Okay.

The first one I wanted to ask is, I noticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the second quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that the rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then? And another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested in some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 360 ONE. You may not be able to comment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative of any strategic desire to shift more onshore and more into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move? Thank you very much.Todd Tuckner, UBS Hey, Stefan. How are you? On the first \\u2013 yeah, good spot. So the \\u2013 that asymmetry is a function of now, in the lower interest rate environment in Swiss franc terms, it's just the loan flooring dynamics that come into play from negative interest rates. So you see that the down 100 basis points scenario will have a much more limited impact, or an asymmetrical impact to the up 100 basis point impact, in particular in Swissy.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Yeah. And on the second question, you're right, we are not going to comment on any speculations or rumors, but, you know, we do believe that Asia-PAC is a growth business. We have now a stronger presence in India thanks to the combination of the UBS and Credit Suisse capabilities. We always look at ways to enhance our businesses in each key locations where we operate, but I wouldn't draw a conclusion that we are thinking about major strategic moves in terms of segment focus at this stage.Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.\",\n          \"Giulia Aurora Miotto, Morgan Stanley Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital proposal again. And you said, you were not consulted on this document and you need to see what the final proposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you now part of the discussion, do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question. And then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fees better than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what should we expect there? Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS I pick up the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if we're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and so that we can contribute to fact-based discussions. And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight some of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based discussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible date because the commission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that..Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Sergio P. ErmottinanThat one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity about this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. So in the meantime, we have to accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.Todd Tuckner, UBS Yeah, hi Giulia, on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- how one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the environment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows \\u2013 and 1Q was, but I would really highlight that it wasn\\u2019t so much just beta. But actually, it\\u2019s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it\\u2019s an environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in more complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and then also, I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say it gives us confidence as we look out forward. One is that the align product shelf, so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've approached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the playbook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also paying off. So we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to be conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned and really allows us to drive transactional flows higher.Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Thanks.\",\n          \"Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential to your plans because you\\u2019ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The first one I wanted to ask is, I noticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the second quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that the rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then? And another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested in some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 360 ONE. You may not be able to comment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative of any strategic desire to shift more onshore and more into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move? Thank you very much.Todd Tuckner, UBS Hey, Stefan. How are you? On the first \\u2013 yeah, good spot. So the \\u2013 that asymmetry is a function of now, in the lower interest rate environment in Swiss franc terms, it's just the loan flooring dynamics that come into play from negative interest rates. So you see that the down 100 basis points scenario will have a much more limited impact, or an asymmetrical impact to the up 100 basis point impact, in particular in Swissy.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Yeah. And on the second question, you're right, we are not going to comment on any speculations or rumors, but, you know, we do believe that Asia-PAC is a growth business. We have now a stronger presence in India thanks to the combination of the UBS and Credit Suisse capabilities. We always look at ways to enhance our businesses in each key locations where we operate, but I wouldn't draw a conclusion that we are thinking about major strategic moves in terms of segment focus at this stage.Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.\",\n          \"Giulia Aurora Miotto, Morgan Stanley Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital proposal again. And you said, you were not consulted on this document and you need to see what the final proposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you now part of the discussion, do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question. And then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fees better than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what should we expect there? Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS I pick up the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if we're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and so that we can contribute to fact-based discussions. And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight some of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based discussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible date because the commission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that..Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Sergio P. ErmottinanThat one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity about this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. So in the meantime, we have to accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.Todd Tuckner, UBS Yeah, hi Giulia, on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- how one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the environment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows \\u2013 and 1Q was, but I would really highlight that it wasn\\u2019t so much just beta. But actually, it\\u2019s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it\\u2019s an environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in more complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and then also, I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say it gives us confidence as we look out forward. One is that the align product shelf, so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've approached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the playbook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also paying off. So we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to be conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned and really allows us to drive transactional flows higher.Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Thanks.\",\n          \"Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential to your plans because you\\u2019ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The first one I wanted to ask is, I noticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the second quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that the rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then? And another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested in some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 360 ONE. You may not be able to comment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative of any strategic desire to shift more onshore and more into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move? Thank you very much.Todd Tuckner, UBS Hey, Stefan. How are you? On the first \\u2013 yeah, good spot. So the \\u2013 that asymmetry is a function of now, in the lower interest rate environment in Swiss franc terms, it's just the loan flooring dynamics that come into play from negative interest rates. So you see that the down 100 basis points scenario will have a much more limited impact, or an asymmetrical impact to the up 100 basis point impact, in particular in Swissy.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Yeah. And on the second question, you're right, we are not going to comment on any speculations or rumors, but, you know, we do believe that Asia-PAC is a growth business. We have now a stronger presence in India thanks to the combination of the UBS and Credit Suisse capabilities. We always look at ways to enhance our businesses in each key locations where we operate, but I wouldn't draw a conclusion that we are thinking about major strategic moves in terms of segment focus at this stage.Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.\",\n          \"Giulia Aurora Miotto, Morgan Stanley Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital proposal again. And you said, you were not consulted on this document and you need to see what the final proposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you now part of the discussion, do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question. And then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fees better than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what should we expect there? Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS I pick up the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if we're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and so that we can contribute to fact-based discussions. And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight some of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based discussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible date because the commission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that..Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Sergio P. ErmottinanThat one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity about this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. So in the meantime, we have to accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.Todd Tuckner, UBS Yeah, hi Giulia, on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- how one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the environment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows \\u2013 and 1Q was, but I would really highlight that it wasn\\u2019t so much just beta. But actually, it\\u2019s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it\\u2019s an environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in more complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and then also, I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say it gives us confidence as we look out forward. One is that the align product shelf, so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've approached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the playbook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also paying off. So we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to be conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned and really allows us to drive transactional flows higher.Giulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley Thanks.\",\n          \"Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential to your plans because you\\u2019ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.Alastair Ryan, Bank of America Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Two questions, please. The first, if you could maybe speak about the profitability of the recovery of funds and assets of Credit Suisse and how that's going, the discussion with clients there.

So in terms of \\u2013 in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.\",\n          \"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the second person\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"UBS\",\n          \"Deutsche Bank\",\n          \"Unknown\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
