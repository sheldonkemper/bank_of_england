The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again for the disclosure. I hope some of the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard before from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are roughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share \\u2013 share with us the advisory part of that so we can kind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be paying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates? And in that context, if you could briefly talk about lending, which was down ex-US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your offering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending? And then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further legal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what capital relief you expect from that or maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the changes that will happen in when you describe it here on the page.Todd Tuckner, UBS Thanks, Kian for the question. So on, in terms of the second one, first, the simplification that we talk about is continuing in the UK and in the US, but also in other parts of the world, to continue merging subsidiaries out of existence to create and unlock more capital, funding and tax efficiencies, so that's what we're getting to. So we're working all through that, you know, we just, of course, the big parent bank and Swiss bank mergers, we reparented the IHC, but now there's still a lot of work that will continue to unlock these benefits. So in terms of capital relief, naturally, to the extent that, and this goes a little bit to the question that was asked earlier in terms of the repatriation of excess capital, say in a subsidiary, of course, that is part of the analysis that we go through as we work through it. But it's, you know, there are contingencies to the timeline in terms of what triggers and what the timing could be to merge some of these entities out of existence. In terms of GWM, so, you know what I can say on the sweep deposits, first of all, advisory is about a third of the total, the total that we have in sweeps. So, just to give \\u2013 to dimension that a bit, this is I think that's probably useful to understand. And then as far as the pricing it goes, of course, the way we're, first of all, it's a function of interest rates because I mentioned we're going to introduce the new rates in advisory in the fourth quarter because we have to change systems and go through some transitional work to get there. So, we have to see also where interest rates are. So in terms of an absolute price that I can\\u2019t offer, but what I can say is that we will for sure price in the value of the insurance coverage we offer on deposits that benefit from multiple programs, multiple bank programs and reciprocal programs that we've invested in and that will feature into the price of the rate we ultimately offer. In terms lending balances ex-US the main driver of that, I mean, you know, clearly we've seen deleveraging in a higher interest rate market for outside the US, particular in APAC for several quarters running. You know, we're looking forward and seeing some signs of tapering there, but we continue to see that. As I highlighted, you know, as rates come down, we do expect that should taper and then start \\u2013 we start to see clients re- leverage. But so, the rate environment is driving some of that but the other part of it, perhaps the more significant driver is the financial resource optimization work we're doing that, you know, a consequence of that is that loans will roll off our platform, which is one of the points I highlighted in connection with the net new asset report.Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at similar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last number we saw was $35.7 billion?Todd Tuckner, UBS Yeah. What I can say Kian is that the number is across to come in a little bit and it's driven \\u2013 is in also some of the comments I made on mix is driving the 2Q result. So you could assume that number has come a little bit lower and all I could say, you know, get anything further on the rate is, you know, as mentioned competitive dynamics you know will ultimately feature and how we what \\u2013 we ultimately settle on a price \\u2013 on price for the sweep deposits. So, you know, as I said, I gave some views on considerations that we \\u2013 that we will factor in. But as far as an absolute price, you know, that's not at this point something that we have settled on.Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thanks. Anke Reingen, RBC Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question \\u2013 questions. The first one is just on the Basel IV impact of the USD 25 billion on the 1st of January 2025. I guess you said you will give us a bit more detail with potentially before year-end. But I mean, you previously talked about a USD 15 billion net of, yeah, Non-core rundown. Do you have a \\u2013 can you give us a better indication of how the USD 25 billion will actually look on the 1st of January 2025? And then, sorry, coming back on the NII guidance, just confirming the P&C reiterating of guidance that's on the US dollar basis rather than Swiss francs. And just conceptually, I mean I see, I mean, you now assume more rate cuts than before, but the guidance is reiterated. Can you just maybe highlight what the missing pieces that allows you to reiterate guidance? Thank you very much.Todd Tuckner, UBS Yeah, thanks, Anke. So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Piers Brown, HSBC Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me, just coming back on the cost issue, and the costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive, you're down 26% quarter-on- quarter. And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction. Just, I mean, the question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in terms of frontloading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL? And then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in any of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be mindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.Todd Tuckner, UBS Hey Piers. In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship, I would say. It's, it could be, the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly. And that's because, the cost takeout will often come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given infrastructure or application that we\\u2019re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the asset takeout and the cost takeout. I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out portions of a portfolio that still needs at least a large share of the headcount supporting that, whether it's the front office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio. And if you're not really able to decommission the associated technology, you may not get the saves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's something we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high-degree of correlation.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Now on the competitive position. Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that topic. Even if you go down to the substance, which is, I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or everybody to understand. When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in Switzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at branch \\u2013 number of branches; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense. I think we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused with market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement and the facts support our position that our plan is the right one to pursue.Piers Brown, HSBC Thank you.\",\n          \"Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on buyback in 2025. The second quarter stage, you were not commenting yet on buyback. Clearly, that changed at a recent conference and reconfirming this, Sergio, today as well. I just wanted to understand what the thinking is in terms of changing the buyback view in 2025 and how that fits into the regulatory regime changes that might come in the future. And in that context, if you could just also indicate if you will make any comments with the full-year results, as you will give us a buyback for 2025, how that fits with regulatory changes, especially I\\u2019m referring to the parent bank capital issue? And then the second question is on US wealth management. Are you seeing a peak in yield-seeking from depositors at this point? And we're hearing from US peers that there are some stabilization in sweep accounts. So I'm just trying to understand how lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially impact loan growth, as I can see it's flattish in the quarter.Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS  Okay. Thanks, Kian. Well, look, if I \\u2013 if you go back into our remarks, my remarks, in the past, I always clearly stated that starting a buyback program in 2024 would be at the start of a journey that would not be a stop-and-go kind of strategy. So I always, and we always, flagged the fact that in 2025 we would have a share buyback. Now we are reiterating that guidance by saying that we do expect in the early part of 2025, as we present Q4 results, to tell, like we did this year, the amount of ambitions or the size of the ambitions we have for 2025. So in that sense, I think that's \\u2013 I just \\u2013 we are just reiterating our commitments, also in respect of our ambitions for 2026 is that, of course, they are subject to requirements \\u2013 potential new requirements in Switzerland, and then we will assess. But our ambition is to have similar returns we had before the acquisition by 2026. Now for 2025, early 2025, your question, are we going to have more clarity? I don't know. We are not really in control of the timing. I think, I suspect, that we won't be able give a lot of guidance on that \\u2013 in that sense, because, as you know, we are still going through technical discussions. The consultation process probably is gonna start late this year or even in the early part of next year and is gonna to take a few\\u2013 few months, so it's very unlikely that in February we will be able to give much more clarity on this topic. And so this is very unlikely then to affect 2025 capital returns ambitions. And, you know, that also implies that there is no change in terms of the parent bank. As you saw, our parent bank, our overall capital position it's very strong. And also, when you look at our parent bank capital at 13.3% is very solid, is already on a fully applied basis and with a methodology on how we look at valuation of assets and subsidiaries, that is quite conservative definitely compared to what we saw in the past.Todd Tuckner, UBS Hi, Kian. Regarding your second question, in terms of lower rates and impact on our US wealth business. So first on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will \\u2013 and I made this comment earlier in my remarks \\u2013 you know, should spur additional lending opportunities across the division, including in the US. On the deposit side, in particular on sweeps, so first I'd say a couple of things, that we are seeing sweep deposits continue to taper. But in the quarter, we did have smaller outflows, so still about a billion of outflows. You know, I'd say that some of the market dynamics that I see in this regard, you know, one is that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are doing. Secondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra-high net worth. And for sure, that asset band tends to have a much lower percentage of AuM in sweeps. So that's going to be a market dynamic for us that will always weigh on, you know, that, that sensitivity, just given that with a more high net worth client base where there's more sensitivity in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally then there'll be lower balances and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see \\u2013 we will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow.Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again for the disclosure. I hope some of the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard before from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are roughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share \\u2013 share with us the advisory part of that so we can kind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be paying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates? And in that context, if you could briefly talk about lending, which was down ex-US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your offering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending? And then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further legal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what capital relief you expect from that or maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the changes that will happen in when you describe it here on the page. And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at similar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last number we saw was $35.7 billion? Thanks.\",\n          \"Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me, just coming back on the cost issue, and the costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive, you're down 26% quarter-on- quarter. And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction. Just, I mean, the question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in terms of frontloading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL? And then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in any of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be mindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on buyback in 2025. The second quarter stage, you were not commenting yet on buyback. Clearly, that changed at a recent conference and reconfirming this, Sergio, today as well. I just wanted to understand what the thinking is in terms of changing the buyback view in 2025 and how that fits into the regulatory regime changes that might come in the future. And in that context, if you could just also indicate if you will make any comments with the full-year results, as you will give us a buyback for 2025, how that fits with regulatory changes, especially I\\u2019m referring to the parent bank capital issue? And then the second question is on US wealth management. Are you seeing a peak in yield-seeking from depositors at this point? And we're hearing from US peers that there are some stabilization in sweep accounts. So I'm just trying to understand how lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially impact loan growth, as I can see it's flattish in the quarter.

So on, in terms of the second one, first, the simplification that we talk about is continuing in the UK and in the US, but also in other parts of the world, to continue merging subsidiaries out of existence to create and unlock more capital, funding and tax efficiencies, so that's what we're getting to. So we're working all through that, you know, we just, of course, the big parent bank and Swiss bank mergers, we reparented the IHC, but now there's still a lot of work that will continue to unlock these benefits. So in terms of capital relief, naturally, to the extent that, and this goes a little bit to the question that was asked earlier in terms of the repatriation of excess capital, say in a subsidiary, of course, that is part of the analysis that we go through as we work through it. But it's, you know, there are contingencies to the timeline in terms of what triggers and what the timing could be to merge some of these entities out of existence. In terms of GWM, so, you know what I can say on the sweep deposits, first of all, advisory is about a third of the total, the total that we have in sweeps. So, just to give \\u2013 to dimension that a bit, this is I think that's probably useful to understand. And then as far as the pricing it goes, of course, the way we're, first of all, it's a function of interest rates because I mentioned we're going to introduce the new rates in advisory in the fourth quarter because we have to change systems and go through some transitional work to get there. So, we have to see also where interest rates are. So in terms of an absolute price that I can\\u2019t offer, but what I can say is that we will for sure price in the value of the insurance coverage we offer on deposits that benefit from multiple programs, multiple bank programs and reciprocal programs that we've invested in and that will feature into the price of the rate we ultimately offer. In terms lending balances ex-US the main driver of that, I mean, you know, clearly we've seen deleveraging in a higher interest rate market for outside the US, particular in APAC for several quarters running. You know, we're looking forward and seeing some signs of tapering there, but we continue to see that. As I highlighted, you know, as rates come down, we do expect that should taper and then start \\u2013 we start to see clients re- leverage. But so, the rate environment is driving some of that but the other part of it, perhaps the more significant driver is the financial resource optimization work we're doing that, you know, a consequence of that is that loans will roll off our platform, which is one of the points I highlighted in connection with the net new asset report. Yeah. What I can say Kian is that the number is across to come in a little bit and it's driven \\u2013 is in also some of the comments I made on mix is driving the 2Q result. So you could assume that number has come a little bit lower and all I could say, you know, get anything further on the rate is, you know, as mentioned competitive dynamics you know will ultimately feature and how we what \\u2013 we ultimately settle on a price \\u2013 on price for the sweep deposits. So, you know, as I said, I gave some views on considerations that we \\u2013 that we will factor in. But as far as an absolute price, you know, that's not at this point something that we have settled on.\",\n          \"Hey Piers. In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship, I would say. It's, it could be, the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly. And that's because, the cost takeout will often come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given infrastructure or application that we\\u2019re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the asset takeout and the cost takeout. I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out portions of a portfolio that still needs at least a large share of the headcount supporting that, whether it's the front office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio. And if you're not really able to decommission the associated technology, you may not get the saves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's something we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high-degree of correlation.\",\n          \"Okay. Thanks, Kian. Well, look, if I \\u2013 if you go back into our remarks, my remarks, in the past, I always clearly stated that starting a buyback program in 2024 would be at the start of a journey that would not be a stop-and-go kind of strategy. So I always, and we always, flagged the fact that in 2025 we would have a share buyback. Now we are reiterating that guidance by saying that we do expect in the early part of 2025, as we present Q4 results, to tell, like we did this year, the amount of ambitions or the size of the ambitions we have for 2025. So in that sense, I think that's \\u2013 I just \\u2013 we are just reiterating our commitments, also in respect of our ambitions for 2026 is that, of course, they are subject to requirements \\u2013 potential new requirements in Switzerland, and then we will assess. But our ambition is to have similar returns we had before the acquisition by 2026. Now for 2025, early 2025, your question, are we going to have more clarity? I don't know. We are not really in control of the timing. I think, I suspect, that we won't be able give a lot of guidance on that \\u2013 in that sense, because, as you know, we are still going through technical discussions. The consultation process probably is gonna start late this year or even in the early part of next year and is gonna to take a few\\u2013 few months, so it's very unlikely that in February we will be able to give much more clarity on this topic. And so this is very unlikely then to affect 2025 capital returns ambitions. And, you know, that also implies that there is no change in terms of the parent bank. As you saw, our parent bank, our overall capital position it's very strong. And also, when you look at our parent bank capital at 13.3% is very solid, is already on a fully applied basis and with a methodology on how we look at valuation of assets and subsidiaries, that is quite conservative definitely compared to what we saw in the past. Hi, Kian. Regarding your second question, in terms of lower rates and impact on our US wealth business. So first on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will \\u2013 and I made this comment earlier in my remarks \\u2013 you know, should spur additional lending opportunities across the division, including in the US. On the deposit side, in particular on sweeps, so first I'd say a couple of things, that we are seeing sweep deposits continue to taper. But in the quarter, we did have smaller outflows, so still about a billion of outflows. You know, I'd say that some of the market dynamics that I see in this regard, you know, one is that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are doing. Secondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra-high net worth. And for sure, that asset band tends to have a much lower percentage of AuM in sweeps. So that's going to be a market dynamic for us that will always weigh on, you know, that, that sensitivity, just given that with a more high net worth client base where there's more sensitivity in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally then there'll be lower balances and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see \\u2013 we will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
