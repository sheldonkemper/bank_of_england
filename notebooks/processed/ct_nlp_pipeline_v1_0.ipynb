Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nGood morning, Gerard. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\n...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and \\nyou're very \\u2013 I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from \\nthe regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated \\npost-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you \\u2013 based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this \\nconsumer checking account deposits? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThat's fascinating, Gerard. I\\u2019ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is \\nthat when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some \\nexcess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives \\nover the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as \\nmuch yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all \\nthe new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. \\n \\nSo the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of \\nthat franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can \\nyou share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share \\nrepurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to \\nreduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing \\nyour income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  14 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll \\u2013 he wants to go. So, go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nNo. No. Jeremy, go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nNo, no, no. You go. Seriously. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people \\ndon't want it, doesn't add shareholder value. And I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to \\nlook at life and you have to \\\"deploy capital\\\". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special \\ndividends, they really basically don't work. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIf anyone has a different opinion, we're always interested. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nSounds good. Thank you, gentlemen. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks, Gerard. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\",\n          \": Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at \\nInvestor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors \\nwould like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti \\nchart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally \\ngetting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise \\nanyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would \\nyou stay around? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior \\npeople in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the \\nBoard. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the \\nrational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so \\u2013 and what was your first question \\nagain? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  6 \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nWho's your successor? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nOh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing \\nand fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews \\nand meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating \\nOfficer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of \\nmanagement and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And \\nof course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought \\nyou knew today, you couldn't be completely sure. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nSo, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nBasic case, yeah. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\",\n          \": Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q  \\nGood morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all \\nbecause of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the \\nconsumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If \\nyou look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current \\nforwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, \\nwe're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all \\nelse being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. \\n \\nI think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on \\nconsumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a \\nresponse to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being \\nanyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll \\ncross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAnd we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  10 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business \\nglobally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is \\nkind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify \\nmaybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just \\nthink that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the \\nstrategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And  \\npointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and \\nopportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of \\nour management processes. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Hi, Jamie. Jeremy... ...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very \\u2013 I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you \\u2013 based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits? Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective? Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.\",\n          \"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Who's your successor? So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now? All right. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen? Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? Okay.

That's fascinating, Gerard. I\\u2019ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise. Yeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll \\u2013 he wants to go. So, go ahead. No, no, no. You go. Seriously. If anyone has a different opinion, we're always interested. Thanks, Gerard.\",\n          \"I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so \\u2013 and what was your first question again? Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure. Basic case, yeah.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
