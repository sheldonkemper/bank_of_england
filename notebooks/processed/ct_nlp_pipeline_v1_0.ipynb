In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship , I would say. \\nIt's, it could be , the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly.  And that's because, the cost takeout will \\noften come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given \\ninfrastructure or application that we \\u2019re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the \\nasset takeout and the cost takeout.  I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out \\nportions of a portfolio that still needs at least  a large share of the head count supporting that , whether it's the \\nfront office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio.  And if you're not really able to \\ndecommission the associated technology, you may not get the sa ves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's \\nsomething we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high -degree \\nof correlation.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNow on the competitive position. Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that \\ntopic . Even if you go down to the substance, which is , I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or \\neverybody to understand.  When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in \\nSwitzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at \\nbranch  \\u2013 number of branches ; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense.  I \\nthink we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused \\nwith market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement  and the facts \\nsupport our position that our plan is the right one to pursue.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nThank you.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nHi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for \\nthis year in your guidance . If that was zero, what would that \\u2013 or how would that alter your guidance?  \\nAnd then secondly, on the treatment of software intangible s, I suppose  it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a \\nbenefit relative to your European peers. I mean , if you were to align the ru les with Europe, what sort of \\nimpact would that ha ve on your capital? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory \\nframework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms , but also vis -\\u00e0-vis the European \\npeers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital \\nbase.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar  rate cuts . If there were fewer than \\nthose  \\u2013 and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside , but of course, in our NII, but of course \\nthat depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know , behaves. So statically, yes,\",\n          \"15 of 24 \\n the return on CET1, but I would still say mid single -digits is the right way to think about the full year ROCET1 , \\neven with the 1Q performance that we produced.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYes, Chris, first of all, of course, you know, having a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all \\nseasons, as we call it, having a strict risk management approach and policies and being very disciplined in a \\nway we consume and manage all our resources is the pillar number one of our strategy.  And I think it's \\nalmost a prerequisite to create the trust that clients need to have in any bank or any organization.  \\nSo in that sense, I would only add that another very important indicator, which sometimes is in conflict  with \\nclients is your funding cost. Of course, our clients would like to have always a higher returns on the deposits \\nand the investment they place with us. But on the other hand, when they see our funding cost being as \\ncompetitive as we have now, they have the ultimate confirmation of the strength and the solidity of our \\nfranchise . \\nSo ultimately, at the end of the day, it's always a trade -off between different dynamics by, I would say, \\nemotional and psychological dynamics. But I can only tell you that, of course, last but not least, having a full \\nalignment of client trust and satisfa ction, having shareholders being happy, and having your employees being \\nhappy is the ultimate way to create sustainable value and trust in any bank. And this is our philosophy.  \\nSo of course, having an ability to compete in terms of growth and our global ambitions, but at the same time, \\nbeing able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders, it's very important to influence the three stakeholders I \\nmentioned.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sach s \\nRight. Thank you.  \\nKian Abou hossein, JP Morgan  \\nYes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions \\nactually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked \\nto do a critical role in Switzerlan d. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G -SIB \\nasset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. \\nAnd I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that be tter than me, you have a MAC  \\nclause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012 -2013 with \\nmergers  by regulators , there would have been an agreement that there's not over -regulation for UBS post the \\nNewC o transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this.  \\nThe second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what \\nthe final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at \\nyour legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit , and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the \\nUS. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB , I assume its lower returns. So \\none option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to \\nsee if that is also an alternative. Thank you.\",\n          \"19 of 24 \\n And as I highlighted, that's not an expectation that people should continue to have , not least just given that \\nsometimes we're going to make decisions to get out of positions where we know there's significant cost \\ntakeout or there's suboptimal capital  at the moment, it's very suboptimal from a capital efficiency perspective, \\nand so getting  out would  release  that. So they're going to be a number of factors that  \\u2013 which is why , you \\nknow, we don't see 1Q repeating.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo if I can add  on that one , before I touch on the second question . I think that's the  \\u2013 first of all, there is \\ndefinitely no low hanging fruit and if you look at our natural decay  profile change, it shows you that we are \\nnot really going for easy to sell but rather complex transaction s that also helps in many cases to unwind costs , \\nbecause priority number one in Non-core is to take down cost , and not necessarily to take down risk \\nweighted assets and market or credit risk weighted assets.   \\nSo, in that sense, it's very important that in many cases we are able, thanks to the good work the team is \\ndoing in managing these unwinds , to leverage the fact that we are not a forced seller. We are only going to \\ndispose assets when they create value to shareholders. And that's a \\u2013 is a completely different position to be \\nin because our capital is strong. We can allow some delays or some time to elapse between the two.  \\nNow on the 9 billion , so there are two factors actually; one is the 250 % risk weightings and 400 % for foreign \\ncompanies and the elimination of the filter \\u2013 of the regulatory filter that Credit Suisse had. The two combined \\naccount for 9 billion.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nAnd the ability to mitigate any increase in the foreign subsidiaries going forward ? Assum e it\\u2019s something \\nyou're already w orking  on given the already base increase , to what extent you th ink you could accelerate \\nthat. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNo the mitigation \\u2013 look the mitigation I go back to is \\u2013 I mean, I have to \\u2013 it\\u2019s like replay, push the button \\nagain and replay what I told you or what I said before, we cannot speculate or respond to speculation or do \\nanalysis on things that we don't know. What we know is that we're going to hold , as a consequence of the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition , 9 plus 10 billion, so almost 20 billion of additional capital on an already very strong \\ncapital position UBS had . That's the fact. The rest , I don't know and we will comment when we know more.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nBrilliant, v ery clear. Thank you for that.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nYeah, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just \\u2013 I'm sorry to follow  up, just one thing. I mean, is \\nit fair to say that a result of the uncertainty and not really changing any step in your strategy and execution of \\nthe merger and specifically, with Q4 results , you mentioned, the potential amortization of additional D TA, just \\nconfirming this \\u2013 at the current stage, this is going ahead.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship, I would say. It's, it could be, the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly. And that's because, the cost takeout will often come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given infrastructure or application that we\\u2019re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the asset takeout and the cost takeout. I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out portions of a portfolio that still needs at least a large share of the head count supporting that, whether it's the front office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio. And if you're not really able to decommission the associated technology, you may not get the saves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's something we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high-degree of correlation. Hey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar rate cuts. If there were fewer than those \\u2013 and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes\",\n          \"Yes, Chris, first of all, of course, you know, having a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all seasons, as we call it, having a strict risk management approach and policies and being very disciplined in a way we consume and manage all our resources is the pillar number one of our strategy. And I think it's almost a prerequisite to create the trust that clients need to have in any bank or any organization. So in that sense, I would only add that another very important indicator, which sometimes is in conflict with clients is your funding cost. Of course, our clients would like to have always a higher returns on the deposits and the investment they place with us. But on the other hand, when they see our funding cost being as competitive as we have now, they have the ultimate confirmation of the strength and the solidity of our franchise. So ultimately, at the end of the day, it's always a trade-off between different dynamics by, I would say, emotional and psychological dynamics. But I can only tell you that, of course, last but not least, having a full alignment of client trust and satisfaction, having shareholders being happy, and having your employees being happy is the ultimate way to create sustainable value and trust in any bank. And this is our philosophy. So of course, having an ability to compete in terms of growth and our global ambitions, but at the same time, being able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders, it's very important to influence the three stakeholders I mentioned.\",\n          \"So if I can add on that one, before I touch on the second question. I think that's the \\u2013 first of all, there is definitely no low hanging fruit and if you look at our natural decay profile change, it shows you that we are not really going for easy to sell but rather complex transactions that also helps in many cases to unwind costs, because priority number one in Non-core is to take down cost, and not necessarily to take down risk weighted assets and market or credit risk weighted assets. So, in that sense, it's very important that in many cases we are able, thanks to the good work the team is doing in managing these unwinds, to leverage the fact that we are not a forced seller. We are only going to dispose assets when they create value to shareholders. And that's a \\u2013 is a completely different position to be in because our capital is strong. We can allow some delays or some time to elapse between the two. Now on the 9 billion, so there are two factors actually; one is the 250 % risk weightings and 400 % for foreign companies and the elimination of the filter \\u2013 of the regulatory filter that Credit Suisse had. The two combined account for 9 billion. No the mitigation \\u2013 look the mitigation I go back to is \\u2013 I mean, I have to \\u2013 it\\u2019s like replay, push the button again and replay what I told you or what I said before, we cannot speculate or respond to speculation or do analysis on things that we don't know. What we know is that we're going to hold, as a consequence of the Credit Suisse acquisition, 9 plus 10 billion, so almost 20 billion of additional capital on an already very strong capital position UBS had. That's the fact. The rest, I don't know and we will comment when we know more.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Name of the second person\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sergio P.

Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that topic. Even if you go down to the substance, which is, I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or everybody to understand. When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in Switzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at branch \\u2013 number of branches; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense. I think we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused with market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement and the facts support our position that our plan is the right one to pursue. So, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory framework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms, but also vis-\\u00e0-vis the European peers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital base.\",\n          \"Right.

              "\"Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. A billion dollar beat in the quarter. I never did quite get the hang of \\nforecasting lark. Just on that then -- so non -core, very strong performance and appreciate the updated runoff \\nprofile you give us on slide 6. Is there any reason that you're just reverting to natural runoff or can we expect \\ncontinued sales if markets stay favorable bec ause clearly there's quite a meaningful driver of the very \\nfavorable capital ratio and the interactions of all of those.  \\nAnd then secondly, the project to improve the revenue to risk -weighted assets in wealth management, are \\npresumably, you wouldn't represent the Q1 performances kind of the payoff of that project is? It's too early \\nbut just what's the profile of that project? How long is that repricing sitting on the net new asset generation \\nand has it started ? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nAlastair, before I pass to Todd, I wanted to -- you were the first to ask the question not by coincidence since I \\nunderstand it's your last day at the office, so.  \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nYes, yes . Thank you , Sergio . \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, enjoy -- enjoy your time of f going forward. So, I'll pass it over to Todd. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Alastair. Thanks for the questions. So on NCL, I mean first reverting to natural runoff. I mean, we've \\nbeen consistent in just reflecting the natural runoff profile. What I think the slide 6 really does indicate is, it \\nreally narrows that, that delta between where we started, you know, as you can see where we set our \\nambition is to reduce to 5% and , you know , that the natural runoff profile has really come in.  \\nYou see that the delta between the natural runoff profile and where we , our ambition is narrowed. So that \\nshould, eliminate whatever uncertainty was considered, but I do think that it's appropriate still to reflect it \\nthat way in terms of, you know, whether we can do more of course we're going to continue to do what we \\ncan. \\nWe'll try to position -- we'll try to exit positions, at or above their, their book values wherever possible. But, \\nyou know, it's appropriate to continue to stick with our guidance on NCL, in terms of , you know,  our \\napproach, and in terms of our expectations around revenues.  \\nOn GWM in terms of revenue over the RWA, I mentioned that we're starting to see progress, which of course \\ndoes suggest you asked, has it started and it has. In fact, it started at the end of last year and the business is \\nquite active in it.  \\n \\n Page 14 of 24 \\n And, and so, we would expect that we're going to continue to make progress on driving up RWA efficiency \\nwith respect to revenues in that respect over the course of the next couple of years.  You asked how long that \\nwill impact. How long will it go? How long will it impact net new assets? We said, it's going to take the better \\npart of two years which is why we g uided  net new assets of around 200 billion over that two -year timeframe. \\nAnd we think that's the appropriate guidance still.  \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nOkay. Thank you . And Sergio, thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSure. Pleasure.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sach s \\nYeah. So two for me, by the end of the year, I guess, you'll be effectively halfway through the integration \\nprocess in terms of gro ss savings. So as you get through that process, are you starting to get a better picture \\nof what you could expect for the net savings figure in relation to the 13 billion? Todd, I think you mentioned \\nthe majority earlier. And does that change at all the phasing of the multi -year return on core tier 1 p ath you \\nlaid out the full year?  \\nAnd then second question. Sergio, you referenced earlier that insufficient capital didn't cause the collapse of \\nCS and I guess, in the final instance, what we really saw was a crisis in client confidence that drove that \\nliquidity shortfall. So when we talk about capital distribution, it's sort of automatic to assume that higher or \\nearlier capital distribution, results in lower capital ratios, which in turn, reduces resilience.  \\nBut when you talk to clients, how important is that distribution ambition as an indicator and driver of \\nconfidence  in the business i.e ,. like could you argue that ultimately aligning your distribution strategy more \\nclosely with the distribution policies we see elsewhere in European financials , actually increases client \\nconfidence in the business and improves resilience. There's a big perception  difference basically between the \\nfirm that ’s buying back stock versus a firm that ’s issuing stock?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hey Chris, I ’ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better \\nview on the net that we ’ll get to. Look, you know I think we're quite pleased with that 1Q operating expense \\nperformance.  \\nWe did highlight that we expect gross sa ves to be halfway to our 13 billion ambitions at the end of the year \\nwhich is a bit better than we highlighted in February in large part because of the 1Q performance that we \\nsaw. But look, we still -- our ambition is a cost -to-income ratio of less than 70%  at the end of 2026. That's \\nwhat we're really focused on to manage to and so how we pace any investments, which we'll continue to \\nmake in, for example, the resilience of our infrastructure, the organic growth in our core businesses, how we \\npace that will b e a function of the revenue environment. So it is still -- it is still way too early to change that \\nperspective. But of course, we are pleased with the opex performance we saw in 1Q.  \\nAs to how that impacts on the return on CET1 path that you mentioned, I would say that coupled with the \\nupdated NCL full -year PBT guidance I gave , would have roughly 100 to - slightly above basis point impact on \\n \\n Page 15 of 24 \\n the return on CET1, but I would still say mid single -digits is the right way to think about the full year ROCET1 , \\neven with the 1Q performance that we produced.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYes, Chris, first of all, of course, you know, having a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all \\nseasons, as we call it, having a strict risk management approach and policies and being very disciplined in a \\nway we consume and manage all our resources is the pillar number one of our strategy.  And I think it's \\nalmost a prerequisite to create the trust that clients need to have in any bank or any organization.  \\nSo in that sense, I would only add that another very important indicator, which sometimes is in conflict  with \\nclients is your funding cost. Of course, our clients would like to have always a higher returns on the deposits \\nand the investment they place with us. But on the other hand, when they see our funding cost being as \\ncompetitive as we have now, they have the ultimate confirmation of the strength and the solidity of our \\nfranchise . \\nSo ultimately, at the end of the day, it's always a trade -off between different dynamics by, I would say, \\nemotional and psychological dynamics. But I can only tell you that, of course, last but not least, having a full \\nalignment of client trust and satisfa ction, having shareholders being happy, and having your employees being \\nhappy is the ultimate way to create sustainable value and trust in any bank. And this is our philosophy.  \\nSo of course, having an ability to compete in terms of growth and our global ambitions, but at the same time, \\nbeing able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders, it's very important to influence the three stakeholders I \\nmentioned.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sach s \\nRight. Thank you.  \\nKian Abou hossein, JP Morgan  \\nYes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions \\nactually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked \\nto do a critical role in Switzerlan d. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G -SIB \\nasset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. \\nAnd I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that be tter than me, you have a MAC  \\nclause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012 -2013 with \\nmergers  by regulators , there would have been an agreement that there's not over -regulation for UBS post the \\nNewC o transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this.  \\nThe second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what \\nthe final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at \\nyour legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit , and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the \\nUS. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB , I assume its lower returns. So \\none option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to \\nsee if that is also an alternative. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 24 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you. Yeah, v ery good question. Yeah, I think that -- let me put it that way that some of the conditions \\nthat were discussed and agreed at over that weekend that were clearly, defined and communicated for \\nexample, the one in respect of the antitrust and the competitive nature in our local markets that has been \\nvery well defined and agreed. Others , I would say , were also discussed and agreed.  \\nLet me put it that way. I'm not so sure we can talk about a MAC clau se but as I mentioned in my opening \\nremarks, we are delivering on our commitments. So I probably stop here.  \\nAnd in respect of the amount of capital and I think it's clearly too early to speculate or respond to \\nspeculations around the capital. I just want to underline that when we talk about our parent company , you \\nknow, UBS had already up for -- one of the best in class capitalization, the quality of our capital in the parent \\ncompany was very strong. What I mentioned that is already embedded in our plan. We are absorbing USD 9 \\nbillion of concession granted to Credit Suisse. We are absorbing the progressive buffers that will come in as a \\nconsequence of market share and size. And we believe this is feasible and is part of the plan.  \\nSo, before we speculate about what we would do  to respond to any other changes in regulatory \\nrequirements, we need to understand what they are, because , believe me , we have not been consulted. We \\ndon't know what they are. And so, we need to have the full picture before we respond to this kind of \\nsituations.  \\nBut let me just say that having a global franchise, being competitive globally, is what makes us a very attractive \\nbank to our clients. Shrinking back to greatness is not a strategy and is not what will serve , not only our clients \\nand our shareholders well, but I'm also convinced is not going to serve well, Switzerland and i ts ambitions to \\nbe one of the leading financial center in the world. That's pretty clear to me.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP Morgan  \\nThank you.  \\nGiulia Aurora Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital \\nproposal again. And you said, you were not con sulted  on this document and you need to see what the final \\nproposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you \\nnow part of the discussion , do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question.  \\nAnd then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fee s \\nbetter than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what \\nshould we expect there? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nI pick up  the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if \\nwe're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my \\nremarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and \\nso that we can contri bute to  fact-based discussion s.  \\n \\n Page 17 of 24 \\n And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight \\nsome of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based \\ndiscussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible dat e because the \\ncommission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that .. \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nJune 2025 I meant, sorry.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThat one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity \\nabout this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. \\nSo in the meantime, we have to  accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah, hi Giulia , on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- \\nhow one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the \\nenvironment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows – and 1Q was, but I would really highlight \\nthat it wasn ’t so much just beta.  \\nBut actually, it ’s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it ’s \\nan environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in \\nmore complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and \\nthen also , I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say  it gives us confidence as \\nwe look out forward.  \\nOne is that the align product shelf , so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've \\napproached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the \\nplaybook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also \\npaying off.  \\nSo we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to \\nbe conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned \\nand really allows us to drive transactional flows higher . \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThanks.  \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas Exane  \\nThank you. Good morning. Two questions, please. One is, you talked about the Investment Bank and the core \\nbusinesses that you've retained from Credit Suisse and the people you've brought over. I just wanted to – are \\nthey now fully productive in revenue terms ? Or is there some lag still to come through, as those people ramp \\nup? Are they up to speed already at this point?  \\n \\n Page 18 of 24 \\n And then my second question is sort of, again, on the capital theme. I saw in the report, you reiterate your \\nintention to do the 1 billion of buybacks in the second half of this year. I guess, that's a small enough amount \\nthat you can do it pretty much reg ardless of the new capital proposals. But I just wanted to hear your \\nthoughts on that.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, let me take the first question is very  – you know,  of course everybody is now up and running and \\nproductive. And – but when you look at Banking, as you know, what does it mean being productive?   It does,  \\nyou know , there is a phase of going out and pitching and winning mandates and then it takes time until they \\nget executed. So, in a sense if you are asking me if they are productive in pitching and being engaged with \\nclients, they are . Everybody is full speed.  The momentum in winning mandates is great. You could see it in the \\nfourth quarter. In the first quarter, we have executed many of them. And we are very comfortable that the \\ninvestments and the trajectory of growth that we see going forward, if market conditions stay there to allow \\nthe execution of those mandates , are very promising.  \\nIn respect of the billion , so I think that you know, at this stage, the only constraints we have right now is the \\nwaiting until the parent bank merger is executed. We expect this to be in at the end of May and if everything \\ngoes through successfully , pending the regulatory approvals that we need , we intend to restart the share \\nbuybacks with up to a billion dollars for 2024.  \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas Exane  \\nVery helpful, thank you.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nGood morning. Two questions please, bas ic follow  ups. Firstly on the Non-core result, obviously a tremendous \\nresult both in terms of the RWA run -down but also the gains that you've booked during the quarter. Thank \\nyou for the revised guidance for the full year.  I just wanted to better understand the source of those gains in \\nQ1, I think you said conduit and corporate loan books and longevity portfolio. You  then don't expect that to \\nrepeat going forward. Is that because the low hanging fruit has already been achieved or because you're now \\nselling a different type of a sset, or anything  you can elaborate there will be  helpful.  \\nAnd then the second question, thank you for  the opening remark s, Sergio . On the parent bank capital , I just \\nwanted to check , the 9 billon you referenced , is that in relation to a 400% risk -weight  on foreign subsidiaries, \\nor is it the 300% as i t currently is phased? And then more broadly , a question  to the both of you , in the event \\nthat the risk weight on foreign subsidiaries does go up, to what extent do you think you can mitigate that \\nthrough the fungibility of capital , dividend , trapped capital and so forth? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Andrew. I'll address the first question. I mean, in terms of the source of the gains, I think as , you know, as  \\nyou mentioned, and as of course I highlighted , it came from a number of the sort of sectors within NCL, \\nConduit , and Corporate Loans, Longevity , Securitized Products. We're also seeing, you know, strength  in \\nCredit and Equities and Macro as well. And, you know, the team has been doing a great job in unwinding \\nthese complex, longer dated transactions. And that continues to be what they're going to be focused on \\ndoing. So the source of the gains comes from , you know, the ability to add a lot of value to these complex \\ntransactions.  And you know, to be able to get the transactions closed out at levels that are above book value.  \\n \\n Page 19 of 24 \\n And as I highlighted, that's not an expectation that people should continue to have , not least just given that \\nsometimes we're going to make decisions to get out of positions where we know there's significant cost \\ntakeout or there's suboptimal capital  at the moment, it's very suboptimal from a capital efficiency perspective, \\nand so getting  out would  release  that. So they're going to be a number of factors that  – which is why , you \\nknow, we don't see 1Q repeating.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo if I can add  on that one , before I touch on the second question . I think that's the  – first of all, there is \\ndefinitely no low hanging fruit and if you look at our natural decay  profile change, it shows you that we are \\nnot really going for easy to sell but rather complex transaction s that also helps in many cases to unwind costs , \\nbecause priority number one in Non-core is to take down cost , and not necessarily to take down risk \\nweighted assets and market or credit risk weighted assets.   \\nSo, in that sense, it's very important that in many cases we are able, thanks to the good work the team is \\ndoing in managing these unwinds , to leverage the fact that we are not a forced seller. We are only going to \\ndispose assets when they create value to shareholders. And that's a – is a completely different position to be \\nin because our capital is strong. We can allow some delays or some time to elapse between the two.  \\nNow on the 9 billion , so there are two factors actually; one is the 250 % risk weightings and 400 % for foreign \\ncompanies and the elimination of the filter – of the regulatory filter that Credit Suisse had. The two combined \\naccount for 9 billion.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nAnd the ability to mitigate any increase in the foreign subsidiaries going forward ? Assum e it’s something \\nyou're already w orking  on given the already base increase , to what extent you th ink you could accelerate \\nthat. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNo the mitigation – look the mitigation I go back to is – I mean, I have to – it’s like replay, push the button \\nagain and replay what I told you or what I said before, we cannot speculate or respond to speculation or do \\nanalysis on things that we don't know. What we know is that we're going to hold , as a consequence of the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition , 9 plus 10 billion, so almost 20 billion of additional capital on an already very strong \\ncapital position UBS had . That's the fact. The rest , I don't know and we will comment when we know more.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nBrilliant, v ery clear. Thank you for that.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nYeah, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just – I'm sorry to follow  up, just one thing. I mean, is \\nit fair to say that a result of the uncertainty and not really changing any step in your strategy and execution of \\nthe merger and specifically, with Q4 results , you mentioned, the potential amortization of additional D TA, just \\nconfirming this – at the current stage, this is going ahead.  \\n \\n Page 20 of 24 \\n And then on the net new assets, the 17 billion  [edit: 27 billion]  in Q1, that ’d be running below , if I were \\nthinking about $100 billion for this year  – should  it be rather than 100 billion this year , is it more like the 200 \\nbillion over the year s – or two years  – and more back end loaded towards the 2025 to reach the 200 billion ? \\nAnd has the decline in relationship managers had any impact on the net new assets growth in Q1 ? In the \\npast, you gave us some numbers about departed  relationship managers and the assets they have taken with \\nthem. Is that  the case , as being relatively low? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, I’ll take the first question. I think that , Anke, I think  – this is a very complex integration, and we \\ncannot afford to be distracted in the execution of it. So we are sticking to our strategy. We are sticking to our \\nplan. We need to do that and at the same time, stay close to our clients. And so that's the reason why \\nengaging in hypothetical change of strategy or methodology we use in assess our – anything that goes \\naround capital – would be absolutely very distracting and not in the best interest of any stakeholders , because \\nwhat we want to have is a successful completion of this integration. And so we stay focused on the existing \\nstrategy and our approach . \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah Anke, on th e second question, in terms of net new assets in GWM. I would just reiterate that  the \\ntrajectory that we highlighted over the next two years is, among other things, a function of the financial \\nresource optimization and balance sheet initiatives that the team is hard at work in undertaking . So 27 billion \\nin the quarter is a strong result, we're on track to deliver on our ambitions, which we said was 200 billion \\nover the course of two years. So I would continue to think about that in those terms.  \\nIn terms of the RM s who have left, you mentioned that we had given some numbers in the past. Yeah, I \\nmean, that has continued just to taper. As an impact, just given the number of RM s who have left , has \\nbecome sort of a non -topic at this point in time.  In terms of any current period, and in terms of the assets \\nthat they’ve taken with them, it is a very small percentage , ultimately, of the given – especially given the fact \\nthat the RM workforce in Credit Suisse is down 40% from the end of 2022 levels, and we've been able to \\nretain the lion  share of the assets. So, we consider that to be sort of a story not terribly worth following, and \\nin the end, we stay focused on our plans and our commitments.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC  \\nThank you. Can I just ask on the DTA please? Are you reiterating that we expect to convert that 2 billion and \\nthe 500 million you talked about with Q4 results?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. There's no change in terms of our approach to DTA s at the current time, An ke. \\nAnke Reingen , RBC  \\nThank you very much. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 24 \\n Benjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nHi. Good morning. Two questions, please. One on your favorite topic , capital . Just conceptually , trying to \\nunderstand, because when the press i t’s reported , or the Minister of Finance speaks , about  capital , and we \\nnaturally assume it’s CET1 capital, but do you think it  could  also partially include additional tier 1  capital, \\nwhich might make it more manageable for you?  \\nAnd then secondly, on your  Global  Wealth Management net new loans in the quarter, another decline , it’s \\nvery similar to the Q4 decline. Just trying to reconcile that with your risk appetite returning statement  – being \\nconscious of the yield curve ’s still not  favorable but wondering if it's also more of a risk alignment still going \\non in the background, which is why your outstanding  remains negative ? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nBenjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don ’t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any \\nnumbers that has been flagged out there. So it ’s not – we are not in a position to understand where and how \\nthose  numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of \\nthat is market driven and some of that – i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource \\noptimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing , to the extent it is the la tter, \\nwe are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I ’m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that \\nrespect , because we're improving the revenue o ver RWA consideration.  \\nBut obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet \\nsome reticence to re -lever in some of our regions. So I expect that  we won't have a lot of momentum on re -\\nlevering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down , over – if, assuming they do – \\nover the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be , to me , a big driver in terms of \\nreleverage.  \\nBenjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two f rom me, just coming back on the cost issue, and \\nthe costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive , you're down 26% quarter -on-\\nquarter.  And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction . Just, I mean, \\nthe question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in \\nterms of front loading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL?  \\nAnd then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in \\nany of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be \\nmindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.  \\n \\n \\n Page 22 of 24 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nHey Piers. In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship , I would say. \\nIt's, it could be , the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly.  And that's because, the cost takeout will \\noften come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given \\ninfrastructure or application that we ’re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the \\nasset takeout and the cost takeout.  I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out \\nportions of a portfolio that still needs at least  a large share of the head count supporting that , whether it's the \\nfront office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio.  And if you're not really able to \\ndecommission the associated technology, you may not get the sa ves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's \\nsomething we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high -degree \\nof correlation.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNow on the competitive position. Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that \\ntopic . Even if you go down to the substance, which is , I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or \\neverybody to understand.  When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in \\nSwitzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at \\nbranch  – number of branches ; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense.  I \\nthink we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused \\nwith market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement  and the facts \\nsupport our position that our plan is the right one to pursue.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nThank you.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nHi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for \\nthis year in your guidance . If that was zero, what would that – or how would that alter your guidance?  \\nAnd then secondly, on the treatment of software intangible s, I suppose  it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a \\nbenefit relative to your European peers. I mean , if you were to align the ru les with Europe, what sort of \\nimpact would that ha ve on your capital? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory \\nframework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms , but also vis -à-vis the European \\npeers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital \\nbase.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar  rate cuts . If there were fewer than \\nthose  – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside , but of course, in our NII, but of course \\nthat depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know , behaves. So statically, yes, \\n \\n Page 23 of 24 \\n that would be corrected to be upside.  If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or \\ntwo on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client \\nbehavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that – likely to be \\nsome degree of upside, all other things equal.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\nSarah Mackey  \\nThank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and \\nTodd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n Page 24 of 24 \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,”  \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate,  sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual dev elopments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and \\nconflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflatio nary \\npressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displaceme nt, and lead to shortages of \\nvital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately i nvolved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the \\narmed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia –Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and \\nBelarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertai nty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse \\neffects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Cr edit Suisse Group has \\nmaterially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit  Suisse entities into the UBS \\nstructure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve \\nthe cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward -looking statements. \\nOther factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the \\ndegree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initia tives and its ability to m anage its \\nlevels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including  changes in RWA \\nassets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing \\nchanges to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) \\nincreased inflation and interes t rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates \\nor to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, de teriora tion or slow recovery in \\nresidential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressur es, market developments, \\nincreasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the f inancial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as \\nwell as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adv erse changes in UBS’s credit spreads \\nand credit ratin gs of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit -related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding \\nto meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes \\nin central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU  and other financial centers that \\nhave imposed, or resulted in, or may do so i n the future, more stringent or entity -specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity \\nand funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, li mitations on per mitted \\nactivities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs a cross the Group or other measures, \\nand the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability  to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory \\nrequirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to leg al and regulatory \\nrequirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and \\nimprove its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of mone y laundering to meet \\nevolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising f rom domestic stresses in certain \\nmajor economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regul atory capital and other requirements among the major \\nfinancial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of co nduct applicable to our businesses \\nthat may result from new regulations or new  enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting \\nwith customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, o r possible constraints or  \\nsanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigation s, including the potential for \\ndisqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the los s of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other \\ngovernmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk co mponent of our RWA, including \\nas a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s \\nbusiness, in particular cross -border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and  practices; (xiv) UBS’s \\nability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses,  which may be affected by \\ncompetitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and  determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, \\nthe valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new tec hnologies and business methods, \\nincluding digital ser vices and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of w hich may \\nnot be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk manageme nt, risk control, measurement and \\nmodeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unaut horized trading, financial crime, \\ncyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of wh ich is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non -nation -state actors \\ntargeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make payments or distributi ons, including due to restrictions \\non the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficul ties, due to the exercise by FINMA or \\nthe regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in rel ation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation \\nproceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors m ay affect UBS’s ability to maintain \\nits stated capital return objective ; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals \\nrelating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the poss ibility of conflict between \\ndifferent governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the abi lity of UBS to successfully recover \\nfrom a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurri cane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g., the Russia –Ukraine war), \\npandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man -made event, including the ability to function \\nremotely during lo ng-term disruptions such as the COVID -19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the \\nintegration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reductio n and divestment of any non -core \\nassets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write -downs, the effect of the consummation of the \\nintegration on the operational results, share price and credit rating o f UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market \\ndisruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or \\nunanticipated events , including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our \\nbusiness and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occu rrence or the potential \\nmagnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and \\nreports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (th e SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in \\ndocuments furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form  20- F for the year \\nended 31 December 2023.
