And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of \\u2013 in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

            "Hi. Good morning. And welcome back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the more integrated disclosure on the beta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly from the U.S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some color on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024. And then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the perimeter of what mean – of what goes into non-core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few years now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS lumps with IBD. I guess the question is how do you see that business within your IB structure?\n",
            "Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take the second question. I think that, yes, the DNA won't change what we do is part of the equation and having a diversified portfolio of businesses does include also having leverage finance. Of course, we are – we will stay very focused on how we are present in that business. We want to be meaningful to our clients, but also to be mindful that you know, this cannot be the driver of the profitability of the investment bank with all associated, you know, volatility and risks. So, you can count on us, or our clients can count on us being a relevant player, but definitely, we are not – our ambition is not to be at the top of the league just for – and to make it a central part of our model. So, expect at the margins a little bit more, but in a very, very focused way. And we will also look at ways to be creative around that business, because there are opportunities for us to also partner with other institutions on how to manage, you know residual risk. So, our ability has to be to be the bridge in the investment bank between different sources of capital and not necessarily originate and store risks.In terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, first of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or below the modelled beta. But then what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which are yielding those higher overall, on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we are in the cycle. So in the U.S. where those very high rates where we are at very high incremental betas. And that's continuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in Europe, we went from being really at fairly low levels to – now moving into a place where there is price sensitivity, especially for GWM clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit of mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix shift there. And then on – in Switzerland, you've got a mix where you've got the P&C, especially in Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of Switzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have – or are still in that place in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shift or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, going into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024, really, it will depend on the rate path.– closing remarks Okay. Looks like there are no more questions. Thank you for being with us this morning. As I said, despite the very uncertain market conditions, we delivered solid underlying results for the quarter. We have been maintaining our capital and liquidity positions, and we were also able to get very close to resolve a legacy matter that has been with us for 15 years. We discussed also the unique opportunity that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents not only for our shareholders, but I believe also for all the rest of our stakeholders, employees, clients, society at large. And of course, this is not going to be a straight line journey. You know, it's going to be a challenging one, is a complex one. But I do believe that, you know, the benefits outweigh by far, all those factors. So, I know that you are looking for more details. We are also you are looking for more details. And we will really do our best to keep the communication channels open over the next few weeks and months so that we can provide the necessary information to have a better understanding of this great equity story ahead of us. Thank you.\n",

            "Hi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for this year in your guidance. If that was zero, what would that – or how would that alter your guidance? And then secondly, on the treatment of software intangibles, I suppose it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a benefit relative to your European peers. I mean, if you were to align the rules with Europe, what sort of impact would that have on your capital? Thank you.Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "So, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory framework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms, but also vis-à-vis the European peers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital base. Hey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar rate cuts. If there were fewer than those – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes, that would be corrected to be upside. If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or two on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client behavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that – likely to be some degree of upside, all other things equal.Thank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and Todd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters;

            "Hi. Thank you so much for your questions. My first one is on wealth management. Just wanted to get a sense on you know how you are assessing you know the business overlaps in that segment – in that segment or you've had you know further chance to sort of you know look at you know different regions and how to respond to all the ongoing competitive pressures and in terms of you know relationship managers and then sort of bankers in that segment? So, if you could give a bit of an update on that side? And then the second one is on the investment bank, the CS non-core perimeter of 55 billion. I know in one of your slides have provided a natural run-off rate, but I was just trying to get a sense if you could provide any sort of color in terms of what is your sort of ambition on actively winding down this perimeter in terms of timeline, i.e. could we expect you know the next two years basically by 2025 you know broadly most of this run down to be done. Is that is that a fair assumption or are you looking at it in a bit of a different way? Thank you so much.Okay. Thank you so much.\n",
            "Hey, Vishal. I mean I think on this on that second question, we've addressed that in the sense that you know we offer the natural rundown just given you know of course, we have to take care and ensure that we're protecting our counterparties and we're doing things in the best interests of the firm and so on these positions that we, you know, we will look – we will look strategically to exit them as quickly as possible. But at this point, I would say, we'll come back and give you progress as we've done already in 2Q in terms of the actual RWA reduction relative to the natural runoff profile. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent we can give more color through our planning process, we will. But again, these are positions where we think, naturally, there'll be strategic exits and opportunities that arise and not something we'll, I will be disclosing. In terms of your first question on Wealth Management and assessing business overlaps, I mean, in general, the way we approach the integration is to look at Credit Suisse is adding value in a lot of the areas in which we already operate. But also, as Sergio mentioned, areas where we have less of a presence. Brazil was mentioned. There are important parts of the Middle East where that's the case; important parts of Southeast Asia. Also, much bigger in Europe overall. So, in terms of assessing the overlaps, I mean, in the end of the day, relationship managers have their client relationships and we want to retain them all. And of course, we're looking at how to manage the business in the most efficient and effective way. I would make one additional comment which is very important, which is that Iqbal had announced the area market heads on a combined basis, and that was very important just in the last several weeks and was in comments Sergio made as well, because when we start integrating how we approach the market and so we're in the market on an integrated basis, which, of course, just took time even though we move quickly in the two and a half months since we've closed, to be in the market on an integrated basis having market heads that have now been decided across wealth management on a combined and integrated basis is quite a step that helps us to manage some of the business overlaps and competitive pressures that you were asking about.Okay. The last answer and questions and I'm sure we're going to have a chance to stay in touch between now and November 7th when we announce the Q3 results. For the time being, thank you for dialing in. Thanks for your questions. And well as I say, looking forward to staying in touch. Thank you.\n",

            "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just – what do you assume in terms of loan and deposit growth in the Swiss business NII guide and your GWM growth in the second half of the year? And then secondly, how do you see deposit mix shift and deposit betas evolving within that guide as well? Thank you.Thank you.\n",
            "Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of – in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.Okay, there are no more questions. Thank you all for calling in and your questions. And see you in end of October for the Q3 results. Thank you. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including elevated inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters;

            "Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me. So, on profitability, clearly better than expected in the quarter. Previously, you'd guided for positive underlying PBT in H2 and breakeven in the third quarter. So, given the third quarter is already quite positive, does that change how we should think about Q4? I guess the old guidance implied a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of PBT. So just wondering whether that's still the right way to think about that. And then, second, and I appreciate it's a bit of a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on CS net new money. You've given the regional disclosure on a combined basis, but I just wanted to check whether the combined regional picture, sort of Asia strong, EMEA strong, Switzerland more balanced. Is that consistent across both the CS and UBS Wealth franchises?Thanks, Todd. Helpful.\n",
            "Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look – meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.\n",

            "Good morning, guys. Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third – in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\n",
            " Yeah. Hi, Piers. So on the second look, you know, Sergio and I have said consistently that in NCL we're going to prioritize cost takeout in the way we think about de-risking the book. That still is the team's focus. You know, it's had a great run and continued to do so in 3Q with de-risking another 5 billion of RWA, you know, so I mean, I wouldn't necessarily draw conclusions other than to say that the pace that they were running at is a pace that would be very hard to sustain, given that we had, you know, we articulated ambitions for the end of 2026 that they've been making quick work at. But – and we'll come back and re-guide as I mentioned in my comments in 4Q about how we see the next two years. But certainly you, you can't draw a straight line from the performance that they've had, you know, live-to-date. In terms of the Banking performance in the quarter. Look, I still think it was a good performance. It outperformed the fee pool. We had a very strong first half of the year. 2Q was exceptionally strong. We had a bit of bring forward as well of some deals that we were able to get done in 2Q. And probably had the inverse dynamic happening in 3Q, where we had some deals, you know, pushed into the fourth quarter and those deals on the margin can make a difference on the performance in the comparative. But we remain very, very bullish on the pipeline. You know, naturally, of course, the uncertainties that we highlighted in our comments about 4Q, you know, are clearly potential issues to navigate, i.e. the US elections, other geopolitical concerns and tensions that may impact on banking overall. But I think, you know, we're going to continue to gain market share. And, you know, we're bullish on Banking's ability to execute on its pipeline.Todd, I would only maybe add to that. From a comparison standpoint of view, it's worthwhile to note that strategically we are underweight in debt capital markets. So, in a sense, when you look at the performance, you have to look at the third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for debt capital markets. So I think that we are very happy with the developments that we've seen in Banking and the ability to win mandates. Now, of course, we need to see if we can execute it if the market will – if the market will be there, but just very, very confident that it's a good momentum. So that was the last question so thanks for dialing in and for your questions and we'll catch up in February for the Q4 results, and we're going to give you also an update on our 2025 and 2026 journey. Thank you.

I know you've taken a lot of adjustments on CS acquisition and you've gotten the $4 billion of balance sheet reserves at this stage, but having had a good chance to look at the case book at this point. Is there anything in there which you think might still burden the P&L over the course of the targets that you’ve laid out this morning? Thanks.\n",
            "Hey, Piers. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I mean, just refer you to the litigation note which, you know, gives both the UBS heritage and Credit Suisse heritage legacies there, say that's the best bet. Otherwise, I’ll just tell you that our provision levels are augmented by the PPA that I described in August. We're comfortable with the levels we're at just given the – where those matters sit, but that's, you know, all I would comment in terms of litigation at this stage.I won't abuse of your patience. You have been with us, thank you, for 2 hours-plus. Thanks for the questions. Thanks for attending. I hope you got enough information. But most importantly, if you have any further needs or any further questions, please reach out to Sarah's team, IR, or I'm sure between myself and Todd, we'll have a chance to catch-up with many of you in the next few weeks. Thank you for attending and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements This transcript contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the Risk Factors filed on Form 6-K with the 2Q23 UBS Group AG report on 31 August 2023 and the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n",

            "Yes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow-ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the message correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep accounts and obviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, you're little bit below street expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just appetite for re-leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you comment that, please? And then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no change to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your favor on implementation of Basel III final that's caused a delta? Thanks.That's perfect. Thanks. Just on global banking, you mentioned a 20% change in pipeline, was it up or down? I didn't catch that.21, okay. So in any case, to handle in front so...Ok, Thanks very much\n",
            "Hi Piers, so on – I'll just take your second question first. So in terms of the Basel III, look, I guided down last quarter to a lower level than I had been guiding. You know, as we started to get more visibility and make progress, the team has done an excellent job at ensuring that we were able to mitigate where we can in some of the aspects that were at work or infrastructure improvements, model alignments, also exiting positions and running down risks. So all of those things contributed to our ability to be able to, you know, ultimately print the day-one level that's far inside where we had guided. In terms of re-leveraging opportunities, you know, for sure in Global Wealth Management with rates, you know, potentially higher, you know, we're not or not going, coming down as quickly as perhaps we anticipated a quarter ago or certainly two quarters ago. You know, that's going to be helpful. That's going to be helpful for deposit margins as I mentioned, but probably, we'll have a little bit of a chilling effect on re-leveraging, which is something that with rates coming down, we expect to see both in, you know, in all parts of the of the wealth business, which involves really where we have US dollar exposure in the US business naturally, but also in our APAC part of the business. And so we, you know, if rates sort of back up, then we'll have positive effects on deposit margins, but the extent of re-leveraging that we're pricing into the outlook, you know, we may see that come in less aggressively.What we mentioned, it's not our pipeline. What we said is that according to market data. So the industry is down 26% year-to-date [Edit 21%], so for the first month. So our pipeline is building up. We are very confident about the ability to generate new business and build up our market share. But you know, if you look at according to market data, January, on January, you know, the amount of fees and activity is down 26% [Edit 21%] if I remember correctly.So yeah, it came in – the final number came in, yes, sorry, Piers, I got your question. The fee pool is down around 21 percentage for January.Exactly.So that's industry and not UBS. Just to be clear.Okay. So there are no more questions. There are no more questions. So thank you for calling in and for your questions. So I'll touch base next quarter. Thank you.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of \\u2013 in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on Investment Bank. If you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to $200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of risk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified platform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse bankers you onboarded, pretty low revenues so far. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the markets position that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse colleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they could see an acceleration this year. Thank you.Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it's very early and I guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stones that we should look out for before you can resume a buyback? That's my first question. And then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs and the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? Can we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is the legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in \\u201825 versus \\u201824? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the \\u201824 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well? Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.\",\n          \"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don\\u2019t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it\\u2019s not \\u2013 we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that \\u2013 i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I\\u2019m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over \\u2013 if, assuming they do \\u2013 over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.\",\n          \"Thanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mentioned in my remarks, certainly the elevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre-tax at the moment, in particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we're not able to offset \\u2013 even within the jurisdictions - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they fall out. So there could be expenses or losses in one entity that's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating taxable profits. And that's indeed what's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entities in particular, as you'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are separate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happening on the CS AG side that you would otherwise ideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn't happening until we start the mergers. Now, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it's gradual? We'll see both. I mean, certainly we'll see some immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder planning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you\\u2019ll see once the mergers take place over the course of 2024, you'll see some step down. But you'll also, as I said, gradually see the rate come back in. In terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess of USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We're undertaking actions at present. We haven't quantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on Investment Bank. If you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to $200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of risk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified platform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse bankers you onboarded, pretty low revenues so far. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the markets position that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse colleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they could see an acceleration this year. Thank you.Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it's very early and I guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stones that we should look out for before you can resume a buyback? That's my first question. And then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs and the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? Can we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is the legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in \\u201825 versus \\u201824? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the \\u201824 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well? Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.\",\n          \"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don\\u2019t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it\\u2019s not \\u2013 we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that \\u2013 i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I\\u2019m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over \\u2013 if, assuming they do \\u2013 over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.\",\n          \"Thanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mentioned in my remarks, certainly the elevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre-tax at the moment, in particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we're not able to offset \\u2013 even within the jurisdictions - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they fall out. So there could be expenses or losses in one entity that's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating taxable profits. And that's indeed what's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entities in particular, as you'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are separate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happening on the CS AG side that you would otherwise ideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn't happening until we start the mergers. Now, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it's gradual? We'll see both. I mean, certainly we'll see some immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder planning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you\\u2019ll see once the mergers take place over the course of 2024, you'll see some step down. But you'll also, as I said, gradually see the rate come back in. In terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess of USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We're undertaking actions at present. We haven't quantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on Investment Bank. If you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to $200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of risk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified platform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse bankers you onboarded, pretty low revenues so far. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the markets position that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse colleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they could see an acceleration this year. Thank you.Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it's very early and I guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stones that we should look out for before you can resume a buyback? That's my first question. And then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs and the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? Can we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is the legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in \\u201825 versus \\u201824? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the \\u201824 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well? Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.\",\n          \"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don\\u2019t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it\\u2019s not \\u2013 we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that \\u2013 i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I\\u2019m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over \\u2013 if, assuming they do \\u2013 over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.\",\n          \"Thanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mentioned in my remarks, certainly the elevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre-tax at the moment, in particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we're not able to offset \\u2013 even within the jurisdictions - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they fall out. So there could be expenses or losses in one entity that's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating taxable profits. And that's indeed what's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entities in particular, as you'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are separate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happening on the CS AG side that you would otherwise ideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn't happening until we start the mergers. Now, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it's gradual? We'll see both. I mean, certainly we'll see some immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder planning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you\\u2019ll see once the mergers take place over the course of 2024, you'll see some step down. But you'll also, as I said, gradually see the rate come back in. In terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess of USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We're undertaking actions at present. We haven't quantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on Investment Bank. If you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to $200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of risk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified platform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse bankers you onboarded, pretty low revenues so far. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the markets position that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse colleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they could see an acceleration this year. Thank you.Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it's very early and I guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stones that we should look out for before you can resume a buyback? That's my first question. And then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs and the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? Can we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is the legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, so good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me. So 2025 profitability, you've guided for high single-digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9%. You're already at 9.2% in the nine-month stage this year. So how should we be thinking about the outlook for returns and earnings growth in \\u201825 versus \\u201824? And also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the \\u201824 return on core tier 1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year? And then second, and again, it's a bit of a follow up on US wealth. So 12% pre-tax margin in the quarter, are there any one-offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring, you know, a broader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin up towards the mid-teens target. What are the key signposts we should look out for you to sort of be delivering on that strategy? And given the comments yesterday from Colm on M&A, how does M&A fit into that strategy as well? Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Analyst_Bank\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9nerale\",\n          \"I\\u2019ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better\",\n          \"Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long-term, that's for sure the case in the short-term, i.e. the 2H guidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some modest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.\",\n          \"Benjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don\\u2019t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any numbers that has been flagged out there. So it\\u2019s not \\u2013 we are not in a position to understand where and how those numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.Yeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of that is market driven and some of that \\u2013 i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource optimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing, to the extent it is the latter, we are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I\\u2019m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that respect, because we're improving the revenue over RWA consideration. But obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet some reticence to re-lever in some of our regions. So I expect that we won't have a lot of momentum on re- levering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down, over \\u2013 if, assuming they do \\u2013 over the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be, to me, a big driver in terms of releverage.\",\n          \"Thanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mentioned in my remarks, certainly the elevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre-tax at the moment, in particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we're not able to offset \\u2013 even within the jurisdictions - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they fall out. So there could be expenses or losses in one entity that's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating taxable profits. And that's indeed what's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entities in particular, as you'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are separate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happening on the CS AG side that you would otherwise ideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn't happening until we start the mergers. Now, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it's gradual? We'll see both. I mean, certainly we'll see some immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder planning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you\\u2019ll see once the mergers take place over the course of 2024, you'll see some step down. But you'll also, as I said, gradually see the rate come back in. In terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess of USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We're undertaking actions at present. We haven't quantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
