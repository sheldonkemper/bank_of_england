And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of \\u2013 in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

            "Hi. Good morning. And welcome back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the more integrated disclosure on the beta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly from the U.S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some color on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024. And then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the perimeter of what mean – of what goes into non-core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few years now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS lumps with IBD. I guess the question is how do you see that business within your IB structure?\n",
            "Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take the second question. I think that, yes, the DNA won't change what we do is part of the equation and having a diversified portfolio of businesses does include also having leverage finance. Of course, we are – we will stay very focused on how we are present in that business. We want to be meaningful to our clients, but also to be mindful that you know, this cannot be the driver of the profitability of the investment bank with all associated, you know, volatility and risks. So, you can count on us, or our clients can count on us being a relevant player, but definitely, we are not – our ambition is not to be at the top of the league just for – and to make it a central part of our model. So, expect at the margins a little bit more, but in a very, very focused way. And we will also look at ways to be creative around that business, because there are opportunities for us to also partner with other institutions on how to manage, you know residual risk. So, our ability has to be to be the bridge in the investment bank between different sources of capital and not necessarily originate and store risks.In terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, first of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or below the modelled beta. But then what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which are yielding those higher overall, on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we are in the cycle. So in the U.S. where those very high rates where we are at very high incremental betas. And that's continuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in Europe, we went from being really at fairly low levels to – now moving into a place where there is price sensitivity, especially for GWM clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit of mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix shift there. And then on – in Switzerland, you've got a mix where you've got the P&C, especially in Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of Switzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have – or are still in that place in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shift or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, going into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024, really, it will depend on the rate path.– closing remarks Okay. Looks like there are no more questions. Thank you for being with us this morning. As I said, despite the very uncertain market conditions, we delivered solid underlying results for the quarter. We have been maintaining our capital and liquidity positions, and we were also able to get very close to resolve a legacy matter that has been with us for 15 years. We discussed also the unique opportunity that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents not only for our shareholders, but I believe also for all the rest of our stakeholders, employees, clients, society at large. And of course, this is not going to be a straight line journey. You know, it's going to be a challenging one, is a complex one. But I do believe that, you know, the benefits outweigh by far, all those factors. So, I know that you are looking for more details. We are also you are looking for more details. And we will really do our best to keep the communication channels open over the next few weeks and months so that we can provide the necessary information to have a better understanding of this great equity story ahead of us.

            "Hi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for this year in your guidance. If that was zero, what would that – or how would that alter your guidance? And then secondly, on the treatment of software intangibles, I suppose it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a benefit relative to your European peers. I mean, if you were to align the rules with Europe, what sort of impact would that have on your capital? Thank you.Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "So, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory framework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms, but also vis-à-vis the European peers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital base. Hey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar rate cuts. If there were fewer than those – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes, that would be corrected to be upside. If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or two on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client behavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that – likely to be some degree of upside, all other things equal.Thank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and Todd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results.\n",

            "Hi. Thank you so much for your questions. My first one is on wealth management. Just wanted to get a sense on you know how you are assessing you know the business overlaps in that segment – in that segment or you've had you know further chance to sort of you know look at you know different regions and how to respond to all the ongoing competitive pressures and in terms of you know relationship managers and then sort of bankers in that segment? So, if you could give a bit of an update on that side? And then the second one is on the investment bank, the CS non-core perimeter of 55 billion. I know in one of your slides have provided a natural run-off rate, but I was just trying to get a sense if you could provide any sort of color in terms of what is your sort of ambition on actively winding down this perimeter in terms of timeline, i.e. could we expect you know the next two years basically by 2025 you know broadly most of this run down to be done. Is that is that a fair assumption or are you looking at it in a bit of a different way? Thank you so much.Okay. Thank you so much.\n",
            "Hey, Vishal. I mean I think on this on that second question, we've addressed that in the sense that you know we offer the natural rundown just given you know of course, we have to take care and ensure that we're protecting our counterparties and we're doing things in the best interests of the firm and so on these positions that we, you know, we will look – we will look strategically to exit them as quickly as possible. But at this point, I would say, we'll come back and give you progress as we've done already in 2Q in terms of the actual RWA reduction relative to the natural runoff profile. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent we can give more color through our planning process, we will. But again, these are positions where we think, naturally, there'll be strategic exits and opportunities that arise and not something we'll, I will be disclosing. In terms of your first question on Wealth Management and assessing business overlaps, I mean, in general, the way we approach the integration is to look at Credit Suisse is adding value in a lot of the areas in which we already operate. But also, as Sergio mentioned, areas where we have less of a presence. Brazil was mentioned. There are important parts of the Middle East where that's the case; important parts of Southeast Asia. Also, much bigger in Europe overall. So, in terms of assessing the overlaps, I mean, in the end of the day, relationship managers have their client relationships and we want to retain them all. And of course, we're looking at how to manage the business in the most efficient and effective way. I would make one additional comment which is very important, which is that Iqbal had announced the area market heads on a combined basis, and that was very important just in the last several weeks and was in comments Sergio made as well, because when we start integrating how we approach the market and so we're in the market on an integrated basis, which, of course, just took time even though we move quickly in the two and a half months since we've closed, to be in the market on an integrated basis having market heads that have now been decided across wealth management on a combined and integrated basis is quite a step that helps us to manage some of the business overlaps and competitive pressures that you were asking about.Okay. The last answer and questions and I'm sure we're going to have a chance to stay in touch between now and November 7th when we announce the Q3 results. For the time being, thank you for dialing in. Thanks for your questions. And well as I say, looking forward to staying in touch. Thank you.\n",

            "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just – what do you assume in terms of loan and deposit growth in the Swiss business NII guide and your GWM growth in the second half of the year? And then secondly, how do you see deposit mix shift and deposit betas evolving within that guide as well? Thank you.Thank you.\n",
            "Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of – in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.Okay, there are no more questions. Thank you all for calling in and your questions. And see you in end of October for the Q3 results.

            "Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me. So, on profitability, clearly better than expected in the quarter. Previously, you'd guided for positive underlying PBT in H2 and breakeven in the third quarter. So, given the third quarter is already quite positive, does that change how we should think about Q4? I guess the old guidance implied a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of PBT. So just wondering whether that's still the right way to think about that. And then, second, and I appreciate it's a bit of a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on CS net new money. You've given the regional disclosure on a combined basis, but I just wanted to check whether the combined regional picture, sort of Asia strong, EMEA strong, Switzerland more balanced. Is that consistent across both the CS and UBS Wealth franchises?Thanks, Todd. Helpful.\n",
            "Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look – meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.\n",

            "Good morning, guys. Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third – in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\n",
            " Yeah. Hi, Piers. So on the second look, you know, Sergio and I have said consistently that in NCL we're going to prioritize cost takeout in the way we think about de-risking the book. That still is the team's focus. You know, it's had a great run and continued to do so in 3Q with de-risking another 5 billion of RWA, you know, so I mean, I wouldn't necessarily draw conclusions other than to say that the pace that they were running at is a pace that would be very hard to sustain, given that we had, you know, we articulated ambitions for the end of 2026 that they've been making quick work at. But – and we'll come back and re-guide as I mentioned in my comments in 4Q about how we see the next two years. But certainly you, you can't draw a straight line from the performance that they've had, you know, live-to-date. In terms of the Banking performance in the quarter. Look, I still think it was a good performance. It outperformed the fee pool. We had a very strong first half of the year. 2Q was exceptionally strong. We had a bit of bring forward as well of some deals that we were able to get done in 2Q. And probably had the inverse dynamic happening in 3Q, where we had some deals, you know, pushed into the fourth quarter and those deals on the margin can make a difference on the performance in the comparative. But we remain very, very bullish on the pipeline. You know, naturally, of course, the uncertainties that we highlighted in our comments about 4Q, you know, are clearly potential issues to navigate, i.e. the US elections, other geopolitical concerns and tensions that may impact on banking overall. But I think, you know, we're going to continue to gain market share. And, you know, we're bullish on Banking's ability to execute on its pipeline.Todd, I would only maybe add to that. From a comparison standpoint of view, it's worthwhile to note that strategically we are underweight in debt capital markets. So, in a sense, when you look at the performance, you have to look at the third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for debt capital markets. So I think that we are very happy with the developments that we've seen in Banking and the ability to win mandates. Now, of course, we need to see if we can execute it if the market will – if the market will be there, but just very, very confident that it's a good momentum. So that was the last question so thanks for dialing in and for your questions and we'll catch up in February for the Q4 results, and we're going to give you also an update on our 2025 and 2026 journey. Thank you.\n",

            "Yeah. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a final one on litigation. Just whether there's anything in the plan for a sort of a business as usual normalized charge for litigation. I know you've taken a lot of adjustments on CS acquisition and you've gotten the $4 billion of balance sheet reserves at this stage, but having had a good chance to look at the case book at this point. Is there anything in there which you think might still burden the P&L over the course of the targets that you’ve laid out this morning? Thanks.\n",
            "Hey, Piers. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I mean, just refer you to the litigation note which, you know, gives both the UBS heritage and Credit Suisse heritage legacies there, say that's the best bet. Otherwise, I’ll just tell you that our provision levels are augmented by the PPA that I described in August. We're comfortable with the levels we're at just given the – where those matters sit, but that's, you know, all I would comment in terms of litigation at this stage.I won't abuse of your patience. You have been with us, thank you, for 2 hours-plus. Thanks for the questions. Thanks for attending. I hope you got enough information. But most importantly, if you have any further needs or any further questions, please reach out to Sarah's team, IR, or I'm sure between myself and Todd, we'll have a chance to catch-up with many of you in the next few weeks. Thank you for attending and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.\n",

            "Yes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow-ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the message correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep accounts and obviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, you're little bit below street expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just appetite for re-leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you comment that, please? And then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no change to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your favor on implementation of Basel III final that's caused a delta? Thanks.That's perfect. Thanks. Just on global banking, you mentioned a 20% change in pipeline, was it up or down? I didn't catch that.21, okay. So in any case, to handle in front so...Ok, Thanks very much\n",
            "Hi Piers, so on – I'll just take your second question first. So in terms of the Basel III, look, I guided down last quarter to a lower level than I had been guiding. You know, as we started to get more visibility and make progress, the team has done an excellent job at ensuring that we were able to mitigate where we can in some of the aspects that were at work or infrastructure improvements, model alignments, also exiting positions and running down risks. So all of those things contributed to our ability to be able to, you know, ultimately print the day-one level that's far inside where we had guided. In terms of re-leveraging opportunities, you know, for sure in Global Wealth Management with rates, you know, potentially higher, you know, we're not or not going, coming down as quickly as perhaps we anticipated a quarter ago or certainly two quarters ago. You know, that's going to be helpful. That's going to be helpful for deposit margins as I mentioned, but probably, we'll have a little bit of a chilling effect on re-leveraging, which is something that with rates coming down, we expect to see both in, you know, in all parts of the of the wealth business, which involves really where we have US dollar exposure in the US business naturally, but also in our APAC part of the business. And so we, you know, if rates sort of back up, then we'll have positive effects on deposit margins, but the extent of re-leveraging that we're pricing into the outlook, you know, we may see that come in less aggressively.What we mentioned, it's not our pipeline. What we said is that according to market data. So the industry is down 26% year-to-date [Edit 21%], so for the first month. So our pipeline is building up. We are very confident about the ability to generate new business and build up our market share. But you know, if you look at according to market data, January, on January, you know, the amount of fees and activity is down 26% [Edit 21%] if I remember correctly.So yeah, it came in – the final number came in, yes, sorry, Piers, I got your question. The fee pool is down around 21 percentage for January.Exactly.So that's industry and not UBS. Just to be clear.Okay. So there are no more questions. There are no more questions. So thank you for calling in and for your questions. So I'll touch base next quarter. Thank you.\n",

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of \\u2013 in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans in both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet work that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well through on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year. I mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this year but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in terms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing. On a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid-term in terms of the balance sheet. And in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many banks have the effects of deposit mix and cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as rates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact in terms of the NII. And, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and are modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as while rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third \\u2013 in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we\\u2019re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.Brilliant. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third \\u2013 in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we\\u2019re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.Brilliant. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third \\u2013 in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we\\u2019re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.Brilliant. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome. And so we're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three- year plan in a way that reflects win-backs and organic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just got two questions. One is a follow-up on the previous investment bank question. But in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year-over-year momentum, but much weaker quarter-on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're thinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of further volatility? And then the second question is on NCL so, again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, you're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third \\u2013 in the first quarter. So would it be fair to draw from that, that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly limited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the math that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision-making process. So, if you look at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post-Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate $46 billion of revenues, 70% cost income, $32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full year 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs, appreciate we\\u2019re comparing exit versus full year there. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities given that you previously said $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are sacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also, where you've made the decision to perhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question. Second question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot of excess capital there, then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are there any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the FINMA waiver between tangible equity and core Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.It's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.That's great. Perhaps I could just follow-up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation was wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post-Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post-Basel IV finalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% on the slide? Just to be clear.Brilliant.

So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Yes. I mean, in terms of the non-core, I don't think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do \\u2013 as Todd mentioned before, we need to look at \\u2013 in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, we will need to make an assessment about what we think is the value of those positions. But I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what we expected because we didn't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are confident that the quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non-core assets per se. The vast majority is not problematic and therefore I'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned before, it's more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the assets themselves. In terms of recovery of the funds, we see a \\u2013 the win-back strategy is still in place. We have been \\u2013 we are \\u2013 very focused. And probably what I can offer as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the second quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in the third quarter. Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client advisors from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to be moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more than 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it's very difficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them. So if you look at the numbers, it's quite \\u2013 I can give you maybe a little bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we lost around \\u2013 or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD 20 billions of assets. So \\u2013 and let's say that we we're going to lose further assets because some of those people just left more recently, and we're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced that it's not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to recapture some of it. So, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the instability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we're going to formulate these ambitions, as Todd mentioned, as a combined wealth management business going forward because, I mean, it's not really an issue any longer, Credit Suisse versus UBS, it\\u2019s one team. We are working on maximizing the outcome.
