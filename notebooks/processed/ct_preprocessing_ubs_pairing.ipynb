In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And from there onwards, we will look into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of\\u2026, going forward. And most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part of our offering. The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may have different views on certain client segments or people. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"So in respect of what you mentioned and changes in the law or regulations around liquidity. I think I can only say that it's pretty difficult to track all the rumors, speculations and ideas that are coming up, almost daily. On the Swiss media, I think that I can only tell you that, that at this stage what stands is that even the Finance Minister took an official stance on the matter. I mean, those are speculations. I don't believe this is going to be part of the package. I think that - I'm convinced that Switzerland will keep its standards in terms of allowing \\u2013 or responding to the crisis in March, not only the one in Switzerland, but broadly speaking, with following the recommendation that it will be set by the FSB and other bodies. And in that sense, I don't see us being particularly disadvantaged compared to any other jurisdictions in terms of a Liquidity Ordinance. So, I guess that we will follow up and I think it's going to still take months and months before the full analysis of what happened will translate into concrete actions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan']\",\n          \"['Anke Reingen, RBC']\",\n          \"['Amit Goel, Mediobanca']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Barclays\",\n          \"JP\",\n          \"KBW\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 88,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes. Morning. I have two questions, please. Two on Wealth Management. The first one would be on your pre-tax profit margin targets in the US. You're targeting mid-teens by 2026 and still significantly below what your US peers are doing. So, I wanted to know what kind of levers you can pull through to have this convergence towards the profitability levels that we are seeing of the US peers. And the second one will be on the net inflow that you are targeting. Is there any geographies where you see the most potential or where you are the most excited about where you \\u2013 where the CS merger is bringing new capabilities and new outlook? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to go back actually to some of the elements you have discussed on this call already, especially the NCL. Maybe trying to help us understand how much of the ROCET1 improvement towards 2026 is going to be driven by this unit, considering our move to natural runoff here, you know, trying to help us assess already at this stage what \\u2013 how loss-making it is today and how loss- making it would end up being in 2026, only considering the natural runoff. And then the other question I wanted to raise is on the cost save. Just to make sure I understand correctly. So you basically have already a target of 3 billion cost saves on an annualized run rate at the end of this year. But this is compared to the end of 2022, I think. So, how much of the annualized 3 billion do you kind of already have, you know, in the 2Q accounts, please? Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 88,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \"Thanks, Flora. So, in terms of, I'll take, maybe address the second point first. In terms of the cost saves in the \\u2013 in terms of what we're projecting by the end of the year at 3 billion. In terms of what we see already in the second quarter, we haven't disclosed that specific number. But I think from just the head count reductions that I mentioned in my remarks, you could probably consider that there's somewhere more than, around half has already started to hit through, and what we're already seeing in our underlying results. In terms of our CET1 and how to think about NCL as we go through the process. For sure, NCL is, you know, is going to be something that weighs down on our CET1 naturally Just given the fact that, you know, we have significant, at least over the 2024 to 2026 period. If you just look at the natural profile rundown, which is effectively basis for how we started thinking about the RoCET,1 not the only way we started to model it, but, for sure, one of the ways that we were thinking about it. There's a drag by definition in the sense that, by the end of 2026, you could see in the slide the natural profile has roughly half going away. Now, we can model different scenarios as can you, but we're not going to discuss how we're thinking about it and obviously, some of that is still very much unknown. In terms of the cost takeout, we would expect to be taking out the lion's share of the costs in non-core and legacy by the time the integration is materially complete, by definition. We will do that. There\\u2019ll be, we expect some residual carry that we'll have to take on or continue to run down beyond 2026. So, there is some, if you will, negative burn that is associated with NCL in our modeling.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Yes, hi. Good morning. So two questions from me. Todd, you mentioned some balance sheet optimization efforts that have lifted revenues over RWAs by 3 percentage points. I was wondering if you could shed some light on, you know, these measures and how much is left to come? I think in Q4, you highlighted some NII [Edit NNA] impact, and I was wondering how much of that has already come through? And then aside from the quarter, and going back to the US wealth business, in my understanding, once you get to 15% PBT and once you have done with the CS integration, you could consider some inorganic growth opportunity to further improve margins. But isn't this at odds with the Too Big to Fail proposal the way it is written at the moment, which sort of penalizes growth in foreign subsidiaries? And how do you square the two?

Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on risk weighted assets. You have around USD 557 billion, USD 145 billion operational risk weighted assets. And I'm just wondering how we should think about the exit run rates in 2026 in terms of total risk weighted assets as well as in terms of operational risk weighted assets if I may. And then the second question is related to the non- core. Could you talk a little bit about the P&L effects of the non-core ex any more active write-downs or sales, so to say, leading to potential write-downs? I'm just trying to understand the P&L in terms of run rate of the noncore legacy bank, if I may. Thank you.Morgan Okay. Thank you. If I may just very briefly on the risk weighted assets, if I \\u2013 to take a very simplistic view and I just assume. I know the runoff, I can make some assumptions about Basel IV then op risk which is clearly very difficult to predict if I want to be conservative. One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets conservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hi Kian. In terms of the op risk RWA, we will come back next quarter after doing a fair bit of additional modeling in terms of the op risk RWA of the combined bank. We've started to have initial views on that and initial discussions with our regulators and that informed the 10 billion reduction that I spoke about in my comments. And then, in terms of the trajectory and how we think about the 5.57 towards 2026, you'll have more color on that after we complete the business planning process and our 3 YSP and come back early next year as mentioned. In terms of, you asked about the P&L and the run rate in non-core. So, what I would say on that is. So first off, the thing that's most important is to take costs out and to focus very significantly on the cost takeout because there's a significant level of overhead and costs that aren't associated with the wind down of the portfolio. So, the way to think about it is that we have emphasized so far today that we have to take costs out and effectively, the costs that sit in parts of Credit Suisse that don't work. And so, those costs, whether they be personnel costs or whether they be technology costs or real estate costs, they move into non-core and legacy if they don't support the core businesses and they have to be run down extremely quickly. And so, I would say, first and foremost, it's a cost. The way to think about it is the cost rundown over the integration timeline. Then there's the asset rundown and we talked about the trajectory from a natural rundown perspective. And of course as Sergio mentioned that there will be strategically and actively looking at that. And of course from that perspective, we have taken some PPA adjustments in excess of USD 5 billion relating to non-core and legacy. I think that's a useful way to think about it too, the fact that some of that pulls to par and some of that will be fair value positions. And we will manage that book in the most capital efficient way that we can and dispose of positions as appropriate. And also keeping just considering funding costs and the costs of operations, technology, people, etc.Kian, its, you know, we can't really comment right now. We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 124,\n        \"min\": 21,\n        \"max\": 1042,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          91\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Yes, hi. Good morning. So two questions from me. Todd, you mentioned some balance sheet optimization efforts that have lifted revenues over RWAs by 3 percentage points. I was wondering if you could shed some light on, you know, these measures and how much is left to come? I think in Q4, you highlighted some NII [Edit NNA] impact, and I was wondering how much of that has already come through? And then aside from the quarter, and going back to the US wealth business, in my understanding, once you get to 15% PBT and once you have done with the CS integration, you could consider some inorganic growth opportunity to further improve margins. But isn't this at odds with the Too Big to Fail proposal the way it is written at the moment, which sort of penalizes growth in foreign subsidiaries? And how do you square the two?

Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on risk weighted assets. You have around USD 557 billion, USD 145 billion operational risk weighted assets. And I'm just wondering how we should think about the exit run rates in 2026 in terms of total risk weighted assets as well as in terms of operational risk weighted assets if I may. And then the second question is related to the non- core. Could you talk a little bit about the P&L effects of the non-core ex any more active write-downs or sales, so to say, leading to potential write-downs? I'm just trying to understand the P&L in terms of run rate of the noncore legacy bank, if I may. Thank you.Morgan Okay. Thank you. If I may just very briefly on the risk weighted assets, if I \\u2013 to take a very simplistic view and I just assume. I know the runoff, I can make some assumptions about Basel IV then op risk which is clearly very difficult to predict if I want to be conservative. One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets conservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hi Kian. In terms of the op risk RWA, we will come back next quarter after doing a fair bit of additional modeling in terms of the op risk RWA of the combined bank. We've started to have initial views on that and initial discussions with our regulators and that informed the 10 billion reduction that I spoke about in my comments. And then, in terms of the trajectory and how we think about the 5.57 towards 2026, you'll have more color on that after we complete the business planning process and our 3 YSP and come back early next year as mentioned. In terms of, you asked about the P&L and the run rate in non-core. So, what I would say on that is. So first off, the thing that's most important is to take costs out and to focus very significantly on the cost takeout because there's a significant level of overhead and costs that aren't associated with the wind down of the portfolio. So, the way to think about it is that we have emphasized so far today that we have to take costs out and effectively, the costs that sit in parts of Credit Suisse that don't work. And so, those costs, whether they be personnel costs or whether they be technology costs or real estate costs, they move into non-core and legacy if they don't support the core businesses and they have to be run down extremely quickly. And so, I would say, first and foremost, it's a cost. The way to think about it is the cost rundown over the integration timeline. Then there's the asset rundown and we talked about the trajectory from a natural rundown perspective. And of course as Sergio mentioned that there will be strategically and actively looking at that. And of course from that perspective, we have taken some PPA adjustments in excess of USD 5 billion relating to non-core and legacy. I think that's a useful way to think about it too, the fact that some of that pulls to par and some of that will be fair value positions. And we will manage that book in the most capital efficient way that we can and dispose of positions as appropriate. And also keeping just considering funding costs and the costs of operations, technology, people, etc.Kian, its, you know, we can't really comment right now. We are modeling. We are really going through the details of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put together legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation. So, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk-weighted assets going forward because one, there are two elements \\u2013 well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some adjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk was one of these subjects. But then you need to go through, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency on optimizing legal entity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to grow, as well. And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a risk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4, for the Q4 results.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 124,\n        \"min\": 21,\n        \"max\": 1042,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          91\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
