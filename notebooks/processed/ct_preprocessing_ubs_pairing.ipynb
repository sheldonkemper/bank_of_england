In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back. So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring to fruits.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they may be linked. The first regarding the outstanding SNB funding. I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January?

Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these assets back.

I don't think there's any update in the disclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here? And possibly related to this, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction of SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any connection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has come into play \\u2013 that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how your liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, please? Thank you.\",\n          \"I'm sorry, speaking Q-on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%.

Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"analyst\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"exective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you ran ahead of plan in 2024, clearly, the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected, but on the other hand, you're also guiding to around an extra 1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on returns. So, I guess, to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration has now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e. have we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform here over the next couple of years? And then second, on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no material and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that such changes could be both material and immediate, versus the potential for them being material, but with a long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on when we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the public consultation begins in May. Thank you.Okay. Thanks very much.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the first one is on capitalized software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the PPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in your group accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of further impairments given that you want to retain only about 10% of these systems? And the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk- weighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metrics that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what would be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance, please ? Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Analyst_Bank\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Barclays\",\n          \"JP\",\n          \"KBW\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in the Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly more about2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1, Q2, or sorry, Q1 or year end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we have done is taken two-thirds down and have one-third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with how we think about a), the time it's going to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what we think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left, about a 1 billion that will have a shorter economic useful life, that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.Stefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable to us until 2027, it would be around 12.5%. 12-point-plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our CET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a clear, call it small, front running of what we expect to come. As a consequence of that, and our, and the finalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be calibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long-term expectation of the current interpretation of all regulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
