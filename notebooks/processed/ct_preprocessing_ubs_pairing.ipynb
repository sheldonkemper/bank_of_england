On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time trying to update estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate, are you able to give any color in terms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you\\u2019d like it to trend? And then secondly, just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of curious things like, you know, 10 billion gross, but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that do you expect to do where you found the incremental 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also, how you're spending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. So, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. You hear me well? Okay, perfect. So, my first question goes to GWM Americas. I think the target is low teens until 2026 and then up to mid-teens PBT margin. So, what strategic options are you taking to structurally lift profitability in this division? I think I heard this \\u2013 rebuilding the banking platform in-house, but if you can give us more color on that. So that's my first longer-term question. Whereas on the short term, in terms of transaction margins, those are being subdued for a while and especially in Asia. What evidence are you seeing or are you seeing any evidence of that coming back?

On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time trying to update estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate, are you able to give any color in terms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you\\u2019d like it to trend? And then secondly, just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of curious things like, you know, 10 billion gross, but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that do you expect to do where you found the incremental 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also, how you're spending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. So, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. You hear me well? Okay, perfect. So, my first question goes to GWM Americas. I think the target is low teens until 2026 and then up to mid-teens PBT margin. So, what strategic options are you taking to structurally lift profitability in this division? I think I heard this \\u2013 rebuilding the banking platform in-house, but if you can give us more color on that. So that's my first longer-term question. Whereas on the short term, in terms of transaction margins, those are being subdued for a while and especially in Asia. What evidence are you seeing or are you seeing any evidence of that coming back?

And from there onwards, we will look into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of\\u2026, going forward. And most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part of our offering. The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may have different views on certain client segments or people. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yes, Chris. On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But generally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive dividend policy is extremely unlikely to change over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to deliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, right? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus stock depending on where the stock trades. Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, share buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is sacrosanct and our progressive policy is also very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this in two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive story for more yield focused equity investors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Barclays\",\n          \"JP\",\n          \"KBW\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Morgan Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again for the disclosure. I hope some of the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard before from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are roughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share \\u2013 share with us the advisory part of that so we can kind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be paying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates? And in that context, if you could briefly talk about lending, which was down ex-US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your offering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending? And then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further legal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what capital relief you expect from that or maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the changes that will happen in when you describe it here on the page.Morgan And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at similar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last number we saw was $35.7 billion?Morgan Thanks.\",\n          \"Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me, just coming back on the cost issue, and the costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive, you're down 26% quarter-on- quarter. And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction. Just, I mean, the question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in terms of frontloading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL? And then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in any of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be mindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.Thank you.\",\n          \"Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me. So, on profitability, clearly better than expected in the quarter. Previously, you'd guided for positive underlying PBT in H2 and breakeven in the third quarter. So, given the third quarter is already quite positive, does that change how we should think about Q4? I guess the old guidance implied a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of PBT. So just wondering whether that's still the right way to think about that. And then, second, and I appreciate it's a bit of a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on CS net new money. You've given the regional disclosure on a combined basis, but I just wanted to check whether the combined regional picture, sort of Asia strong, EMEA strong, Switzerland more balanced. Is that consistent across both the CS and UBS Wealth franchises?Thanks, Todd. Helpful.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah, thanks, Anke. So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.No, no, the estimate is on the same basis we gave it in 4Q terms of the impact because it's mainly FRTB driven. So for now assume the guidance remains and as I said, if we have an update before we go live with it - of course we'll come back and provide it.\",\n          \"So, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory framework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms, but also vis-\\u00e0-vis the European peers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital base. Hey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar rate cuts. If there were fewer than those \\u2013 and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside, but of course, in our NII, but of course that depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know, behaves. So statically, yes, that would be corrected to be upside. If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or two on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client behavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that \\u2013 likely to be some degree of upside, all other things equal.Thank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and Todd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This document contains statements that constitute \\u201cforward-looking statements,\\u201d including but not limited to management\\u2019s outlook for UBS\\u2019s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS\\u2019s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS\\u2019s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS\\u2019s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia\\u2013Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia\\u2013Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS\\u2019s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS\\u2019s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS\\u2019s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS\\u2019s business activities; (vii) UBS\\u2019s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS\\u2019s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS\\u2019s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS\\u2019s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS\\u2019s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS\\u2019s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS\\u2019s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS\\u2019s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS\\u2019s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS\\u2019s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS\\u2019s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g. the Russia\\u2013Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS \\u2013 delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form 20- F for the year ended 31 December 2023. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\",\n          \" Okay. Thanks, Kian. Well, look, if I \\u2013 if you go back into our remarks, my remarks, in the past, I always clearly stated that starting a buyback program in 2024 would be at the start of a journey that would not be a stop-and-go kind of strategy. So I always, and we always, flagged the fact that in 2025 we would have a share buyback. Now we are reiterating that guidance by saying that we do expect in the early part of 2025, as we present Q4 results, to tell, like we did this year, the amount of ambitions or the size of the ambitions we have for 2025. So in that sense, I think that's \\u2013 I just \\u2013 we are just reiterating our commitments, also in respect of our ambitions for 2026 is that, of course, they are subject to requirements \\u2013 potential new requirements in Switzerland, and then we will assess. But our ambition is to have similar returns we had before the acquisition by 2026. Now for 2025, early 2025, your question, are we going to have more clarity? I don't know. We are not really in control of the timing. I think, I suspect, that we won't be able give a lot of guidance on that \\u2013 in that sense, because, as you know, we are still going through technical discussions. The consultation process probably is gonna start late this year or even in the early part of next year and is gonna to take a few\\u2013 few months, so it's very unlikely that in February we will be able to give much more clarity on this topic. And so this is very unlikely then to affect 2025 capital returns ambitions. And, you know, that also implies that there is no change in terms of the parent bank. As you saw, our parent bank, our overall capital position it's very strong. And also, when you look at our parent bank capital at 13.3% is very solid, is already on a fully applied basis and with a methodology on how we look at valuation of assets and subsidiaries, that is quite conservative definitely compared to what we saw in the past.Hi, Kian. Regarding your second question, in terms of lower rates and impact on our US wealth business. So first on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will \\u2013 and I made this comment earlier in my remarks \\u2013 you know, should spur additional lending opportunities across the division, including in the US. On the deposit side, in particular on sweeps, so first I'd say a couple of things, that we are seeing sweep deposits continue to taper. But in the quarter, we did have smaller outflows, so still about a billion of outflows. You know, I'd say that some of the market dynamics that I see in this regard, you know, one is that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are doing. Secondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra-high net worth. And for sure, that asset band tends to have a much lower percentage of AuM in sweeps. So that's going to be a market dynamic for us that will always weigh on, you know, that, that sensitivity, just given that with a more high net worth client base where there's more sensitivity in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally then there'll be lower balances and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see \\u2013 we will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.
