So, first, on slide 28. If I zoom in on 2026, you've guided to an exit run rates of 15% return on core Tier 1. But for the year as a whole, you flagged double digit, which I guess is sort of 10% to 12%. So, just wondering if there's something specific happening later towards the end of 2026 that's causing a sort of big jump up in profitability or perhaps whether I'm just being a bit too pessimistic on assuming that double digit means 10% to 12%? And then second, on distribution. We have the details in terms of what you want to do on the dividend this year, also the comments you've made on buybacks for 2024 and for 2025, but I was just thinking about how you think about the overall payout ratio longer term, 2026 onwards, and the split in that between dividends and buybacks.\",\n          \"Thank you. Let me take the first questions. I guess, as I mentioned before, now, we are under wealth management broader perimeter. I think that, of course, we may still have client advisors that resigned over the last three or four months or that, as they move into a new organization, they may be able to bring some assets with them. What we see right now is clear that the ability of the people that left a while ago to really move assets is fairly limited. And this is nothing new compared to what UBS went through 10 years ago or more than 10 years ago in recognizing that there is a lot of institutional loyalty of the client base. And now that we have stabilized the franchises, of course, we are even stronger in retaining assets. And as I mentioned before, our desires to re-bring back assets. So, look, the movement, the gross movements are going to be very difficult to predict, but the net outcome we feel pretty comfortable will be positive.\",\n          \"Yeah. Okay. Apologies. Technology is not my specialty. $100 billion net new assets in 2024 and 2025 but that feels like about dividends and interest given the shape of the balance sheet you provide in the slides. So, could you just talk \\u2013 just expand a little bit on what else the underlying outflows assumptions you're making perhaps on some of the relationships you took over with Credit Suisse whether that's case? And secondly, cash, now 18% of the balance sheet. Very, very high liquidity coverage ratio. Is that something that's just the new run rate or can you bring that down as you complete the complex legal entity restructuring?

And from there onwards, we will look into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of\\u2026, going forward. And most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part of our offering. The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may have different views on certain client segments or people. Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank Understood. Thank you.\",\n          \"So in respect of what you mentioned and changes in the law or regulations around liquidity. I think I can only say that it's pretty difficult to track all the rumors, speculations and ideas that are coming up, almost daily. On the Swiss media, I think that I can only tell you that, that at this stage what stands is that even the Finance Minister took an official stance on the matter. I mean, those are speculations. I don't believe this is going to be part of the package. I think that - I'm convinced that Switzerland will keep its standards in terms of allowing \\u2013 or responding to the crisis in March, not only the one in Switzerland, but broadly speaking, with following the recommendation that it will be set by the FSB and other bodies. And in that sense, I don't see us being particularly disadvantaged compared to any other jurisdictions in terms of a Liquidity Ordinance. So, I guess that we will follow up and I think it's going to still take months and months before the full analysis of what happened will translate into concrete actions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan']\",\n          \"['Anke Reingen, RBC']\",\n          \"['Amit Goel, Mediobanca']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Barclays\",\n          \"JP\",\n          \"KBW\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 88,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes. Morning. I have two questions, please. Two on Wealth Management. The first one would be on your pre-tax profit margin targets in the US. You're targeting mid-teens by 2026 and still significantly below what your US peers are doing. So, I wanted to know what kind of levers you can pull through to have this convergence towards the profitability levels that we are seeing of the US peers. And the second one will be on the net inflow that you are targeting. Is there any geographies where you see the most potential or where you are the most excited about where you \\u2013 where the CS merger is bringing new capabilities and new outlook? Thank you.Thank you.\",\n          \"Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?Very clear. Thanks.\",\n          \"Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to go back actually to some of the elements you have discussed on this call already, especially the NCL. Maybe trying to help us understand how much of the ROCET1 improvement towards 2026 is going to be driven by this unit, considering our move to natural runoff here, you know, trying to help us assess already at this stage what \\u2013 how loss-making it is today and how loss- making it would end up being in 2026, only considering the natural runoff. And then the other question I wanted to raise is on the cost save. Just to make sure I understand correctly. So you basically have already a target of 3 billion cost saves on an annualized run rate at the end of this year. But this is compared to the end of 2022, I think. So, how much of the annualized 3 billion do you kind of already have, you know, in the 2Q accounts, please? Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 88,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Yeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the \\u2013 look, on the pre-tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in his prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid- teens through the work that we've described, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting to what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, you know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's certainly the plan. So, you know, it's a little bit of walk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that we think that need to happen in the US business that we\\u2019re going to do over the next three years will set us up for success and being able to sort of then, at that stage, drive greater returns and narrow the gap further beyond 2026. In terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top, and I've talked about this before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that the CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where, meaningfully, change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client segments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former in terms of the client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited, again more of an affluent practice that we had many years ago, and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by the way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter. So, two examples where, and for different reasons of what excites us in terms of the acquisition.\",\n          \"Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and the value accretion and creation of this transaction. In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation.\",\n          \"Thanks, Flora. So, in terms of, I'll take, maybe address the second point first. In terms of the cost saves in the \\u2013 in terms of what we're projecting by the end of the year at 3 billion. In terms of what we see already in the second quarter, we haven't disclosed that specific number. But I think from just the head count reductions that I mentioned in my remarks, you could probably consider that there's somewhere more than, around half has already started to hit through, and what we're already seeing in our underlying results. In terms of our CET1 and how to think about NCL as we go through the process. For sure, NCL is, you know, is going to be something that weighs down on our CET1 naturally Just given the fact that, you know, we have significant, at least over the 2024 to 2026 period. If you just look at the natural profile rundown, which is effectively basis for how we started thinking about the RoCET,1 not the only way we started to model it, but, for sure, one of the ways that we were thinking about it. There's a drag by definition in the sense that, by the end of 2026, you could see in the slide the natural profile has roughly half going away. Now, we can model different scenarios as can you, but we're not going to discuss how we're thinking about it and obviously, some of that is still very much unknown. In terms of the cost takeout, we would expect to be taking out the lion's share of the costs in non-core and legacy by the time the integration is materially complete, by definition. We will do that. There\\u2019ll be, we expect some residual carry that we'll have to take on or continue to run down beyond 2026.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying reason for this drop. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past based on cost of capital. So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this flexibility to control our destiny. I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But this is something I\\u2019 like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top priorities, to clarify a path of \\u2013 for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and also reduce risks.\",\n          \"Hi, Giulia. Yeah, so on the balance sheet optimization, yeah, thanks. Thanks for recalling that point in my remarks, was, that is something we're, you know, quite proud of, that work which is driving up the, you know, the efficiency on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big piece of work that's been driven by the business \\u2013 really across the entire business. And so the impact is appreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it, so \\u2013 and I've talked about this a bit before, but effectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that had been largely inherited \\u2013 albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, you know, to the extent that they're sub-hurdle \\u2013 we've been taking the steps to drive additional revenues, you know, through repricing efforts, but importantly, to expand the product shelf and offering available to those clients who might be monoline clients. And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the uptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just been clients who were, you know, had a loan with us, with Credit Suisse, and now have a much broader array. And so, you know, it's a win-win as we bring a lot of value. I mentioned the impact on net new assets because naturally, as you attempt to optimize the balance sheet, while we've been successful, there will be times when you try to reprice that, you know, there will be clients, and in particular securities, leaving the platform. And so that's where the NNA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our otherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7 May 2024\",\n          \"30 October 2024\",\n          \"25 April 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1Q24\",\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"1Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"3q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\",\n          \"1q23-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ex_dummy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Sergio P.
