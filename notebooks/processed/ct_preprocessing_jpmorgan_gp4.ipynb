So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\",\n          \"Right, Mike. So I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s at a leadership off-site. That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s why he was here remote. So, I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.\",\n          \"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Erika\",\n          \"Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\",\n          \"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event \\n to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Asked By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Steven Chubak\",\n          \"Ken Usdin\",\n          \"Gerard Cassidy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person asked the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\",\n          \"Analyst, Jefferies LLC\",\n          \"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.\",\n          \"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c that'll be what it is.\",\n          \"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. And I would just add to that \\n just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase\",\n          \"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20,\n        \"min\": 6,\n        \"max\": 107,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          29,\n          20,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\",\n          \"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event \\n to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Asked By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Steven Chubak\",\n          \"Ken Usdin\",\n          \"Gerard Cassidy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person asked the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\",\n          \"Analyst, Jefferies LLC\",\n          \"Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.\",\n          \"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c that'll be what it is.\",\n          \"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. And I would just add to that \\n just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase\",\n          \"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20,\n        \"min\": 6,\n        \"max\": 107,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          29,\n          20,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\",\n          \"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event \\n to have excess liquidity?

Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.\",\n          \"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c that'll be what it is.\",\n          \"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. And I would just add to that \\n just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive Role Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase\",\n          \"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, \\nJamie Dimon Mr Dimon, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nGood morning, everybody Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the \\ndiscussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the \\nresulting bloodshed and more Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all \\nwho are suffering  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThanks, Jamie And of course, I very much echo the sentiment Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results The prese ntation is \\navailable on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back  \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $132 billion, EPS of $433 on revenue of $407 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22% \\nThese results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense On page 2, \\nwe have some more detail  \\n \\nSimilar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $22 billion of \\nrevenue, $858 million of expense and $11 bi llion of net income Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of \\n$385 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nNII ex Markets was up $48 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit \\nbalances NIR ex Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar And Markets \\nrevenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $209 billion were up $17 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing \\nas well as wage inflation and higher legal expense And credit costs were $14 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d \\nincluded a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 143%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior \\nquarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this \\nquarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will \\ncontinue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge  \\n \\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4 Given \\nthe significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important \\nto spend time discussing it And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular \\ndetail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that \\nbanks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress  \\n \\nGiven that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does \\nnot make sense to us Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which \\nresults in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion  \\n \\nOne immediate thing to point out is that at 45% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $225 billion of additional ca pital with no \\nchange in our  systemic risk footprint We've been on the record for a long time The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated \\noriginally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset \\nhas made matters worse And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA  \\n \\n3\\n \\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer \\nconstant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges Another lense on the proposed increases is the \\nintroduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer Although \\nthere's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in \\nthe SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by \\naround $30 billion without any change to our portfolio  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years Zooming ou t from the details \\nof this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017 Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have \\nbeen adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 45% So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their \\ncurrent form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point This illustrates again how over \\ncalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the \\nSCB And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e And aside from \\nthose dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework  \\n \\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here While it may technically be true  that the proposal is \\nBasel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements Implementing the Basel III Endgame \\nconsistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, \\nwould have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical \\ndetail For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the \\nflaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time Th e current proposal \\nexacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant \\nimpacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers  \\n \\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic \\nchanges of the current operation of the US capital markets We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying \\ncapital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, \\nwhich is vital to the US economy So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude  \\n \\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with \\nnominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower \\nincome groups normalizing faster  \\n \\nTurnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up \\n19% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates  End -of-period \\ndeposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our \\nleadership position in key markets Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\nas we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers  \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market Originations of $103 billion were up slightly quarter -on-\\nquarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued \\nnormalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were up $102 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained \\nmarket share  \\n \\nExpenses of $85 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $14 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, \\npredomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, \\nprimarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 7 CIB reported net income of $31 billion , on revenue of $117 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was \\ndown 6% year -on-year IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 86% In Advisory, \\nfees were down 10% Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the \\nfourth quarter Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  \\n \\n4\\n \\ncontinue to be a headwind Payments revenue was $21 billion, up 3% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by \\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances  \\n \\nMoving to Markets \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c total revenue was $66 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year Fixed Income was up \\n1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit This was \\npredominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year Equity Markets was down 1 0%, \\nreflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility Securities \\nServices revenue of $12 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances Expenses of $74 \\nbillion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation  \\n \\nCredit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net \\ncharge -offs of $45 million  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 8 Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $17 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 20% \\nyear-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates And Gross Investment Banking and Markets \\nrevenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume  \\n \\nExpenses of $14 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 7% year -\\non-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives  \\n \\nLoans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization And \\nCRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $11 billion, with pr e-tax margin \\nof 31% Revenue of $46 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \\nlevels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits Expenses of $31 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JP Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares \\nacquisitions  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of \\n$40 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $46 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows of higher market levels Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, \\npartially offset by client inflows  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 10 Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $15 billion, up $18 billion com pared to last \\nyear NII was $2 billio n, up $12 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the \\nnet investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $885 billion and $89 billion, \\nrespectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, \\nwhile we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable  \\n \\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal \\nexpense  Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment  \\n \\nAnd on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 25%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent \\nbalance growth  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various \\nsources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd \\nthe impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past But as always, we con tinue to \\nprepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n5\",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements Please stand by \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum \\nMr Barnum, please go ahead \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $481 on revenue of $437 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21% On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $12 billion or 21% \\n \\nExpenses of $228 billion were down $17 billion or 7% year-on-year Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $12 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory \\n \\nExpenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 \\nbillion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very \\nconsistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we \\nhaven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A \\n \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I \\njust wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGreat All right So let's go to questions \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, \\nJamie Dimon Mr Dimon, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nGood morning, everybody Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the \\ndiscussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the \\nresulting bloodshed and more Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all \\nwho are suffering  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThanks, Jamie And of course, I very much echo the sentiment Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results The prese ntation is \\navailable on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back  \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $132 billion, EPS of $433 on revenue of $407 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22% \\nThese results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense On page 2, \\nwe have some more detail  \\n \\nSimilar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $22 billion of \\nrevenue, $858 million of expense and $11 bi llion of net income Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of \\n$385 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nNII ex Markets was up $48 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit \\nbalances NIR ex Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar And Markets \\nrevenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $209 billion were up $17 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing \\nas well as wage inflation and higher legal expense And credit costs were $14 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d \\nincluded a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 143%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior \\nquarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this \\nquarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will \\ncontinue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge  \\n \\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4 Given \\nthe significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important \\nto spend time discussing it And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular \\ndetail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that \\nbanks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress  \\n \\nGiven that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does \\nnot make sense to us Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which \\nresults in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion  \\n \\nOne immediate thing to point out is that at 45% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $225 billion of additional ca pital with no \\nchange in our  systemic risk footprint We've been on the record for a long time The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated \\noriginally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset \\nhas made matters worse And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA  \\n \\n3\\n \\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer \\nconstant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges Another lense on the proposed increases is the \\nintroduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer Although \\nthere's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in \\nthe SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by \\naround $30 billion without any change to our portfolio  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years Zooming ou t from the details \\nof this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017 Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have \\nbeen adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 45% So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their \\ncurrent form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point This illustrates again how over \\ncalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the \\nSCB And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e And aside from \\nthose dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework  \\n \\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here While it may technically be true  that the proposal is \\nBasel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements Implementing the Basel III Endgame \\nconsistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, \\nwould have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical \\ndetail For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the \\nflaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time Th e current proposal \\nexacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant \\nimpacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers  \\n \\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic \\nchanges of the current operation of the US capital markets We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying \\ncapital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, \\nwhich is vital to the US economy So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude  \\n \\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with \\nnominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower \\nincome groups normalizing faster  \\n \\nTurnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up \\n19% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates  End -of-period \\ndeposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our \\nleadership position in key markets Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\nas we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers  \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market Originations of $103 billion were up slightly quarter -on-\\nquarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued \\nnormalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were up $102 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained \\nmarket share  \\n \\nExpenses of $85 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $14 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, \\npredomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, \\nprimarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 7 CIB reported net income of $31 billion , on revenue of $117 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was \\ndown 6% year -on-year IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 86% In Advisory, \\nfees were down 10% Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the \\nfourth quarter Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  \\n \\n4\\n \\ncontinue to be a headwind Payments revenue was $21 billion, up 3% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by \\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances  \\n \\nMoving to Markets \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c total revenue was $66 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year Fixed Income was up \\n1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit This was \\npredominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year Equity Markets was down 1 0%, \\nreflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility Securities \\nServices revenue of $12 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances Expenses of $74 \\nbillion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation  \\n \\nCredit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net \\ncharge -offs of $45 million  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 8 Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $17 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 20% \\nyear-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates And Gross Investment Banking and Markets \\nrevenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume  \\n \\nExpenses of $14 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 7% year -\\non-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives  \\n \\nLoans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization And \\nCRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $11 billion, with pr e-tax margin \\nof 31% Revenue of $46 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \\nlevels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits Expenses of $31 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JP Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares \\nacquisitions  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of \\n$40 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $46 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows of higher market levels Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, \\npartially offset by client inflows  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 10 Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $15 billion, up $18 billion com pared to last \\nyear NII was $2 billio n, up $12 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the \\nnet investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $885 billion and $89 billion, \\nrespectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, \\nwhile we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable  \\n \\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal \\nexpense  Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment  \\n \\nAnd on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 25%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent \\nbalance growth  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various \\nsources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd \\nthe impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past But as always, we con tinue to \\nprepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n5\",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements Please stand by \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum \\nMr Barnum, please go ahead \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $481 on revenue of $437 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21% On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $12 billion or 21% \\n \\nExpenses of $228 billion were down $17 billion or 7% year-on-year Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $12 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory \\n \\nExpenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 \\nbillion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very \\nconsistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we \\nhaven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A \\n \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I \\njust wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just
