Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well? Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business? Appreciate the color. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year -over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks. Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?\\nThat's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?\\nGot it.

So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\\nSo, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\\nSo, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\\nSure. The truth is \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\\nI think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\\nAnd another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\\nBut any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\",\n          \"I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c if they \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c one thing to project it today based on what \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history. Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Got it. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\\nThank you.\\nThanks.\\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\\nYeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.\\nGot it. Okay.

I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.\",\n          \"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.\\nIt's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.\\nYeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.\\nIt's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.\\nI mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list.

Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Got it. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\\nThank you.\\nThanks.\\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\\nYeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.\\nGot it. Okay.

I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.\",\n          \"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.\\nIt's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.\\nYeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.\\nIt's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.\\nI mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list.

Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Got it. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\\nThank you.\\nThanks.\\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\",\n          \"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\\nYeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.\\nGot it. Okay.

I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.\",\n          \"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.\\nIt's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.\\nYeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.\\nIt's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.\\nI mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list.

SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, \\nJamie Dimon Mr Dimon, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nGood morning, everybody Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the \\ndiscussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the \\nresulting bloodshed and more Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all \\nwho are suffering  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThanks, Jamie And of course, I very much echo the sentiment Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results The prese ntation is \\navailable on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back  \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $132 billion, EPS of $433 on revenue of $407 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22% \\nThese results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense On page 2, \\nwe have some more detail  \\n \\nSimilar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $22 billion of \\nrevenue, $858 million of expense and $11 bi llion of net income Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of \\n$385 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nNII ex Markets was up $48 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit \\nbalances NIR ex Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar And Markets \\nrevenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $209 billion were up $17 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing \\nas well as wage inflation and higher legal expense And credit costs were $14 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d \\nincluded a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 143%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior \\nquarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this \\nquarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will \\ncontinue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge  \\n \\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4 Given \\nthe significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important \\nto spend time discussing it And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular \\ndetail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that \\nbanks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress  \\n \\nGiven that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does \\nnot make sense to us Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which \\nresults in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion  \\n \\nOne immediate thing to point out is that at 45% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $225 billion of additional ca pital with no \\nchange in our  systemic risk footprint We've been on the record for a long time The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated \\noriginally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset \\nhas made matters worse And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA  \\n \\n3\\n \\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer \\nconstant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges Another lense on the proposed increases is the \\nintroduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer Although \\nthere's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in \\nthe SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by \\naround $30 billion without any change to our portfolio  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years Zooming ou t from the details \\nof this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017 Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have \\nbeen adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 45% So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their \\ncurrent form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point This illustrates again how over \\ncalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the \\nSCB And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e And aside from \\nthose dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework  \\n \\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here While it may technically be true  that the proposal is \\nBasel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements Implementing the Basel III Endgame \\nconsistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, \\nwould have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical \\ndetail For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the \\nflaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time Th e current proposal \\nexacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant \\nimpacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers  \\n \\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic \\nchanges of the current operation of the US capital markets We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying \\ncapital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, \\nwhich is vital to the US economy So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude  \\n \\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with \\nnominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower \\nincome groups normalizing faster  \\n \\nTurnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up \\n19% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates  End -of-period \\ndeposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our \\nleadership position in key markets Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\nas we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers  \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market Originations of $103 billion were up slightly quarter -on-\\nquarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued \\nnormalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were up $102 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained \\nmarket share  \\n \\nExpenses of $85 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $14 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, \\npredomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, \\nprimarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 7 CIB reported net income of $31 billion , on revenue of $117 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was \\ndown 6% year -on-year IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 86% In Advisory, \\nfees were down 10% Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the \\nfourth quarter Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  \\n \\n4\\n \\ncontinue to be a headwind Payments revenue was $21 billion, up 3% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by \\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances  \\n \\nMoving to Markets \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c total revenue was $66 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year Fixed Income was up \\n1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit This was \\npredominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year Equity Markets was down 1 0%, \\nreflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility Securities \\nServices revenue of $12 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances Expenses of $74 \\nbillion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation  \\n \\nCredit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net \\ncharge -offs of $45 million  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 8 Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $17 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 20% \\nyear-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates And Gross Investment Banking and Markets \\nrevenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume  \\n \\nExpenses of $14 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 7% year -\\non-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives  \\n \\nLoans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization And \\nCRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $11 billion, with pr e-tax margin \\nof 31% Revenue of $46 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \\nlevels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits Expenses of $31 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JP Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares \\nacquisitions  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of \\n$40 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $46 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows of higher market levels Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, \\npartially offset by client inflows  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 10 Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $15 billion, up $18 billion com pared to last \\nyear NII was $2 billio n, up $12 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the \\nnet investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $885 billion and $89 billion, \\nrespectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, \\nwhile we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable  \\n \\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal \\nexpense  Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment  \\n \\nAnd on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 25%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent \\nbalance growth  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various \\nsources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd \\nthe impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past But as always, we con tinue to \\nprepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n5\",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements Please stand by \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum \\nMr Barnum, please go ahead \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $481 on revenue of $437 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21% On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $12 billion or 21% \\n \\nExpenses of $228 billion were down $17 billion or 7% year-on-year Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $12 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory \\n \\nExpenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 \\nbillion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very \\nconsistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we \\nhaven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A \\n \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I \\njust wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGreat All right So let's go to questions \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, \\nJamie Dimon Mr Dimon, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nGood morning, everybody Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the \\ndiscussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the \\nresulting bloodshed and more Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all \\nwho are suffering  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThanks, Jamie And of course, I very much echo the sentiment Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results The prese ntation is \\navailable on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back  \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $132 billion, EPS of $433 on revenue of $407 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22% \\nThese results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense On page 2, \\nwe have some more detail  \\n \\nSimilar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $22 billion of \\nrevenue, $858 million of expense and $11 bi llion of net income Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of \\n$385 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nNII ex Markets was up $48 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit \\nbalances NIR ex Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar And Markets \\nrevenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $209 billion were up $17 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing \\nas well as wage inflation and higher legal expense And credit costs were $14 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d \\nincluded a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 143%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior \\nquarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this \\nquarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will \\ncontinue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge  \\n \\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4 Given \\nthe significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important \\nto spend time discussing it And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular \\ndetail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that \\nbanks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress  \\n \\nGiven that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does \\nnot make sense to us Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which \\nresults in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion  \\n \\nOne immediate thing to point out is that at 45% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $225 billion of additional ca pital with no \\nchange in our  systemic risk footprint We've been on the record for a long time The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated \\noriginally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset \\nhas made matters worse And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA  \\n \\n3\\n \\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer \\nconstant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges Another lense on the proposed increases is the \\nintroduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer Although \\nthere's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in \\nthe SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by \\naround $30 billion without any change to our portfolio  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years Zooming ou t from the details \\nof this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017 Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have \\nbeen adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 45% So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their \\ncurrent form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point This illustrates again how over \\ncalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the \\nSCB And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e And aside from \\nthose dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework  \\n \\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here While it may technically be true  that the proposal is \\nBasel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements Implementing the Basel III Endgame \\nconsistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, \\nwould have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical \\ndetail For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the \\nflaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time Th e current proposal \\nexacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant \\nimpacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers  \\n \\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic \\nchanges of the current operation of the US capital markets We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying \\ncapital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, \\nwhich is vital to the US economy So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude  \\n \\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with \\nnominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower \\nincome groups normalizing faster  \\n \\nTurnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic CCB reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up \\n19% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates  End -of-period \\ndeposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our \\nleadership position in key markets Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\nas we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers  \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market Originations of $103 billion were up slightly quarter -on-\\nquarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower auto lease income Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued \\nnormalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were up $102 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained \\nmarket share  \\n \\nExpenses of $85 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $14 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, \\npredomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, \\nprimarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 7 CIB reported net income of $31 billion , on revenue of $117 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was \\ndown 6% year -on-year IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 86% In Advisory, \\nfees were down 10% Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the \\nfourth quarter Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  \\n \\n4\\n \\ncontinue to be a headwind Payments revenue was $21 billion, up 3% year -on-year Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by \\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances  \\n \\nMoving to Markets \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c total revenue was $66 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year Fixed Income was up \\n1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit This was \\npredominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year Equity Markets was down 1 0%, \\nreflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility Securities \\nServices revenue of $12 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances Expenses of $74 \\nbillion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation  \\n \\nCredit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net \\ncharge -offs of $45 million  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 8 Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $17 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 20% \\nyear-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates And Gross Investment Banking and Markets \\nrevenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume  \\n \\nExpenses of $14 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 7% year -\\non-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives  \\n \\nLoans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization And \\nCRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $11 billion, with pr e-tax margin \\nof 31% Revenue of $46 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \\nlevels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits Expenses of $31 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JP Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares \\nacquisitions  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of \\n$40 billion AUM of $32 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $46 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows of higher market levels Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, \\npartially offset by client inflows  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 10 Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $15 billion, up $18 billion com pared to last \\nyear NII was $2 billio n, up $12 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the \\nnet investment securities losses I mentioned upfront Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11 We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex Markets to be approximately $885 billion and $89 billion, \\nrespectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, \\nwhile we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable  \\n \\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal \\nexpense  Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment  \\n \\nAnd on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 25%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent \\nbalance growth  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various \\nsources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd \\nthe impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past But as always, we con tinue to \\nprepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n5\",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Good

2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and

expenses were up $12 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory \\n \\nExpenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 \\nbillion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very \\nconsistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we \\nhaven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A \\n \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I \\njust wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGreat All right So let's go to questions \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
