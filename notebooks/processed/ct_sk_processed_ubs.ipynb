You know, naturally, it's a function of timing and ensuring that we continue to run down the positions in that entity and get the support from the regulator to repatriate the remaining capital in that entity as we transfer our positions, as I mentioned. And, you know, there could be leakage between now and then if we have losses in the entity. So, you know, conservatively, I mentioned around 5 billion that would come from CSI from here.

Sergio, I get the message: don't get overexcited in terms of how capital would be repatriated and solve potentially a capital issue. But if I look at slide 32 and I got very excited when I saw the 13 billion, but clearly, it hasn't ended up in the parent bank. It has been further upstreamed. It looks like it. And I'm just trying to understand the rationale of the upstream and also trying to understand if there's room to downstream again, if necessary. And in that context and also trying to understand how much more capital is there in CS International? It should be something like 5 billion to 6 billion from what I calculate. And if there's any other subsidiaries that you would highlight, where there's room for potential further upstreaming into the parent going forward? So really just trying to square the process. I'm a little bit confused in that sense and if you could help me, I would really appreciate it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"4 February 2025\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"4Q24\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_file\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"4q24-earnings-call-remarks.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
