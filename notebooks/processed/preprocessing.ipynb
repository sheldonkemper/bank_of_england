And then just separately to squeeze in \\u2013 you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching\\u2026\",\n          \"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher.

And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website. But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Garc\\u00eda Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion. That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions. We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate. Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends. In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year. While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight. First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online. We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth. Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jos\\u00e9 or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please Jos\\u00e9. Jos\\u00e9, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance. Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%. So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year. Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment. This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue. We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses. We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer. Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re\\u4f0eed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re\\u4f0eed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year. This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it. And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25. So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail. Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see. I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jos\\u00e9 to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments. With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect. Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good. We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect. I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail. Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds. Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well. For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important to understand what the model changes about. The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I. If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you. Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask Jos\\u00e9 to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina. In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points. And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead. Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks. First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits. Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please. There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead. Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken. Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates. Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you. Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye you\",\n          \" Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website. But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Garc\\u00eda Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion. That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions. We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate. Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends. In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year. While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight. First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online. We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth. Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jos\\u00e9 or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please Jos\\u00e9. Jos\\u00e9, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance. Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%. So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year. Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment. This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue. We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses. We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer. Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re\\u4f0eed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re\\u4f0eed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year. This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it. And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25. So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail. Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see. I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jos\\u00e9 to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments. With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect. Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good. We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect. I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail. Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds. Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well. For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important to understand what the model changes about. The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I. If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you. Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask Jos\\u00e9 to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina. In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points. And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead. Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks. First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits. Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please. There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead. Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken. Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates. Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you. Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye turtle\",\n          \" Good morning everybody and welcome to Van Kursenthenders Conference call to discuss our financial results for the first nine months of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that during the presentation when we refer to global and network businesses we are following the definition which was given during our investor day last February as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in January 24. I am joined here today by your CEO Mr. Rector Grisi and our CFO Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Arteacantera. Following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question please press star and five on your phone. With this I will hand over to Mr. Grisi, Hector the floor is yours. Thank you, Vigonia. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will focus on today. First I will talk about our nine months results in the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our investor day. Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with a few closer remarks. As you can see we had another strong quarter demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business model even in times of market volatility as well as a solid execution of our strategy. With the lever record profit of 2.9 billion that's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in 22 that's 26% in constant euros. Profit for the first nine months of 23 was 8.1 billion up 13% in constant euros driven by strong customer revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year supported by all global businesses and all our unions. Commercial activity remains solid we have the nine million new customers in the last 12 months bringing the total to 166 million. We continue to advance towards a simpler more integrated model through our one transformation which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result our efficiency ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44. Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15% while earnings per share improved by 17% year-on-year supported by profit growth and share buybacks. We further strengthen our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter even after the adopting the share buyback underway and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder valuation and attractive remuneration. Tina plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months and we have increased the cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year. Moving to the income statement as always we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros. Profit increases strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters supported by first of all strong top-light performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as cost increase well below revenue reflecting our transformation efforts. Double digit growth in net operating income to more than 24 billion. Normalization of loan-loss provisions in line with our expectations and as I mentioned in the previous slide this trend resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q223. We will now go into more detail on this once later. These results maintain some track to achieve our 23 targets, targets that we rate the rate. First of all good business dynamics led to double digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range even with investments in one transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as suspected and capital ahead of target with C-T1 improving quarter-on-quarter. A rotate is close to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at the end. Looking closer at capital and value creation our C-T1 ratio has grown year to date from 12% to 12.3% backed by a strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continue to grow our shareholders value creation which was up 12% in the first nine months of the year and we're increasing our shareholders remuneration with payout up to 50%. In September the board of directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results which is being executed as follows. A cash dividend of 8.1 cents per share to be paid in November 39% higher than the equivalent in 22. A share buyback program of up to 1.3 billion that is currently on the way. Since 21 and after completing the current program sometimes that will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares, buybacks through share buybacks. We are progressing in our new phase of value creation and transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. One transformation which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for retail and commercial business across all of our geographies will lead to improved customer service efficiency and profitability. In simplification we have reduced the number of products by 8% in 23. That's almost 800 less products. In digitalization we're making good progress with our digital sales service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by 16%. We have set up a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just six minutes to complete. Since it's launched in July we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the US we have already captured around 114 million in savings from transformation and simplification. As you can see on this slide the initial efficiencies from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 117 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 39 basis points in efficiency gains. For example, multilatinas and multi-Europeans initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model are growing at very high rates with revenue up by 50% in 23 year-on-year. In private banking we continue boosting collaboration with CIVN corporates which has generated over 160 million revenue this year or 30% percent. In Brazil we have acquired 117 new relationships that brought 6 billion reais in net near money. In payments get net already operates in five countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the UK in 24. In Auto we continue to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. In January 23 we have expanded three of our OEM partnerships to new countries. Finally our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a 29 basis points improvement in efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a 125 million saves in this year. 55 from the recent deployment of gravity, 60 from the new global agreements with vendors and 9 million from the implementation of new IT and OBS shared services. Let's look at how one transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue proactive customer. Process automation is enabling us to spend less time in operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Since our investor day we have reduced the number of operational FTs per million customers by 5%. We are already deploying global platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale and spread best practices. We have implemented across the group proprietary backhand gravity already deployed in three countries and CIB. This is delivering 55 million inefficiencies in 23 and we have executed 75 billion transactions this year alone, that's 10% of the group's total. We're expanding our cards platform across a group, delivering real-time digital processing capability store banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around 100 million per year when it's fully deployed. Finally, we are being able to transfer the best in-class products and processes from the country of Oregon to the rest of the group, which lets to a strong value creation. The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear. In CIB we continue to grow strongly. Our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop-shop service to all our clients, capturing crozor their flows and making CIB products and services available to our wealth, retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa. As a result, revenue from these two concepts or negative revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to 3 billion. Wealth management and insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well-abop target, boosted by benefits of the Santander network effect. In private banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have 52 billion of assets on their management book tabo. That's 12% higher than a year ago. Our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market. Our payments have has become one of the largest processors of account-to-account payments in Europe. Spain, the UK and CIB are already processing a significant payment volume through Pagonext, while we execute full migration of all the groups 8 to 8 payments in the next 18 months. In Alto, we continue to prioritize profitability of our market share growth in a context of rising interest rates. Global auto revenue was affected by lower-list income in the US and the new regulation in Germany. One transformation is now being extended across a group and the increasing contribution from a global and a group of businesses are helping us to reach our 25 profitability targets across regions and businesses. Some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates and they should continue to do so in 24. As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of improvement. This is a clear competitive advantage that will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation. The group's Rote rose 126 basis points year-on-year to run 15% as mentioned before. Jose will go now in more detail to the group's performance. Thank you Jose. Thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail. Starting with revenue, there was strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. This was primarily supported by a retail business as we actively managed interest rate tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America. We delivered double digit growth across most businesses, in particular our network businesses which made up 38% of total revenue. The only exception was auto which was affected by lower listening income in the US. Revenue at the corporate center also improved by more than 500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII which continued its upward trend, increasing 7% in the quarter driven mostly by Europe and Mexico. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. Nine months 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in DCV North America and South America. In terms of profitability we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion. In Europe we are strictly managing the positive costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, whether it's excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment but beat us remaining in line with our expectations. In South America the positive rates are more directly linked to market interest rates with results in negative sensitivity to raising rates. Therefore as interest rates are starting to decline we are seeing improved NII trends. In North America in the US beat us continue to increase, although in line with our expectations while net interest margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward in Europe we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in a constant in a context of stable interest rates or a slight increase which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of the positive growth at least in the first half of next year. At the same time as I said we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in South America. Turning to fees in an environment of low-fink and growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity our netfink and grew 9% compared to the third quarter of 22 and 6% year on year with good performance across regions and businesses. Retail banking grew well supported by a larger customer base and our tailored and targeted value propositions. Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees with corporate investment banking and Paganxed leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate investment banking is increasing its share of leading roles and Paganxed continued to expand its businesses increasing total payment volumes 24% year on year and transactions 32%. Wealth management and insurance was slightly up as customers moved to lower value added funds than bringing lower fees. However we saw increase activity in both private banking and Santanderas' management with three consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year on year driven by good performance in all our main markets. In terms of cost savings from one transformation initiatives which will become more evident in the coming quarters are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization. Group cost declined 0.5% real-terms and driving down the transaction cost per active the transactional cost per active customer 2% in real-terms as sector mentioned earlier. This in turn is reflected in efficiency gains laid by Europe which improved six percentage points with cost flat in real-terms. In North America and DCB cost increases likely in real-terms reflecting investments to accelerate transformation. Additionally cost was also slightly affected by some perimeter effects such as the incorporation of APS in the US and MCE bank acquisition and US delantes agreement in DCB. As a result group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expected to stay for the rest of the year. Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in use car prices in the US. The MPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than 1.2%. Spain continues to perform well with a 12-man cost of risk down nine basis points year-on-year supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. In other units such as the UK Portugal and the digital consumer bank the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expected to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Mexico is also increasing although it remains at comfortable levels mainly due to a change in mix towards and secure loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability. Normalization continues in the US in line with expectations. As we mentioned last quarter cost of risk in Brazil seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-man cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row and the MPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high rated customers. To close with our balance structure we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment product and country. Our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low loan to values, average loan to values. Loans decrease 2% year-on-year as a consequence of higher interest rates reducing credit demand and driving early repayments, especially evident in Europe and especially evident within European mortgages. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and the C.B. On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well at 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as the positive inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments. Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which has stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes. Mutual funds rose 11% with growth across all countries except the US following a year of instability in 2022. Our fully-doted capital ratio improved to 12.3%, but by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in a quarter, which included 33 basis points charged in shareholder remuneration. 21 related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual. We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a frontbook return on res-weighted assets of 2.7% up from 2.5% in the first nine months of 2022 equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of res-weighted assets with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our investor day target of 85 in 2025. Increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years. We are confident our fully-loaded capital ratio will remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel 3 in 2025 on a fully-loaded basis. That's all from my side, Ektor, over to you. Thank you. Thank you Jose. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with customer and double digit revenue growth supported by all region regions and businesses. We are accelerating one transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth. We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CETI-1, while credit quality remains strong in line with our expectations. All of these contributes to double digit growth in shareholder value creation and increased remuneration. We remain on track to meet our 23 targets. The execution for strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability. We see further upside potential for NII growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rates hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South America. Efficiency, or ready at the lower range of our 23 target, is expected to keep improving or revenue cost as we increasingly realize one transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target and we expect it to remain at similar levels in 24. At our investor day, we set a rotted target of 15 to 17%. We expect to reach a rote above 15% by the year end and continue to improve significantly during 24. And we see our fully loaded CET-1 clearly above a 12% target even after the implementation of ASL-3 in January 25. As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double digit shareholder value creation through the cycle further supported by our last step towards the full implementation of one standard which will enable us to fully capture our in market and global value. And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions. Thank you, Hector. We're ready to start the Q&A session. Can we have the first question please? If you wish to ask the question, please press star 500 telephone. We already have the first question from Francisco Rical from Alan Trague. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I want to focus on long growth. In Spain has been particularly weak, it's down 10% year and year, the sector is minus 3. I see that most of the fall is related to CIV, which is down over 20%, but SME and Morgan Villes are also weak if you can comment the gap with the sector. We know demand is weak, but below the sector. More broader in other regions, I mean, longs in the UK are also down 5%, the sector is up 1, Brazil is up by just 3%. The sector is growing 9%, so you can elaborate on whether you are feiorityizing margins over volumes. If you are more prudent on risk taking up this point in the cycle, so long growth in general and in Spain in particular. Thank you. Thank you Francisco. Yes, basically, as you have said, long growth has not been good in the old year, I would say. Spain mainly, as you basically say, is also being affected by prepayments in some of the mortgages. If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen, I mean, normally, basically, we go down 3.5, this basically we have had prepayments up to 6.5 billion so far this year. You write SME and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and the man continues to be strong, this is a fact and we have seen the clients basically being cautious. Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America, is continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability. So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way. And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year and we continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear bill of what's going on. I believe that credit will come back. Little by little. I don't know if you would like just one. One final comment. Resuaded assets are down to billion in the quarter, but it's exclusively due to effects. So if we look, if we exclude effects impact on resuaded assets, resuaded assets are actually flat in the quarter, which is what, you know, matter most for profitability and capital. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. I'm Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the profitability outlook and the second one on us acquiring the US. So starting with the first one, you've right away to your guidance for the Fulia, which, if a mom is taken implies, an app profit around 10.9 billion euros for this year. Can you confirm that? And how do you see profitability in 2024? It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the US. My second question is respect to our equality in the US. There was a big uptick this quarter and you've been talking about normalization and cost of risk. And I will see lower use car prices and higher the link, but neither of them were material changes. So a question is what's driving this? Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing specifically on us, equality, and related to that. I see you've confirmed your 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do you expect this number to look like next year? Thank you. Yes, thank you, Antonio. Okay, on profitability, as I say during the presentation, I rate the rate, the 15% rotting, so that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for. Okay, so in that sense, we'll pretty comfortable on that. On 24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing, so we see an strong first half of the year in Europe, and then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamic changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better. Okay, so in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that. In terms of asset quality in the US, and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look of what happened last year in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that and we told you so. And what is important to tell you that is actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points as you correctly appoint. In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day the link-wancies or above when it's used to happen is we use to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better and we are repossessing between 60 and 65% of those. If the trade continues like that and a use car prices in the US continue like that, we expect better performance that we normally expect. It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio. But that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain a good levels. And also the US has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamics as well. So in that sense I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you. Jose, please would like to compliment on the profitability? Yeah, just one final comment on US As a Quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85 and given the changes in the mix that Ektor mentioned, we don't expect to reach those levels at all and we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly apt compared to 2023 in the US. In terms of profitability, we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So rates start going down. We will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil in particular, coupled with higher long growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly the profitability in South America sector mentioned is going to gain momentum throughout the year, which with a much better second half relative to the first half. And in Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprise on the asset side. There's one example. In Spain we have around 80 billion of mortgages. You know that they reprise around 12 every month. Well, in fact, we reprise 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of 24, we will still reprise a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to reprising. So asset reprising, particularly in Spain, and obviously some beta pressures and the cost of deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we actually, you know, we remain constructive on profitability and profitability improving actually in 24 relative to 23. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Sophie Peterson for JP Morgan, please go ahead. Yeah, hi. Here is the feedback from JP Morgan. Just to develop on the previous question. So could you just remind us what the current deposit beta in Spain is? And I got a part with Moved in the quarter and also how you see the deposit beta moving in the other geographies, mainly UK, US, and I guess also Portugal. So that would be my first question. And then the second question would be around the US tax rate. It was very low this quarter. How should we think about the US tax rate going forward and what kind of normalised run rate? And then if I may, just if you get comments on any capital headlines going forward, thank you. Thank you Sophie. And if you're on to use, plainly, I'll be the second question because we couldn't hear you well. First of all, on deposit bitters, I mean bitters today's in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had. And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally. And we expect pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase. I mean, it's normal because of the dynamics of what's going on. And the geographies we are present are showing a different behaviour. Our CO4 now give you a little bit further details on that. Yeah, Sophie, in Spain, total beta is slightly over 20%, 22%. But if we exclude corporate investment banking, corporate investment banking is already almost fully priced. X corporate investment banking is 13%. Remember that we have 153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes. So and the beta there is almost zero. We don't expect any significant change in the behaviour in the market in the coming quarter. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year. In the UK, beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that, it's around 50%. So here we would expect higher, gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in the UK today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland 30%, and in the US is 32%. XCV, X corporate investment banking is 31%. Very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that. So bottom line is we would expect cost of the process to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly in Spain, also in the UK, etc. So in terms of the tax rate in the US going forward, what I could tell you and we could basically contact you to give you more detail, I believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles and that basically helps us in the tax rate that we have outstanding today. But to give you details, we later could call you and give you exactly what's going on there. Your final question, capital head. The only one is the only significant capital head we have is the final implementation of Basel III. Still some detail rulings or regulations need to be written, but bottom line is the total fully loaded impact would be around 50 or 55 basis points. The facing impact, so the charge on January 1st, 25, is going to be between 15 to 20 basis points. So again, very much in line with previous expectations, maybe it's better than what we expected. Thank you, Sophie. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Ignacio Larghi from BNP Pariva, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I just have a thanks for taking my question time for the presentation. I have just two questions. The first one on Brazil, after the performance that we have seen this quarter, where that has been growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we suspect better, moment in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk appetite? So we see an acceleration of growth also due to mixed changes as we are seeing in Mexico. And what should be a spec for 2024 from Brazil? And also, if you could say a bit of color on what has been the driver of course growth in Spain in the quarter and whether we suspect some synergies coming from one to another in coming quarters in Spain or or it's more restricted to Mexico and the US. Thank you. Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been seeing is as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix. Okay? So you're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out. First of all, because our some of them, the positions that we took actually the credit loans that we gave, basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out. Because remember that the mix that we changed went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans and the mix has also changed and is getting better. We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs. So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean, we're open to a little bit more of giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well. But our credit appetite is cautious nevertheless. And we expect Brazil, basically, to perform really well in that sense. Okay? So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we manage in the portfolio. And second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe is going to be much better. In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we are being implementing one transformation. Okay? So with implementation of one transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit some processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the banking that sense. But as you're going to see, a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact, because we are, as you know, we are simplification, we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have. We are doing also automation of many different things. And we are pushing our branches, basically, to move more toward businesses than look at the incidence of problems. So all that transformation that we're making in the, in all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more. But it's going to be in control. And we expect that to continue drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that. Okay? So in terms of, in Brazil going back to just to that, just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of 24. Okay? As we continue to go on and we'll be lob the portfolio is going to be performing much better. Okay? I don't know Jose, if you would like to complement? As I said, I think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum. So we have already started to see a slight change. Rates have dropped just a hundred basis points to from 1375 to 1275. We expect another 100 basis point drop in the third quarter. Sorry, in the fourth quarter. But we would expect probably 200 to 250 drop next year. So this accumulates. So when we look at year-on-year, third quarter, fourth quarter, we would see rates probably 400 basis points down. So clearly the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano for Moro Young Stanley. Please go ahead. Next question and we'll recapture Alvaro later on. Thank you. Thank you. The next question from San Pedro from CD. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on restructuring charges. So understand your profitability target is underlying. Should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your new reporting structure? The second question is your outlook on operating expenses in the US. You've gone on a hiring of investment bankers recently. So what is the outlook for cost and how much revenue do you expect to generate as a result? And just quickly on your effective tax rating, Brazil for 2024, and what is your expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital? Thank you. Thank you, Marta. No, we don't expect any restructuring charges at all or because of the restructuring that we just did in the organization. The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. Okay, this is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what one transformation means, which means exactly simplifying first of all, okay, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly, okay. Second, basically, automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, okay, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a good, really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client. In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain, it's 50% of that. So basically, this is what one transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, MhR acquiring that has been deployed already, mostly Latin America, you see the cost coming down, and you see also that we're getting revenue on quota from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand where one transformation is, and why are we doing this? Second, in terms of, you said one question, what's on operating expenses in the US? Very important question. What we're doing in the US is just a complement of the rest of our CIV business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIV, I mean large for the standards of Latin America, and a very important player also in CIV in Europe. It's important to point out that 94% of our business that we do there is client oriented. It's very important to understand that. It's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, it's selling effects, it's selling plain vanilla derivatives, it's doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients, Admitzize and SME clients. This is basically the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the US. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIV in the US. This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in four or five particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe in the US, which by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing. This is a size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator. You're going to see that revenue is going to start to pick up in CIV pretty fast given that because it's already a complement as I was saying of the rest of the business. Tax rate in Brazil next year, Eurasian, sorry, taxes on on capital, that's been proposed and discussed is not approved and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed. The finance minister believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that because the main reason for that is to tax companies that are not paying taxes. The banks are paying already lots of taxes. So I think we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take, but by no means is a done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented. Thank you, Marta. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for the presentation. From a side, a quick question on revenue performance, we will explain how NIR has been the key driver of revenue momentum. However, going back to the capital market day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be on the performing a little bit or initial expectation. Could you elaborate on that? Is that the market momentum as weekend, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that you are running behind your initial plan? And second, when you talk about the cost of resuscitationality in the US, could you explain a little bit better why is that? And why there is such a concentration in traditions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand. And lastly, on reporting changes, I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the regional commercial and new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional PNL and balance sheets for each subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail? Thank you very much. Thank you Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market. No, if you see the fees, for example, in the first nine months, we grew 6% year-on-year, okay? It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, no? Mainly CIV and payments, okay? It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income, okay? And by 25, that would increase from 42 to 50%. So basically, according to our plan, okay? It's important also that risk-capitite increase is changing the portfolio mix, okay? And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out, okay? And we see also, and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue exactly what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIV that is basically up 15% year-on-year. Pagonex is a payment side and merchant acquiring is up to 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, you know? Because exactly what's happening in the market? The auto business is generating 5% more across the board, okay? You see very good performance in Mexico and the US and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have, okay? So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to start into come up also helping out by what's the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly, okay? So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well and also as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the field revenue. That's basically what has been one of the laggers, the field revenue, okay? The seasonality in the US is has always been like that. I mean, that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marketing the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, etc. The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the US and also that people basically don't want to refine other cars or don't see the availability of loans and cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out and that's why you see better numbers and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today and was expected to continue, okay? And also the change of mix is getting us out, okay? So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind. In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment, okay? So you will continue to have that information. I don't know, Jose, if I left anything out? No, no, no, I think we will report as we manage the bank, so we will report these horizontal businesses as the primary segments obviously, but we will continue sector-set providing all the information from a country level upwards, so you will be able to see the country's performance organized by these businesses and the global performance organized by countries, so you will be able to have both views at the same time. Thank you Carlos. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Alba Rosarano from Morgan Stanley. Hi, sorry for earlier. A couple of questions, one is really a follow-up and thanks very much for your steer on provisions for 2024. If I can sort of take advantage of, you open that door, in the context of what we've seen in the US, within flat provision, what direction or a bit of color, how could we expect the US evolve in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 6065. It was 58, I think you put the number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings, and now you have student loans picking up. Is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024, or do you think it could take more time to just understand how you're thinking about the US within that flat group context? And the second, hopefully easier one, is on the UK, you've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the UK as a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there specifically for UK, given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough comedy, on deposits you had your own offering out in September, so maybe you got more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Alberto. Actually, I was expecting your question on the US, so let me give you exactly what is the important, different dynamic that car has to student loans and different things. The car in the US is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe as in Latin America, actually people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage, and then the auto loan, etc. In the US is the other way around. The US, if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean, you're completely isolated. So the behavior of the auto loans in the US is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. That's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. That's exactly why the behavior of the link when it's basically coming from in that way. Normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60 to 62, 63 percent maybe going up. Let's see how the US evolves and if we have a soft landing or not that will only depend on that. Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio as we have set already. That's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in-prime and in-ear-prime. Even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk and the way. But we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio and also we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, etc. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that and very cautious on the way we manage in cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly. And then on the UK, the UK, as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of one transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there leading to probably and the UK is leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming it and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the UK with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities. NIAI has grown year on year 9.3. I was driven by higher rates as you know and we have a really strong focus on managing spreads and profitability. So you see that we have been lowering the portfolio that because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean we are as the rest of the market at 2.2. But we are offsetting the increased cost of retail funding and slowdown of new year regulations by basically playing in that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities. It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability of head of market share. Okay. And we have lower risk appetite as I told you. And we believe that we could have an immense pension by doing that. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Andrea Filtre from MedioBanca. Please go ahead. Yes. Good morning. First question on if you can remind us of the Brazilian interest rate sensitivity. Second question is follow up on several questions from colleagues. If you can actually give us a concrete indication of the structural tax rate in Brazil and in the US in light of the new electric vehicles leading that you're doing. Is this a structural move or is just a one-off that we've seen? Then on capital, given that you are confirming your 15 to 17% target with a 15% for this year, should we not see also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate? And finally, digital euro. What do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation have you budgeted the impact to your business model and can you share it with us? Thank you. Thank you Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro and then Jose will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital. First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and is a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated that discussions should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June 24. And they're saying that instead they were examining and in a quiet and slow way by the new Commission and the new Parliament. So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense. In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized the investigation phase of the digital euro, as they said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a two-year preparation phase as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will evolve finalizing in the rulebook and the selection selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important and this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen. And as a decision on the digital euro, I don't believe we'll not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't spec to release before 2016. On this context, I mean, us as Van Gogh Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the digital euro. Also developed the Pan-European integrated payments market is basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe and also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and the implementation phase. Okay. So that's a way we see it at this point. With this, I will basically pass it to Jos\\u00e9 to tell you. Hello Andrea. Brazil's interest rate sensitivity is 150 million euros to a drop of 100 basis points or things been equal. Tax rate, in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the US. And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation. We don't expect any significant regulatory charges or the other than the ones we mentioned and obviously always subject to available for sale, impacts, etc. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital build up. So you're right. I mean, the higher the higher the profitability, the better. We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk weighted assets across the group. In the first nine months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around 15 to 18 billion in risk weighted assets. We think we can do more or less 30 billion or close to 30 billion, 25 to 30 this year. And that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet. So on our balance sheet. So the focus going forward is going to be the optimizing risk weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So you're right that we would expect the capital build up to accelerate in the coming quarters. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Pablo de la Torre quebas, from RBC. Please go ahead. Hi and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on credit cards in Brazil. Could you please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country? And if possible, could you please give us any indication of the contribution to Brazilian NII of these types of lending? And any estimate that you can give us on the potential penalty impact of the new measures announced? I guess besides the negative impact to NII, are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality? And are there any offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pablo. Hoso will tell you basically about the situation in Brazil. Again, these are ongoing negotiations. I just already referred to Interstone Capital. Here again, the focus is more on corporates than financials. Obviously, there might be an effect on banks, but that's not the main focus. But in our case, it would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as it has been proposed. But again, we think that will change credit cards. The 90-day period for self-regulation is already counting and is finalizing by year end. We do not expect an agreement here. So probably by sending the Bankers Association in Brazil, sorry, the central bank in Brazil will have to regulate. There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a modeling which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principle, which is called the UK model. Again, Sandandair and Febra Banda, the Bankers Association, are already working with the central bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on Nenai, but there might be ways of offsetting this through commission income, etc. Because there is a lot of significant rotation of the balances in Brazil. So again, working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank, BPI, please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good morning, Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank. A couple of questions from my side as well in a few minutes. So on NNII, a minor detail, but in my majority, but in Portugal you have a 40% quarter and quarter in Greece. In NNII, this quarter, I see the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the previous quarter. You do have an increase in the alcohol portfolio, but in any case, I was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution and also what should we expect in coming quarters. Then on the UK and NNII as well, I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect, I feel at previously, or you were wondering about a high single digit increase in NNI in the UK for this year, you expect that to be the case still and how do you see it evolving into next year. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you Carlos. NNII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal, no. It's been helping us out basically because of the reprising of the portfolio, the rates we're going. I believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe, so that will help out and then we'll stabilize. That's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time and we don't see more growth in that sense. NNII should stabilize in Portugal. In terms of the UK, I explained quite well exactly what's going on. If I made before you go. Just to give some more color on Portugal. When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3 in the first quarter, 4 in the second, 4.6 in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14, 26, 38, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days. All of this may explain the differences. But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent. I would expect, as Ektor said, obviously, there is a limit to the reprising of assets. Mortgage is in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the six-month Uriber, not the 12-month Uriber in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of the post-us in Portugal is really, really low and we don't see any competition there. So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. Thank you, Jose. Very quickly on the UK carlos. As I said, basically, we continue to put profitability ahead of market share. We have lower risk appetite given the dynamics on that market. And we combined that and we would like to combine that with the wood performance with that basically could lead to an immense pension. But answering your question, I expect in 2023 with a high single digit growth and on high rates management of the deposit cost, well, we assume the lower volumes that we have. And that's basically the outlook that we have for the UK at this point. I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to compliment what I think with that, I answer your question. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Blita Smith from autonomous. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one will be on the NRI in Spain. The customer spread widened and you've also increased the alcohol portfolio, but the NIMO is flat. So maybe you can explain what's happened there and also give us an update on the alcohol portfolio. And the second one will be on Chile. We've seen a big decline in NRI here. I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year. But what do you think is the outlook there for this year and also when will the NRI improve in 2024? Thanks. Thank you, Blita. I will start basically, give you the overall view and then Jose can give you a little bit more of details on both. I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most from the higher rates. And we continue to see, as I said, a strong growth from clients. We have a 651,000 new customers, net new customers in the last 12 months. We see also a strong contribution from the global businesses. Wealth management is increasing 84% year-in-year. CIV 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And CIV is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that. We expect double digit NRI growth in 23. Okay. And in terms, we see very factors to consider. We see as Jose explained you in detail assets reprising at least during the first half of 24. Okay. Clients continue to grow and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no minimum, no meaningful deposit moments in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. The deposit basis is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of 20,000 euros, which basically contributes to the stability. Also, it's very important to take into account that the one transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well. And we're very focused on the product simplification, as I said, where we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. Okay. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to have. Exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. Yeah. Rita, let me tell you, Elon loans. This is the same explanation that we have of Portugal. In quarter and quarter, it basically has to do with many, many, probably many small things. But when you look at Elon, Elon loans in Spain, from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5, first quarter, 3.3, second quarter, 3.8, fourth quarter, 4.3. So very much, almost an Australian line increase. And in the case of the deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53, 72, 19, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat. So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprise up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages is 77 billion and around 60% reprise is in the first half. So I think the Elon loans will continue although the rates interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe might stay flat. The reprise in of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year. And in terms of the pressure on the cost of the deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already reprised. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. So to what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits. And we think that is a limited amount. So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of the deposits. In Chile, we have two balance sheets. So two sensitivities to the balance sheet one is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So we see an IIM Brazil actually expanding, again, gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantial in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year. Because again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the UF and rates. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Hugo Cruz from KBW, please go ahead. I think for the time you go from KBW, just a couple of questions. Mexico and I, the growth of Q&A will be quite strong. I guess I'm not going to ask you why it's been stronger than expected by one. If you could give guidance for the full year, what kind of an agro to you expecting years? And then finally on Argentina, quite volatile, and we have elections soon. So I was wondering if you can give what to expect or impact from the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. Thank you. Thank you. Mexico, as you have seen, has been a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and on secure loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before. So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio. So it's quite important to see that. We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months. And I believe it's going to grow strongly also on 24. The important thing to understand is actually how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the US. Both I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on 24 and continue to have very good growth on NIA. Okay, in terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really, and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks at may things stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the, in the exchange rate, between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the, in the black market. So in that sense, let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult tasks they have in front. Now, the just one final comment here, the way we've managed Argentina is to have, we're trying to hedge, obviously, against inflation, and hedging our investment against inflation. And that will continue to be the key element. Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and unofficial exchange rates. We are aware of that. We are aware of the impact that a devaluation could have on our books. So we are managing that to minimize the impact if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our investment in Brazil, but basically by managing and investing inflation risk. Thank you very much. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Fernando Gil de Santibanes from West Inverte, please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Thank you, please. First of all, I'm Peter Puchino-Bank. I see the current possible focus 11% still have reached off from the target, but 15%. Then you have for the ban, can you please comment the outlook for 2024? Please, this is the first one. The second would be about the alcohol portfolio. I see an increase in about 10 billion in the quoted. Can you please request strategy? Can the level of unrealized loss of e-calflux portfolio and highly unfolded? If you can please comment on the outlook for the extension on the mortgage holidays, please. Thank you very much. So let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We are going to have a new government and this will have to go to parliament. So very early stages of this proposal and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal if any will be conducted because again this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government. The Alcozory also briefed us about this and I forgot. We have more or less 27, almost 30 billion of alcohol in Spain at an average yield of around 3. 4%. We expect to end the year at around 30 billion. We might increase the alcohol a little bit more next year, obviously taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of the process or against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability but obviously this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year. Yes, on this C.B. There has been a particular change in the business in this year. In this C.B. in particular, there is one very important. We had a really good growth in terms of loans but the majority of those loans at the vast majority is basically stock financing. Okay, giving the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months. First of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now the basically we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start that the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. Okay, so that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve. It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale and also you're going to see a dynamic or what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans directly to individuals. Okay, so we believe that the outlook would be good. It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. One final comment here, although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously the higher the rates the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because of the way we do not have sensitivity to that movement. Obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that one point I wanted to make. The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitization, etc. So a range is to try to minimize that like Ektor was saying by managing the assets that we have on our books. Thank you. Can we have the last question please? Last question from Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I've got the F3 followers. The first one is on the NIA in Brazil. I mean, I used to stick into the guidance you gave in Q2, that Q4 would be better than Q3. And if you can give a little bit of color in terms of the pattern of NIA expansion next year, QB is expecting like a linear increase through the year. You're going to have some degree of seasonality at some point. The second one is on the US. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but one has driven the 13 percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the unit. And the third one is on capital return, giving you comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of a positive or do you see any chances of stopping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in 24. Thank you. Thank you. Look Ignacio, in terms of NIA in Brazil, I think it's important. I mean, we rate the rate first of all, as I have seen the worst of the NIA is behind us. We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NIA in the coming quarters. Okay. Rates as Hoss explained to you have started to curve down. I mean, 100 basis points in the Q323. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 1175. So that's basically tells you, we're flattening the Q2. The clinging rates proscrate activity increasing plus market related NIA no longer a drag. NIA improvements. So that basically tells you that we, yes, we believe that the second, sorry, that the four quarters is going to be better than the third. Okay. In terms of what do we see in the future, it's exactly as Hoss explained you is that we see a trend going upwards towards more towards the second half of the year next year. Okay. And that's the way we see it is going to help out if rates continue to come down and Bolleux continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point. All right. In terms of the US coverage, okay. It's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed, okay. And we have an update in long to values include the current value of the cars, okay. And in addition of the quarters, we have CRE charges due to the angry rating of several companies in the sector and in FinTech charges due to origination in that sense, but I see that this would normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said, okay. So in that sense, I don't see a problem that is also there was an increasing provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with a GST remediation, but other than that, I think it's quite what it was quite normal. Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77, okay. And it's below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is about the total all portfolio is flat year and year, 2.7. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital we turn, please Jose. No, I think that's for the board to decide. So for this year, the policy has been decided and that's for the board to decide, obviously. Thank you. I believe we have no questions. So thank you very much, everybody, for your time. As always, the Investor Relations team remains at your disposal for any and all questions that you may have. Thank you.

            "[[\"Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year.\", 'Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website.', 'But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us.', \"First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, José will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion.\", \"That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions.\", 'We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain.', 'Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion.', 'If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom.', 'Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected.', 'Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate.', 'Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year.', 'The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024.', \"As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains.\", 'Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022.', 'This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth.', 'From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively.', 'In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends.', \"In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy.\", 'At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year.', 'While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months.', 'Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail.', 'We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight.', 'First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group.', \"The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online.\", 'We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US.', 'Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment.', 'Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas.', 'The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control.', 'We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year.', 'Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year.', \"CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability.\", 'As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits.', 'Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries.', 'In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms.', 'As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services.', \"Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform.\", 'We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth.', 'Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation.', 'Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing.', 'Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders.', \"I leave you now with José or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please José. José, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance.\", 'Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina.', 'Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%.', 'So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter.', 'We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year.', 'Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year.', 'Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year.', 'As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing.', 'This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US.', 'We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging.', 'Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher.', 'In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment.', 'This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue.', 'We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter.', 'Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses.', \"We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance.\", 'Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer.', 'Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation.', 'By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years.', \"Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries.\", \"Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels.\", 'Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels.', 'Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout.', 'There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity.', 'Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re伎ed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re伎ed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more.', \"That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate.\", 'And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer.', 'Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year.', 'This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025.', \"Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you.\", 'Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it.', 'And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25.', 'So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail.', \"Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see.\", 'I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically José to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments.', 'With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging.', 'We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters.', 'The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage.', \"It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves.\", 'This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect.', \"Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag.\", 'So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good.', \"We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect.\", \"I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail.\", \"Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds.\", 'Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well.', 'For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account.', \"It's very important to understand what the model changes about.\", \"The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho.\", 'Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter.', 'We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end.', \"Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions.\", \"Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I.\", 'If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you.', \"Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask José to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina.\", \"In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points.\", \"And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead.\", \"Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks.\", \"First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits.\", \"Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please.\", \"There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead.\", \"Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.\", \"Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates.\", 'Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you.', \"Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye turtle\"], [\"Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first half of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektor Grisi, and our steer for Mr. José García Candera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for all and any questions you may have in the Q&A session.\", \"If you would like to ask a question, please press star 5 on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Ektor, the floor is yours. Thank you, Reganiam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. First, we talk about our H1 results in the context of our strategy. Then José will then review your financial performance in greater detail. And then I will conclude with some final messages.\", 'As Reganiam said, we will then open the floor for your questions. The main highlights of our results in the first half of 2024 are the following. Q2 was another record quarter for Santander, who chose the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reach 3.2 billion, thus 20% above Q2 23, even after the impact of 450 million euros of one-time charges, net of taxes and minorities. In them, recurring profit was 3.7 billion in Q2.', 'Profit in the first half reached 6.1 billion euros, also a record high of 16%, supported by the strong-cost and revenue growth in all regions and global businesses. We continue to accelerate one transformation to become simpler, more automated, and more integrated. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved by 261 basis points to 41.6%, the best in 15 years. And our eternal tangible equity rose 137 basis points to 15.9%, or 16.3 if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain.', 'Finally, our solid balance sheet with a sand capital ratio, solid credit quality and a street capital discipline helped us reach strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation with TNAF plus dividend per share increasing 12%. Let us stop for a moment in our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them.', 'With that quarter, we have reported variation in constant euros in all countries, except Argentina, which is shown in current euros to mitigate the distortions from hyperinflation. In Q2, we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects. Although it has little impact when comparing half years, distortions are more significant when we compare with Q1.', 'Our opinion is strong from top to bottom. Revenue was all-time high with record NII and fees supported by all global businesses and regions. Second, expenses increased below inflation and below revenue on good cost management. And cost has been stable for four quarters in a row. Third, we have reported net operating income growing double digit for nine consecutive quarters demonstrating the sustainability of our results. Fourth, long-lost provisions continue to normalize as expected.', 'The highest profit ever, as I mentioned before, was achieved even after one-time charges. These were 210 additional Swiss mortgage provision in Poland reaching coverage of 100%. 240 million from the write-down of our matching platform in Germany and super digital in Latin America that I will explain in more detail later on. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-offs impact in Brazil, which do not affect profit and have been netted in the underlying PNL.', 'This, as you can see, is a strong first half of the year with solid commercial and business dynamics that already puts us ahead of our plan for 2024. As a result, we have upgraded some of our targets for the year. We have increased our revenue growth target to high single digit with better NII and fee income. We have improved our efficiency ratio target to around 42% as accelerating one transformation leads to higher operational leverage.', 'And we have raised our road to target to about 16% versus the previous 16%. We are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year. Cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around 1.2% on active risk management and strong labor markets. As a reference, year to day cost of risk was 1.17% even with additional provisions that I just described in Poland.', 'In capital, our city one ratio ended June at 12.5%, with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above 12%, even after the Basel III implementation. One transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind our record performance, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes plus our active spread management have already contributed 266 basis points of efficiencies since we started.', \"Our global businesses continue to push a group's profitability and have delivered 87 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 71 basis points in efficiencies so far. As we have often said, we are going back to basics, which supports value creation based on profitable growth. How? By focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience. And by obtaining the operational leverage from a global platforms and come on tech.\", 'This is reflected in the performance of our global businesses. A retail and consumer business as efficiency ratio improved by 480 basis points and 270 basis points respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business. Leveraging our expertise to grow in the US maintaining a risk profile. We have seen new growth 6% another record supported by the strong performance and client flows in the US.', 'Wealth continued is a strong growth improving efficiency and profitability and in payments where we manage over 100 million cards in the group we have significantly improved profitability. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year we had a one-time fee from a commercial agreement in Brazil excluding this impact, payments revenue would be 6% up and efficiency would have improved by 113 basis points even after investing in the global platforms.', \"In the coming five slides, I will review the advances on each of our global businesses. Let's start with retail. We are working to become the number one bank for customers. It is a great example of the benefits from one transformation. Innovation helps to offer the best customer experience. In Mexico, for example, our new digital processes helped onboarding time and led to our record 90,000 digital account openings just last month.\", 'A common operating model across our banks, automation and digitalization free some time of our people to focus on commercial activities. The education of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped 8%. Versus last year. Deployment of our global platform has continued. In the US, it has been successfully completed. Within the group, gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Mexico, Brazil and Chile.', \"And it is processing a number of transactions that is around 20% higher year-on-year. Financial, we are extracting the potential from today's favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our diversification. We carefully manage margins in the higher for longer rate environment in Europe and keep capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in South America. And while we achieve a strong operational leverage across the group.\", 'As a result, our profit grew 35% year-on-year, rate of 430 basis points to 18.1 on the back of revenue of double digit on good performance of NIIAM fees with all regions growing, especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 4% in real terms reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels. In consumer, we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers.', \"Our best in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, last year we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct out-of-players, which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their out-of-finance online and to end in very little time. We are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase NII stability and autonomous funding across the interest rate cycle. The deposits were 14% year-on-year supported by our digital solutions.\", \"We expect positive trends to continue, helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. In checkout lending, we recently launched stalled-man's loans with Apple in Germany through SINIA, which we are looking to spend to other European countries.\", 'We have a great quarter-on-its operational leverage, which resulted in double-deget growth in net operating income and a 4% profit increase in H1. With number one, strong revenue, driven by positive commercial dynamics with higher volumes, mainly in Europe or Brazil, good and AI performance and 27% fee growth from insurance. Number two, cost-falling 3% in real terms on the execution of our strategic and efficiency plans executed last year.', 'And third, higher provisions mainly Swiss-Franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in Europe and the US. Volume and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that consumer will end 24 with a profit growth of around double-deget even after the normalization of provisions. We are building a work-class CAB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile.', 'We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions. Our collaboration in the US with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts. For example, we made our first corporate share buy back for a US company. And we were appointed global coordinator for a US listed IPO for the first time ever.', 'In Mexico, we are creating a significant partnership within the Mexico-US corridor leveraging our global markets and US bank built-out initiatives. And these are just a few examples from a long list. As a result, revenue in the CAB in the US rose 33% year-on-year. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our US banking build-out initiative which will become even more evident in the coming quarters.', 'We continue to spend and strengthen our centers of expertise including key industry groups such as chemicals, technology, and paper and packaging. Our CAB business is capital-wide very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good-paced year-on-year. Our active capital management continues to support great trade-off and high profitability levels.', 'In essence, CAB had great results, increasing revenue in H1 6% year-on-year even after our record first half in 23, making H1 the best ever with fees growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows. Moving on to wealth management and insurance, we continue to build the best bank private bank and insurance van er in Europe and the Americas.', 'Now, number one, by improving customer relationships through the best service and raise solutions resulting in double digit growth in private banking customers. Second, collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CAB, which is a major driver for growth and allows us to capture net-bought-brand feeds. Collaboration fees increased by 12% year-on-year.', 'Third, developing global platforms across all three businesses and digitalized distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. A good example of this is AutoCompara, our auto insurance comparison engine that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. A Tributable Profit rose double digit on a strong private banking activity.', 'In a favorable interest rate environment, we total fees for all three businesses growing at double digit and cost top slightly in real terms. Finally, efficiency improved 230 basis points year-on-year and Rote rose to 350 basis points to over 80%. Finally, payments where we have a unique positions on both sides of the value chain, one issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-goid and second in merchant acquiring.', \"In merchant, we are the second largest acquiring Latin America and a market leader in Spain and Portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability. We are gaining market share in most markets as we as trends get net's customer value proposition with new global solution, an example is dynamic currency conversion in Mexico, which has helped get net to become second in Mexico with a 20% market share and a 47% EBDA margin in Q2.\", \"We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to Pag-on-X global platform to leverage the group's scale. The transactions managed globally through Pag-on-X payments surpassed one billion per year during the first half of this year with 30% growth quarter-on-quarter. The rollout of PLARV, our global card's platform, is on track. We continue to increase the number of debit cards managing PLARV at a good pace and we're starting the migration of the debit portfolio.\", 'We plan to manage around 15 million cards through PLARV in Brazil by year end. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded one of the charges in Pag-on-X from the right down of investments. One is a discontinuation of our merchant platform in Germany, we announced in June as we are focusing on our current acquiring value proposition in our core markets, where we have a very competitive business.', 'The other one is our decision to write down super digital, a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and maximize operational leverage. These decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business, reducing fixed cost going forward. Excluding these impacts, underlying performance was very positive.', 'Profit in payments was up 30% year-on-year on good revenue performance, cost falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms and sound credit quality in cards. Pag-on-X EBDA margin improved to 20% one of the best among competitors. We expect a consistent execution of our strategy, efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters.', 'Today results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in H1, with double-ease shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter. The quarter was 16.3% of 134 paces points year-on-year reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are re-inni- re-inni-ting new visas. EPS rose to nearly 37 cents, thus around 20% year-on-year and we delivered 12% growth in shareholder value creation.', 'Supported all by strong profit generation are a three-disciplinary capital allocation and sharerival. We have reported around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, returning around 6.5 billion through buybacks and providing a return on investment of 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jose to go into our financial performance in more detail. Please Jose. Thank you, Ector and good morning everyone.', 'Like always, I will go into a bit more detail in the P&L and the capital ratio. But let me start by making some general comments. The first one is that our record profits include, as Ector mentioned, 450 million from one-offs, coming basically from the right downs in Pagonext and additional provisions in the Swiss Frank mortgage portfolio in Poland.', 'We also had a one-off in Brazil related to capital gain from the transaction we announced with Sodexo, but we used that amount to strengthen the balance sheet, so no impact on the bottom line.', 'But if these results, as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage, with very positive momentum both in Europe and in Latin America at the same time, revenue grew 9% with the highest 10 AI and fee income in our history, and costs were down slightly in real terms as a result operating income was up 14%. The returns increased even after including the 200 million increase in Swiss Frank provisions that we took in the quote.', \"On the right hand side, you can see the about training profit quarter on quarter at 12%, which was driven by a top-line growth with lower cost and provisions fairly flat, as I just mentioned. Let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why we're starting to use a new inflation adjusted exchange rate in Argentina, rather than the official one.\", 'We have observed the significant divergence between the official exchange rate and inflation, and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach. The new exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with the differential between the inflation in Argentina and in the US. This is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in Argentina.', 'And this should mitigate the volatility that the currency might experience in the future, as you all remember, was the case in 2023. Following these accounting rules, we have recorded a full Q1 and Q2 impacts from this adjustment in Q2, which does not significantly affect the year-on-year figures, but it has significant impact and causes some distortions when we look at quarter and quarter. And I will try to show these differences in the coming slides.', 'For instance, NII is dropping, is down 4% in the quarter, but if we exclude Argentina, the groups in NII would have gone up 2%. Since similar happens with fees, instead of decreasing in the quarter, increasing 1%, they would have increased 3%, and cause would have been fairly flat. If this exchange rate does not materialize, we would revert this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today.', 'It looks to us that this is a prudent, more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in Argentina. There was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue.', 'This strong growth was primarily supported by retail, retail accounts, you know, for more than 50% of our businesses, and is growing at double digits with very good performance in NII across regions and fees also growing, especially in the Americas, and also consumer, which is reaching good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong growth in Europe and Latin.', 'Corporate investment banking also had a good quarter, a revenue reach in all time high, both in the quarter and in the first half of the year, particularly in Spain, in the US and in Mexico. Also double digit growth in wealth, as mentioned, as sector mentioned, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payments also perform very well, particularly we exclude the one time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of 23 years.', \"You remember which we explained, and the sector just mentioned, where we had a one-off from an agreement with MasterCard. And finally, the corporate center's high liquidity buffer remuneration was upset by higher telecom rail issuances and the negative impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued to increase in the quarter if we exclude Argentina, particularly driven by retail, consumer and CIV, which represented 95% of groups in NII.\", 'On the slide, you can see that we are in this small box in red, putting the figure that we would have recorded if we had used the official Argentina exchange rate. So this is important, keep this in mind, and to show again that we have decided to do is a prudent account of our profits coming from Argentina.', 'NII rose 11% year-on-year, supported by all businesses and regions, on the back of very active price management in retail Europe, especially in deposits, also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, in consumer South America, in retail South America, in consumer, sorry, which is now very evident in Brazil, especially in Brazil and Chile, and very good levels of activity in corporate investment banking.', \"In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, explained by higher yield assets as we continue reprising our books, but also very good management of the positive costs, which basically outweated the pressures that we are seeing. It's true that the margin is expanding, as you can see, if we exclude Argentina, or if we had used the official exchange rate, so overall the margin management, pricing management on both the asset side and liability side is really strong.\", \"We see a slight deterioration though if we use our official exchange rate or our adjusted exchange rate, although it's not very significant in the quarter, going forward, we would expect some marginal, margin pressure in Europe that will be more than compensated by positive contribution from the Americas and our consumer business.\", 'In the context of low-fee growth in general across the sector, as a result of sub-dute loan demand, we generated another record quarter in FINCAM at 6.5 billion euros, with solid growth all across the five businesses, retail increase 3%, basically driven by Brazil, North American, Poland, outstanding performance in consumer, on the back of very strong insurance businesses.', 'Corporate investment banking also grew from already at very high levels in the first quarter, in the first half of last year, especially in the US, wealth supported by very strong private banking activity, and payments that, as we mentioned, was affected by the one time fee recorded in Brazil last year.', 'Structural efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter after quarter, most income was 41.6%, the best level that we have reported for the last 15 years, and one of the best in the sector, is already better than the levels that we guided for 2024.', \"Cost declined, quarter and quarter, we're very flattish if we exclude Argentina, after having been stable for the last three quarters, we've revenue growing steadily quarter after quarter, improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have in the second half of the year and in 2025. Abrage inflation continued its gradual decline down from 12% a year ago to below 4% this quarter.\", 'In this context, cost fell 1% in real terms year and year, despite that, as you all know, we have some lack of effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs, and our investments in transformation.', \"By businesses, cost remain well under control in retail, consumer and payments, we've represented, we've represented 80% of our cost base, and 80% of the increase, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, came from CIB, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our corporate investment banking franchise. In fact, if we exclude this investment, cost in the rest of the group, would have decreased 3% in real terms.\", 'The equality remained very much under control, obviously supported by stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group. Cost of risk was 1.21%. Remember that we look at the last 12 months. If we look at the first half of the year, cost of risk was 1.17%. And including the increase in the provisions for the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Argentina. So we are very much on target to reach the 1.2% for the year, and we reiterate that target.', 'In the second half, we expect that trends in consumer and Mexico will be closer to more normalized levels, but this will be offset by a better performance in retail Europe and South America. Turning to capital and closing my section here, our city one ratio remains at a very comfortable level, backed by strong organic capital generation and significant risk weighted asset rotation.', 'This quarter we generated 52 basis points organically, supported by our asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic risk weighted asset growth. We recorded 25 basis points charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. And finally, there was a seven basis point negative impact mainly related to intangibles, the valuation of available for sale portfolios and others. There were not significant regulatory impacts in the quarter.', 'We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulted in a new book, Return on Risk Weighted Assets, of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our backbook at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims at optimizing capital deployment, is achieving outstanding results.', 'The first half, we disposed of an amount of capital equivalent of 30 billion in risk weighted assets, at the cost of capital of half of that of the new originations. In addition, the one third of our balance sheet that materials every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at this Return on Tangeable Equity of 23%. The combination of these actions explain the expanding profitability and increasing capital ratio. Let me turn it now back to actor for his conclusions.', 'Thank you Jose. As our results clearly show, we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025 in our last investor day. Thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy. With the strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to about 16%. By growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 12% value creation to our shareholders.', 'We set it in our investor day and I want to remind you again, we have entered a new phase of value creation for our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident. The strong growth in revenue with flatish cost and around 20% growth in EPS. And the first ever H1 profit with all time high NII fees and et operating income backed by strong performance in our businesses and regions.', \"Sustained progress in our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both high revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we expect to exceed some of our targets for 24. We are upgrading our revenue growth target to high single digits.\", 'Efficiency to run 42%. And as we deployed capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, we are improving our profitability target to above 16%. Our focus at Santander is to be reliable in providing returns that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value consistently and through the cycle based on both business and your graphic diversification.', 'The progress of the last 10 years to simplify an aligned model in all our businesses and now deploy your own tech stack is already evident and now depends on execution to continue to deliver on our primary target of double digit TNAF plus DPS growth through the cycle. And now we will be happy to take all your questions. Thank you. Thank you Jose Nector. We can start the Q&A session now please. Thank you. If you wish to ask the question, please press a style 5 on the telephone.', 'We already have our first question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, this is the P from taking organ. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question would be on the risk transfers. Did I hear correctly that you saw 30 billion of risk-graded asset disposal in the quarter? And maybe you could just talk about the decline in risk-graded assets. I see risk-graded assets, especially in Spain, were down around 2% quarter and quarter.', 'In digital consumer bank minus 1% quarter and quarter, but in both entities, the loan grew by 3% quarter and quarter. So how should we think about these SRTs or securitization and what will be the revenue in best going forward from securitizing some of the loans. And also related to that, if you could just remind us on the regulatory gap ahead when coming in the second half. Then my second question would be on e-berry.', \"There has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you're looking to potentially IPO e-berry. Can you just remind us what the tangible book value for a share is for the tangible book value for these businesses, how much revenue do you get from e-berry and what your kind of plans for e-berries? Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. I mean, first of all, our policy basically has been as Jose was explaining in detail to rotate the balance sheet as much as we can.\", \"This is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to re-inate assets. So this is basically helping us to rotate. And also giving us a new, basically I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something, we basically reuse that capital, already deploy the capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way.\", \"As Jose was explaining to you, we rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on profitability, we're actually re-investing better and better. And that's actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank. Then Jose can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory charges, et cetera.\", \"So we continue to basically hang on to that number. 12% above 12% will be, and as we, and as I said, and Jose basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well. And in terms of the IPO of E-VII, we'll give you the details, Jose will give you the details on that. Thank you Jose. Hi, Sophie. First of all, the 30 billion was re-sweeted as it's in the first half.\", 'So more or less 40% of these is SRTs, but the rest is all the types of transactions, like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this 30 billion was around in-rote equivalent. We always look at Rorwa, but just to use the same currency everywhere in-rote equivalent, the cost of mobilizing this 30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on this 30 billion in res-wated assets.', \"So in-rote equivalent, this 30 billion is close to 4 billion in capital times this 13%. So on an analyzed basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around 500 million. We expect to continue doing this. The man-for-private credit is significant. We have a very busy second half of the year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera. But we expect to mobilize much more than last year.\", \"And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital hell wings this year. We still expect 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Ektor mentioned, fully loaded. And when we mentioned fully loaded, it's fully loaded, even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will be comfortably above 12%. And the day one impacts will be very relatively small as we mentioned before.\", \"And in the case of Avery, we are always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there were some news that we are contemplated on IPO in Avery. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital. This is one of them that doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again, this will be put as one of our several capital managed many initiatives that we have across the group. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?\", 'Next question from Ignacio Larghi from BNP Paripa. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is on the revenue performance. We have seen a very good performance in Europe. Probably a bit better than what we expected, at least I expect the other beginning of the year. A lot of them has been lagging a bit behind with their field being softer. How should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half?', \"When you have upgraded the revenue guidance to rising the digit from the 9% currently, so we expect second half in line with these levels, kind of getting a bit of a sense whether LATAM should have set the weakness of Europe that you have flagged during the call in margin. And the second question is on the UK, if you could elaborate a bit, what should we expect in terms of NII for the UK? Looks, names, and it's not a lie saying so try to get in your thoughts on the outlook for the UK.\", \"Thank you. Thank you, Ignacio. First of all, let me tell you, as you have said, revenue has been very strong. Much stronger that we believe that the beginning rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different businesses. As you know, we're very focused on profitability in the way we're structuring things and not basically spaying off. All right. I believe that I mean revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that LATAM has a weakness.\", \"I see that actually LATAM is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can see also very good results coming out of what they're doing in retail in Brazil, okay? Also Chile is doing quite a good performance. Mexico, basically on retail, we're changing the mix and that's why you see the flat, the flat and IE on there, but I mean it will continue to give very good results. So respect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue.\", 'And in that sense, on basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was per a very second half. First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also, some of the strategies have done in terms of betas are paying off, okay? So I believe that all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen.', \"In terms of detail, basically is a more rational behavior as I told you. Fees are not going to be doing that well due to the switcher campaign that was structured and both benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter much better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the UK which are going to make the business perform a much better than we saw.\", \"I don't know, Jose, we'd like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but I think I'm sure that you will ask about NIA. You mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NIA in the Eurozone. We now see NIA in the Eurozone, particularly in Spain, Portugal, etc. Up, mid-single digits, obviously rates are higher for longer. So much better performance in NIA.\", 'We have hatched a substantial amount of our balance sheets in the Eurozone, basically through the alco portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages, and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of RENIA in Europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before. So as Ektor mentioned, we expect fairly stable.', \"Maybe it's slightly down in NIA in Spain in the second half of the year and next year, but at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from South America, Brazil and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future revolution of NIA and revenue in the second half. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Ávaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning.\", \"I asked a couple of follow-ups on just on the question, the comment you've just made around mid-single digit in Spain and I. That implies I think almost 9% production, half on half, which feels a bit substantial. So I don't know if my math is very quickly wrong or if you can add a bit of color on that. And then on the performance and fees in the US, could you give us a bit of color on the obviously very strong performance?\", \"But if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM, DCM, just a performance opinion of how sustainable it is going forward. If I can slip in a third, you've mentioned the over 12% capital, but I thought the target was 12 and a half percent of the end of the year. So can you just go from that to the case and you please should still expect that 2030 based points will be at once. Thank you. Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital.\", \"In capital, we have always said we're going to be above 12%. And that basically has been the guidance we're at 12 and a half right now. And we set as Jose basically rated that we're going to be above 12% even after base of three fully loaded. That's exactly the guidance. In terms of performance in the US, FIS, the majority is basically the CIV. A business, a CIV is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that we're having a little bit also in the US.\", \"But CIV is a main driver. It's been growing. It grew 38% year on year, 1.3% quarter on quarter. As you know, CIV business is cyclical. So we have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well. And also, a very good connection in between what we're doing with the US, as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the business in Europe.\", \"What's happening, and let me explain a little bit, is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of this EM that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, were becoming one. And you see us top three in the league tables right now in Latin America doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates, but also to the governments.\", \"I mean, when UMS did their transaction at the beginning of the year, 7.5 billion, we were one of the principal book runners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the B-forpe that we did in the US. So that's starting to pay off. I believe that with the four teams that we added, I think we're going to complement the rest of the business, have we continue driving fees up, but let's see what happens with the cyclicality of the business.\", 'On the other side, Ristael is also performing well in fees, and we believe that he continues to do so over the rest of the year. In terms of what we give to, in terms of Spain, party performance, loans are starting to reprise lower at the lower rates, but the deposits bet us are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of the deposits.', \"Also as Jose explained, you in detail, alcohol volumes are helping, and the lower cost of the hatching, which were not in place before, are now in place, so it's going to help us. In the United, as Jose said, it's reaching to speak, but I expect the United to world mid-single digit in 24, better performance that we expected at the beginning of the year, and it's also because of the higher for longer rates and environment that we're experiencing.\", \"I don't know if what we would like to add something. In terms of details, I don't know. First half against first half, in the United, Spain is up 15%. So if we grew zero in the second half, the year on year would be around 7%. So I don't understand what you get the minus nine.\", 'If I go quarter on quarter, NIA in Spain was started in the third quarter of last year, 174, fourth quarter 174, first quarter of this year 182, second quarter 184, we would expect the 184 to be the peak, and then slightly down in the second half, probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year, and we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025.', \"In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis points headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year end. The guidance of 12% is post-bassery fully loaded. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from City, please go ahead. Thank you very much. I've got a couple of follow ups in the US. You're still struggling to deliver positive jobs.\", 'When you think things will turn around there, do you think that we will see positive jobs in the second half of the year? In the US as well, your PNL still remains pretty supported by tax credits. Can you help us understand how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters? And then if I may ask, do you think the new reporting is helping investors understand something better? Because judging by your low PE, I think not, so I would like to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.', \"Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain a little bit what's going on in the US. If you look at by business, you're going to see that retail is actually having lower cost than it used to have because of the transformation, even with the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really good cost reduction and we believe we're going to perform better. They just are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIV and CIV as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it.\", \"So if we're going to have a second half that is better, it's going to start looking better but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIV business and some of the still people are coming into the team that will start to come in in the next few months, as you know, there's a period of garden leave, et cetera. But the main reason is the investment we're doing in CIV, which by in any way is not creating a bit investment bank or anything like that.\", \"This is basically, as we said, complementing the rest of the business that we have, our size is not going to be huge, it's a size of a really small boutique, but it's helping us out to be full and to help us in the remainder of the business. And you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact. On terms of the P&L, it's quite easy to understand. The DTAs are basically what we said last year when we started doing the electric vehicles.\", \"I mean, we signed contracts with some OEMs that are generating these DTAs and that's why you see that the P&L is affected by that and it's going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing them in that volume. So we have now three things and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the DTAs in the US. All right? And you're going to see that throughout the year. In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing.\", \"The new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are getting managed in the business on a day-to-day basis, okay? Because it's making us work together. It's making us spend a lot less in the past, for example, and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean, we used to have 11 different apps in 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed. Today is being deployed in all of Europe.\", \"The last deployment we did was a UK and they were deploying Brazil and then we were deploying also the US. So what's happens is basically you use the same around 80-20 and that's the goal that we're basically going through, investing just once and those 80% common, 20% common, 20% cost optimization per each country. So that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way.\", \"We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When the acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two. And you saw the results that I explained. I mean, how EBDA is growing and I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And is just one platform, the one that is being deployed.\", \"Now this platform is being deployed down to Chile. It's in deploy to Argentina and we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way.\", \"Then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they're reporting, I mean, you're going to start getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're managing it, we're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So it's very important that you understand that.\", \"Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB where we are being working together for a long time, the same effects factor is that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the UK are completely the same and is the same product and we just make them once. So that basically tells you how we're going to be able, I mean, how we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19% that I gave you.\", \"So this is exactly the points that we're doing and I believe that it will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and do things in a much cheaper way. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. So two questions for me. The first one is on NII in Brazil.\", 'You still maintain the guidance of growth in the high things for the year. Meetings would imply a quarter and quarter form during the second half if you think this could be the case or not. I mean, because select rates have been expectations of cuts have been pushed out. So you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the NII to select rates in Brazil. And the second question is about NII in the US.', 'We have seen its bottoming out in the second quarter, but they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So if you will need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not, in this context, if you can also comment on the plans to launch open bank, what shall we expect there?', \"Because when I look for example at the digital consumer bank, the deposits are growing there by 20%, but net interest margin is still falling despite the shift to retail deposits. So you can comment also on this NII trends here. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, very strong quarter, up more than 3%, and it's up more than 22% in the year.\", \"What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the changing mix, and lower rates. It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year, by year end, and this ultimately means that NII growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay? Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end of 24.\", \"It's a good performance, I should continue in 25. And let me tell you that, to take the opportunity, that Brazil has delivered a 16% growth rate. I believe that the end of the year should end up between 16 and 17. Strong profitability improvement is not just relying on NII growth, but on the good delivery on fees also. The cost-contention that we have had and expected cost of risk stable during the year.\", \"So I remember you, very optimistic in Brazil, and the ability to continue spending the profitability, as you have seen. In the open bank in the US, open bank will come into the US with the deposit gathering facility towards September, October. We expect that to come. The first phase is the deposit gathering, and I believe it would be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place, and then we'll come and we'll be improving the platform as we see fit.\", 'The first of the deposits, the transactional deposits that SBNA has had remained stable during the year. What you have seen in the post-its in the US is basically the deposits that we have in CIV, which are the ones that we decide on profitability, which is better for us or not. Sometimes because of profitability, we basically let them go, and we move out, we see fit. So there is no problem into that, and we will continue to see that working profitability towards every business that we do.', 'One quick comment on this CB Europe margins and profitability. The new business we wrote in 2021 was extremely profitable. This was post-COVID, and we had historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay, this production is going to stay in our books for three years. So still in our books in 2024, it will gradually disappear between 24 and 25.', 'The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at wroteies of around 20%, ROR was of 2.3 to 4%, which is much, much higher than 22 and 23 annual productions. So you should expect in 2025 a very substantial pickup in profitability in margins and in profitability in consumer Europe because of this in and out of the different productions, and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year following COVID. Thank you, can we have the next question please.', 'This question from Albert of Hernández Garais-Thaval from UBS, please go ahead. Hello, good morning and thanks for checking my questions. I have two. First, we assume you are aiming for the upper end of your ROT target for next year, so that is 17%, which implies a meaningful profit increase in 25 versus 24. So my question is geographically, where is that earnings growth going to come from?', \"And second, related to previous questions, we have seen revenues improving in the US over the last couple of quarters, with volumes up, customer spread, expanding and this coming quite strong. So basically, how sustainable is this revenue pickup going forward? Thanks. Okay, thank you, Albert. Let me start with the US. To tell you, I believe I'm in the US, revenue is going to continue to do pretty well.\", \"Both the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality, in terms of what happens to us in provisions. So what you're going to see is revenue continues to go up, quite fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CAB business. But revenues will be doing fine.\", \"In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions, but we believe, and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions, show us that it coming better. The LTM numbers that we have in provisions for the US are much better than last year. So it's looking well. And so the US shall have a much better year than last year. In terms of the revenue and 17, Jose, if you would like to comment.\", 'Yeah, obviously we expect profitability to continue to increase on the part of increased. Sorry. What I was saying is that we expect our profitability to continue to increase on the back of a higher operational leverage. Our transformation program is delivering very positive jobs that we expect to maintain, particularly in consumer in retail in 2025.', 'The sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NIA in South America, both Brazil and Chile. So definitely operational leverage is what we will continue driving increased profitability. In terms of cost of risk, no signs of deterioration and looking into the next few quarters, we see no signs that we will require to increase our provisions going forward.', 'So if you put all of this together, again, this means that our profits should continue to increase going forward. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Benjamin Conds from RBC. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you both for taking my questions. The first one is on Brazil. He used a 350 million gain to top up your provisioning.', \"I think that's an extra few of adopted before, but how come to lie you that you will need not need to do further top ups in Brazilian cost of risk going forward? Another top up is a catch up or can we assume that the top ups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in Brazil in the coming years? And then secondly in the UK, in the deck you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for 2024.\", 'This suggests that either you do not have any maturity this year, or you pre-hege some of your maturity. If you have been pre-heching, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge matureities have you pre-heached? And what rates did you look in at given the swap rates have been volatile? And do you expect the tailwind from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on NII in the UK in 2025? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let me go to Brazil. Okay.', \"First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provisions is exclusively linked to the long growth that we have in the country. Cost of risk as you have seen is flat quarter on quarter, 4.77 and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand that the recent vintage that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So it's performing better than we expected.\", \"It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain you a little bit. For example, credit cards were in 2021. We were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month. Today we're doing just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base.\", \"The important thing and the big change is exactly that we're not going to be directed to the upper market, which was the one that hurt us quite a lot during 2020, 2021, 23. So that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very focused on profitability and we have been very opportunistic and we use the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point.\", \"And we'll rate the rate at the 24 guidance of delivering its afflatic cost of risk versus 23, okay, including the one of us. So that's what I see in terms of Brazil. In terms of the UK, Jose, please. So as you know, obviously the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits to protect the balance sheet ahead of decreasing interest rates.\", 'Following the recent increase in market rates and in order to protect the NII, we have accelerated the plan investments for 2024 amongst other measures. So the sensitivity we have today is to a hundred percent decrease in parallel decrease in rates in the UK. Today is minus 120 million pounds compared to minus 220 million pounds a year ago. So roughly we have half of the sensitivity today that we had a year ago.', 'The current hedge is a structural hedge is 114 billion pounds compared with 106 billion in December. So this is related to my comment before. With the duration of 2.5 years in December, it was 2.5 years in December, it was 2.4 years and the yield is slightly over 2%. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Carlos Pesoto from Galchabán BPI, please go ahead. The first question will actually be a follow-up in Spain, sorry, on this again.', 'The end is to correctly and the message was that in 2025 NII should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year, where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single-digit growth in 2025. And then my second question will actually be on the US EVs tax rebate that you have been booking. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that, or basically for how long is it in place?', \"Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or something at a state level? And to what extent the potential changes in policy changes in the US could drive that to this period or not, just to have an idea on the time frame for which this is valid right now. Thank you. Thank you Carlos. All right, I mean, I think in the Jose gave a pretty good explanation of what's going on in terms of how do we see no?\", \"Things, it's important to understand what Jose explained to you about what we're doing on the HHS, the alcohol position that we have that will help us throughout the year, even if the rates come down. I think we're probably in the best ever position in that sense. And even as we say, I mean, the NII will slightly come down over the second half, and then we'll see that we will have a pretty good ones towards, let's see how rates basically behave.\", \"But I don't know because if you like to complement, but it's basically. It's exactly what I said. Carlos, it's exactly what you said. I expect NII to go down slightly in the second half of the year, the year-on-year growth 24 against 23 will be somewhere between 5 to 7%. And then next year, NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of the year, which means that NII should be down slightly low single digits. Because again, and this is using the forward rate curves today.\", \"So if this was to change, obviously we would need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for NII in Spain next year. And as I told mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, year and a half. Thank you, Carlos. Okay, on the US, let me go through exactly what happens. First of all, let me tell you that is federal.\", \"We don't know if this is going to be sustained, if there is a change of government in the US or not. I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one. Exactly what happens is every single time we do at least on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank. So what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle. And then we get the cash back or the, sorry, the tax credit. And you show the cross credit in one lumped. Okay, during the month in which we do that.\", \"Right, to be exactly how it goes. So you don't see the impact in the revenue, but the impact you see in the taxes. So that's exactly how it works. I don't know if I'm being correct. I mean, if I'm being clear in one, the way I'm explaining to you this. But it's exactly how it works. So what we have done is that we have a program. What we have signed with the OEMs that we're doing this for. It depends on the also the capacity that we have to absorb those DTAs.\", \"Because this is not, I mean, unlimited. This is not, I mean, we have to have the depends on the balance sheet that we have. We have calculated the numbers exactly that we can absorb. And this is exactly what we negotiate with the OEMs. I know if you understood the question in the right way, but this is exactly how it works. Okay, and we don't know if it's going to happen in the future or not. Hopefully, it continues to be like that. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\", 'Next question from Miruna Kiraya from Jeffrey. Please go ahead. Good morning, doctor. Morning, Jose. Thank you for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow-up please on points we touched on before. Firstly, in the UK, your NIA was slightly out, quarter, quarter in Q2. So just wondering how you see this progressing from here. And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point on NIA?', 'And it should start building from here supported by the H. What is the shape of this into H2 and also into next year? Secondly, just a clarification on your US business. We were talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality? And then lastly, for Brazil, also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business.', \"When do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So as I said in the UK, we see that we're going to have a second half better than the first half. Okay? Market is more rational, both in the margins and in the betas. And on top of that cost, as I said, is going to be slightly better than the first half of the year. Q2 and NIA is showing inside of improvement. Okay?\", \"And as I basically explained, and we see that betas are not going to go up so that basically will help us. In terms of revenue, we see mid to single digit decrease in NIA down mid single digits versus last year. And fees down low double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and the Harry Cashback. You're going to see that is going to be much better in 25 because exactly we're preparing the bank towards that.\", \"Also, we're very focused on profitability. It's very important that you understand that. Okay? We're not using capital below our cost of equity. So we're being very tough on that. That's a society-wide advantage that. And then Jose, I would like to. Sorry, one question. We comment. The mortgage dynamics in the UK seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year. Just as a additional comment. Brazil cost of risk.\", 'We still believe that cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter on quarter, it was a substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at year on year X, the fourth quarter. And we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024. We would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk.', 'So year on year because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter. And then provisions in the US are normalizing cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or slightly below 2%. Thank you. Can we have the last question, please? Last question from Alberto Negro from Medio Banca. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking my question. So I have just a few follow-ups.', 'The first one is on the UK. If you can give us more color on the contribution of the UK structure or edge in the second half of this year and in next year. And the second one is again on Brazil following your comment on the change of the loan mix. Should we expect a normalization of the cost of risk in the next year and see an absolute decline of total provision next year? Thank you.', \"In terms of Brazil, we're changing the loan mix but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the beatages are behaving. So if we see that Brazil basically and we're starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts, its inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down.\", \"We might change the mix again and we might be a little bit more aggressive and I couldn't tell you up at this point what are we going to do because we revised the strategy every single month of what we do and also the pricing. So I don't know what the mix is going to be in Brazil in 25 but I must tell you that we're working in a very dynamic way. We're in a very dynamic market and you need to be on top of it.\", \"So I couldn't tell you at this point but I mean everything basically is and we change the mix to sustain the cost of risk at the reasonable levels and that's the intent that we have in order to manage that. So UK and I think I gave you all the details to calculate that. I gave you the maturity, the rates, the amount and everything else. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, rates this year are expected to stay at 10.5% by year end but to drop significantly next year and that should help.\", 'In addition to the structure of the balance sheet, lower rates next year in Brazil will help not only in terms of NII but also cost of risk. It will be a gradual improvement. We need to see exactly how we will build the business in 2025 in Brazil but definitely lower rates should help. Thank you, Jose. Thank you, actor. And thank you all for your attendance. And if there are any further questions and then that embasser relations team is always at your disposal for anything that you may need.'], [\"I'm going to start with the presentation. Plean everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings presentation.

We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients.', 'That leverages our strengths and global footprint to go profit while maintaining the same low risk profile. Number one, we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S. Building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across the group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 41% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue across the group as we continue to progress on our U.S. build-out initiative.', 'We continue to execute our global markets plan which is starting to pay off with the institutional sales doubling in Europe and more than tripling in the U.S. Number two, we are expanding and sophisticated our centers of expertise. We are strengthening our financial sponsor franchise which is leading to business opportunities in M&A, capital markets and GTP across the group and continues to pay off with several first deals.', 'This quarter, for example, for the first time, we were appointed Solbook Runner for an IP of SPAC and we acted as the lead left on the writer in an LBO transaction with one of the largest industrial-focused investment firms. And these are just a few examples of a long list. Third, we are driving cross-border revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration.', 'We had a great number of cross-border deals in Q3, such as also resulting from the collaboration of our teams in Mexico and Spain, France and Brazil, Peruan Mexico or Italian France among others. CAB reached solid results with revenue up 9% after record 23, making the first nine months the best ever for its growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows.', 'And the best is still to come, growth is accelerating going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis. Moving on to wealth, we continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and why solutions, resulting in double digit growth in private banking customer and fees.', \"We are shifting our product offering towards value-added solutions, such as discretionary portfolio management, advisory and alternative investments. And this is also supported, Spain's double digit increase in the number of private banking customers and a 22% total revenue growth. Number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses, especially with retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allows to capture network benefits.\", 'Collaboration fees increased by 13% year-end year. Number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth.', 'Good examples of these are the recent implementation of a single operating platform from alternative products and the deployment of SANG connector in Mexico and Brazil, which boosts the distribution network capabilities and provides real-time information about funds and markets. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose 15% on the back of a strong activity and fees growing at double digit across the three businesses.', 'Finally, efficiency improved 210 basis points year-on-year and rotate rose 400 basis points to 81%. Finally, payments. As I already advanced last quarter, we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant-acquiring. In merchant, we are one of the largest accords in Latin America, Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability.', 'Internet total payments volume and Pagan X open market revenue keeps growing strongly, which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market such as Brazil and Mexico for we maintain a leadership position. And at the same time, we build up market sharing fast growing market such as Chile, where we recently launch GEDNET.', 'Our payments have already processes all type of payments, for example, create transfers, direct debits or instant payments and international payments for several countries and businesses. We have already migrated 800 million transactions this year. This is five times more than the same period last year. Also we continue to deploy plard, our global cards platform.', \"In Brazil, we currently manage more than 8 million debit cards through plard and we are on track to full migration by Q225 to manage around 17 million total cards. In a second phase, we will start with a credit card portfolio. At the same time, we continue to boost our card's proposition through our risk data lab, our solution based on AI.\", 'Payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses, cost under control and sound credit quality in cards, which drove to a 10% profit growth, excluding the non-recording items with its cost in Q2. Pagnox, EVDA, margin improved to 23% backed by GEDNET with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and capital optimization to continue to do our profitability in the coming quarters.', 'Our capital ratio has improved this year from 12.3% to 12.5% backed by a strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation, which in terms of TNA, PLOT, DPS increased 14%, which represents around 10 billion year-on-year. And we are increasing our shareholder remuneration.', \"In September, the world's reactors approve an interim distribution against H-124 results, which is being executed in two equal parts, a cash dividend of 10 cents per share, which will be paid from 1 November and a share-by-backed program of 1.5 billion that is currently on the way. The cash dividend will be 39% higher in 24. And at the same time, since 21, if we include a full amount of the current share-by-backed program, Santa and the recovery purchase will be 12.5% of its outstanding shares.\", 'I leave you now with Jose, who will go in our financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Ector. Let me go into more detail the P&L and the capital. As Ector has mentioned, we are yet again reporting record results. As our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on the back of the highest NII and FIS in our history, and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net operating income with rose 13% year-on-year.', 'Revenue provisions grew only slightly, even after the expected normalization in consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland, we recorded in the second quarter, while cost of risk fell in the quarter. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward training profit, which grew 1% quarter and quarter in euros, 5% in cost in euros, driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions.', 'This quarter there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter and quarter in comparison, but as you can see in the P&L, the impact year and year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter we decided to take a more conservative approach to valuing, to recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina.', 'So we began to apply an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was 1,618 compared to the official exchange rate of 1,069 to the euro. And obviously this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach cost some distortions in the quarter and quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only were relevant.', 'Central revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing, driven by customer revenue growth, which made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which continues to grow close to double digits, with good performance in NIA and fees, especially in the Americas, and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels mainly in global banking and markets.', 'Customer revenue also rose, supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and double digit growth in fees across our geographies. We also delivered double digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, both in private banking and in asset management.', 'Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying performance, as both Pagan-Extra and Cards increased, even more so if we exclude the one-time positive fee recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the corporate center revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from FX Hedgin.', 'Turning to NIA and Net Interest margin, most revenue came from Net Interest income, which increased 9% year-on-year, supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management, particularly in retail in Europe and in consumer, and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South America, in retail South America, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile, and also good activity levels in our global banking business in CIB.', 'NIA was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly driven by retail, where it was up 2%, with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quota, especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes, Poland, due to better spreads and high volumes and the UK supported by good price management. In terms of profitability, we improved our Net Interest margin year-on-year.', 'This is explained by higher yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spread, focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than outweighed higher funding costs. We were able to contain thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive reprise in downwards in South America. As we commented last quarter, we have seen a slight desaleration in Net Interest margin and Net Interest income in line with our expectations.', 'Please remember that the decreasing Net Interest margin in the second quarter was due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, Net Interest margin, was also affected by the hyperinflation accounting in Argentina under the appreciation of the real and the Mexican peso, and to a lesser extent, the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe.', 'Of the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for this new monetary policy. Cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in a good condition, in a good position, to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North America going forward.', 'In an environment of low credit and mounting, we generated another record in FIINCAN, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customers service. Retail increased, as more customers chose and under as the primary financial service provider. We added 5 million new customers of the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers.', 'Outstanding performance in consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe, CIB also grew from record levels last year, especially in the US, on the bank of strong dynamics in global banking. We had a 16% increase in wealth, with all three businesses growing at double digits, and payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the one time positive fee record in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil.', 'Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains. Our cost to income ratio for the 9 month period improved to 41.7%. The best level that we have reported in the last 15 years, one of the best in the sector, and is already at better levels, than the guidance we provided for 2024.', 'Cost declined 1% year-on-year in real terms, despite the lack of effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. My business cost remained very well under control in retail and consumer, which represent 70% of our cost-base. More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as part of strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise.', 'Cost remained containing wealth, even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments, even as we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which helped us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further next year. Credit quality remains robust, around and across our footprint in line with our expectations.', 'We record low unemployment rates in most countries and is in monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected both in the MPL ratio and lower coverage needs. MPL portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%. In our retail and consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quota. In retail, there were sound underlying trends across the different countries.', 'Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the UK and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row and in Mexico, it also declined in the quota following a year of expected normalization. Similarly, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quota to 2.12%.', 'The cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end a year comfortably within our target of 1.2%. Final iteration into capital is a full-loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level back by strong organic capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization.', 'This quota we generated 43 basis points organically, on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation, partially offset by risk weighted asset growth and by minorities. We recorded a 26 basis point charge for Shea Hall remuneration in line with our 50% payout policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios.', 'And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of some dandered Poland and alcohol portfolio valuations, which were offset by impacts on the actions, pensions in the most part, for the most part. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity.', 'Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk weighted assets of 2.9% in the quota, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralize asset management desk, which aims to optimize capital deployment, is achieving outstanding results.', \"In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to 40 billion in risk weighted assets at the cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet that materials every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio. That's all from my side. Ektor back to you. Thank you. Thank you, Jose.\", 'It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for 25 in our last investor day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams. Some city one levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans further improving our profitability to above 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders.', 'In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the back of strong custom revenue with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine months profit ever with all tam high NII, fees and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth.', \"Sustain progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15 years. A rock solid balance sheet and robust quality are contributing to growth and double-deed shareholders value creation.\", 'As a result, we remain on track to exceed the 24 targets we set in January and upgraded last quarter and we are in a great position to continue growing increasing profitability and delivering shareholders value creation.', \"The progress of the last 10 years to simplify an aligned our model in all our businesses and now deployed our own tech stack is already evident and as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on primary target of double digit TNA pressure plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we are very happy to take your questions. Thanks. So thank you, actor. Operator, please let's begin the Q&A session. Please. Thank you.\", \"If you wish to ask a question, please press the star 5 on your telephone. We'll be right half the first question from the 5. Ljolargi from BNP Pariba, please go ahead. Thanks very much. We want everyone and thanks very much for the presentation and for taking the questions I have to if I may. The first one is on NII just to get a bit of a better understanding of the moving parts of the NII during the quarter and also also we expect about the group top line group NII incoming quarters.\", \"The second one would be on course outlook and given the solid performance that we have seen in the quarter, how should we think about course performance going forward and as per horse's comments in the presentation, what kind of improvements do we expect in terms of course to income for 2025. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Let me give it a first key and then I'll host a basically good base, give you another idea. It's interesting to see that if you see NII in constant, you see that is 1% up.\", 'The effect of Argentina is the one that hitting us in the current dures. It is important to explain first of all that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business. This is about 60% of the group balance sheet with some parts showing a really positive sensitivity in Europe and others a negative one like the one we have in Brazil as you already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80 to 90% of the rate exposure.', \"Over the past few quarters we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower rates environments. For example, in the case of Europe we have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In places like Brazil for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the alcohol and also taking some hedges.\", \"You have already seen this year the retail business is operating leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line not just because of high interest rates but also because we're changing the operating model which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate. We're growing customers for example 2.6 million in the third quarter alone and we're keeping cost flat which is quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins.\", \"This is basically a thing that we will continue improving thanks to all first of all the geographical and business identification, the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know how you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost. Yes, definitely thanks. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail.\", 'In June we used an exchange rate of 1499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating and depreciating the exchange rate with inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate as of now is 1069. For the quarter, for the end of the quarter we used 1618 and remember that when you use 1618 inflation accounting you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate. So we have two impacts on our PNL1.', 'There is over 100 million negative quarter and quarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income and in Argentina since it has come down and we have a very liquid balance sheet and is invested mostly in bonds. The yield earn on this bond portfolio is lower and quarter and quarter is over 200 million drop in local currency. You look at local currency there is over 200 million drop in the yield coming from these investments.', 'So Argentina actually explains most of the drop in an interest income, quarter and quarter but also it means around 300 over 300 million impact on total revenue. So as Ektorex explained we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates both in euros and in Brazil which obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe we have been buying and increasing the alcohol portfolio.', 'If we look at the total euro alcohol portfolio we have which is Spain, Portugal and the consumer finance. We have 50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over 6 years and a yield of 3.2, 3.3%. The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities and we also hedge the reprise in our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward starts.', 'So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates. In Brazil we did the opposite. In Brazil we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets.', 'Net net when we look into 2025 for 2024 we see NII down a little bit in current euros but we see NII up in constant euros thanks to these measures that we have discussed and these estimates are based on forward curve rates. Forward rate curves. Thank you Jose. Ignacio in terms of cost is very important that you understand the following. This is not about a cost-coding exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model we are basically introducing in the whole group.', 'It is talking about, I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalogue of products that we have in the group. We have diminished them by almost a third. From 10,000 products we are down to less than 7500 for example. We are changing completely the model we are doing in strong simplification. We are doing a lot of automation but most importantly by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day.', 'So one transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that cost grew less than half of the revenue growth where the living positive jobs are helping to reduce the efficiency to 41.7 which is 2128 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target being at 42 in 24. So we are going to be much better and we believe that we are going to continue that. The new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost.', 'Our ambition is not to lower cost exactly to lower cost in absolute euro-million terms which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate. It is true that costs are up 2.5% but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms costs are down minus 1%. A year or a year.', \"That's a remarkable performance out to the operating leverage with the strong declines that I describe in retail reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment and consumer payments while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow. So the higher cost as Hoss explained reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects.\", \"It's Alia Agreements, Buenos Aires and CIB is the bulk because we are investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and it's actually getting there. So in 2004 efficiency ratio is around 42%, where acknowledged this ratio is already at the level we committed for the 25 ID target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain cost flat but grow the revenue faster.\", \"So our ambition is therefore to do better than initially planned next year in 25 in the cost to income as we describe. So I don't know if that basically answers your questions. Thank you. We can take the next question please. The next question,<|ca|> for the presentation on the key questions. First one is on motor finance business in the UK.\", 'I know that you need time to analyze the recent ruling but I wonder if you can give an indication of how big the provision in needs whether we are talking about hundreds, billions or and also the impact on the business. And my second question is on capital if you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next on the past three impact of fact to 50 basic points on a fully loaded basis other ones have reduced the impact of the recent regulatory updates.', \"So you can also comment on this. Thank you. Thank you Francisco. Okay. First of all let me tell you that I mean as you correctly said is not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling, other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts. This set in any event the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial position. Okay. It's very important. Nor will affect the achievement of the group financial targets for 24.\", \"So if you make the numbers and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16% that basically tells you where do we believe the number is. Okay. So it's very important and I will reiterate that again that you will not change our 24 guidance so that basically gives you a bold park idea or what do we believe the number should be. I don't know Jose, I left something out or I think it's quite clear. Yeah, I think that's perfect. And in terms of why don't you go to the capital thing is.\", \"Yeah, remember that we estimated a supervisory charges to be between 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. We had 18 in the third quarter we still believe that it's going to be you know this 20 to 30 basis points. So this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year and remember since the beginning of the year has been between 1240 to 1250. We add at 1250 in the upper end of the range and we think we could we will close the year more or less at this level.\", \"For next year day one, bus and three impact basically close to zero is like a different slidey positive but it's not going to change much. So day one capital ratio for some time there under bus and three will be more or less the same the same with which we will end 2024 and the fully loaded and when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges.\", \"So fully fully loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points which means that we will be on day one above the 12% that we set as our target, fully loaded capital above 12% on day one fully loaded. Thank you. Thank you, Paco. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Can you hear me? Yeah, I'm sorry. I just had to follow up questions really one on Campbell generation.\", \"So you've given basically a very limited impact the next 10 years which you're already 12 and a half and with the mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate, you're going to generate capital above the 12 and a half you're currently sitting on.\", \"So the question is, as we think about 2526, are you willing to operate in a range of 12 or 13, let's say, or do you expect to grow into that 12 and a half or would you consider sort of increasing any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation. And I apologize to follow up on this and the UK, that's the only explanation in my view why the share price might be down this morning.\", \"You've been quoted Jose saying that's less than 600 million and I understand it's not an impact for 2024 but it might be an impact beyond that. So any details you can give us on the book, if it's new cars, the size of the book or any details that make you confident that we're looking at a relatively manageable number, that would be great. Thank you. Thank you, Alberto. Let me explain you a little bit what is very important.\", \"As you know, Jose explained you exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet. You've got to understand that we're changing completely the model of the bank in the way we used to. The bank used to consume a huge amount of RWA's to generate profits. We're changing the model in a way and the most important thing of that, changing the model is becoming the number one bank to our clients.\", \"But becoming that, basically you generate quite a lot of revenue by something different that just used RWO to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having. You're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right? So if we continue changing this model, just less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital we're doing today, all right?\", \"We feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at this level of capital, but I do believe that we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets, we also have now with the asset desk in place, tremendous capacity to move those assets out of the books, all right? So, and by the way, if you saw what Jose said, we are doing so and making money on top of it. Also, we're servicing, we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell.\", \"So it's a double one in that sense. So the model of the bank is changing in that sense and it's becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital. So yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on an organic way in the future. On the UK, Jose, I don't know if you want to also complement something in capital? No, I think capital you answered perfectly. Alvaro, the issue is complex.\", 'I think just let me remind you of some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months. We need to clarify the perimeter of commissions. We need to clarify the ventages because the ruling talks up between 2025 and 2024, the FCA focuses between 2014 to 2021, the percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest, so there are many moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May, so there are many moving parts.', 'We are analyzing this and obviously we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation.', \"However, we are very confident that as Ektorexplained, the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group and we will still meet our objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16 or slightly above 16%. And that's what we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically speculation.\", \"So obviously we will make a decision based on the actual ruling, based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court guidance on this and in any case, obviously the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision. Thank you, Alvaro. Next question please. The next question, can you turn from the line of Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, Ektan. I'm from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please.\", 'The first one is on the outlook for long growth in Brazil. If I look alone or flat, quarter, quarter in local currency, which is perhaps not particularly encouraging for the NII outlook in the context of rate tax in the region, can you talk about your expectations for long growth here and what this means for NII in Brazil? And maybe I could also please remind us what the time lag is with respect to reprising between assets and liabilities in Brazil.', \"I understand your liability reprise is much faster than assets if you could remind us how many months in lag that is. And my second question is with respect to the US profitability. I mean, this is a part of your business that's negatively correlated to rates. I've been adding at least a number of investment or corporate bankers in the region, which is showing good momentum in fees.\", \"Could you maybe just talk us through the key PNA line items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward, please. Thank you. Thank you, Antonio. Let me go a little bit through the Brazil situation, okay? To tell you a little bit what's going on. It's very important that you understand the following. In Brazil, also, we're changing a little bit the model that we have today. As we know, we used to use very hardly RWAs. We just to basically give out a lot of loans.\", \"Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We're basically focused on profitability, okay? Last term focus on profitability, which is basically changing a little bit the mix. Also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage and we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal.\", \"So we're being very choosing the way we manage that and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we are very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that give the deposit and have their deposits with us. Also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that that basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil, okay? NII, if you see it, it's a good quarter.\", \"It's up more than 3% in the quarter. It's more than 22% in year-on-year. What's behind the performance, as I told you? Healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the local rates because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. If you remember in my presentation, I talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients.\", 'It is true that the rate outlook has changed, but now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected. And we thought at the beginning of the year, but nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian NII to grow around the meetings marked by the end of 24 and we will have further growth in 25. And if we continue with our strategy and getting clients and getting more deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off.', \"Okay, and let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% rate. This is strong profitability improvement. It's not just rely on tonnania growth, but also it's very important, the good delivery on fees because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So selling other products, insurance, some more things that are basically helping us out.\", \"Also it's very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also an stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that, and I don't believe, I really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue spending its profitability through 25. Okay, I don't know, Jose, if you would like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities. Yeah, so liabilities in Brazil basically reprise automatically with the Interbank rates.\", \"So almost 100% of the liabilities are linked to the Interbank rates. 60% of the assets mature in 12 months. So that gives you a sensitivity of the negative sensitivity. We have to rate in Brazil. Thank you. Let me go into the US, Antonio. So it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-fledged commercial banking in the US. We are focused on the businesses. We are focused. Okay. We are focused mainly in our consumer business.\", \"The consumer business, as you say, has negative sensitivity to rates. That's exactly why we launched Open Bank there. And we're also using SBNA, our commercial bank, to fund that. All right. We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have, and as you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICO's really on the prime and near prime level. Okay. And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep-supreme and so prime.\", \"So that basically makes combination and is going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there. In terms of consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are at that scale player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with OEMs, and we were able to capture very good agreements with INIOS, Lotus, Tesla and Mitsubishi.\", \"It's very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the PNL, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of these is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And the electrical vehicles were buying them because it's mostly leasing. So that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you see it on the payback. We have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles.\", \"So that basically changes a little bit the outlook, but all in all, I really see that the US will continue to thrive over the next year or so. Okay? Also in the commercial side, the business is doing well. We have a Dixit Pertis. We also, you know that we have this JV with the FDIC, with it has been tremendously successful, and I think we'll continue so. I had a solid performance and then you talk about the CIV advisory services.\", \"CIV just grew 41% year and year in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also you don't see how the US is helping the rest of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees in CIV in Europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the US teams to help us out, getting some of new business that we didn't use to get.\", \"Also in Latin America, if you take a look at for example, not just cross border in Manay, but if you take a look at what we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in that market just because of the expertise we've brought into the table. So when the Mexican UMS did a 7 billion transaction, the beginning of the year were one of the four banks and we were the only non-American bank in the game.\", \"So those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have the local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing onto the table. And wealth also we have a leading brand in Latin America, that business is basically working as a Swiss clock. So I really do believe that the US will continue to thrive, very good outlook for 25 and really good numbers coming up in terms of the PNL we see there. Thank you Antonio. The next question please.\", 'The next question comes from the line of Martha San Centromero from C.P. please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on the slide. And you have to really mark the line from the process for the past year. You have really good relationship changes on the top of the five sessions. Do you foresee a change of strategy? How do you go on how more serious capital, but how do you see the line and the project going forward?', \"My second question comes on the US deposit for the cost and the volumes of flat in the quarter. It's just on the launch of the month in the country. On your website you send your pay 11 times that that's your average for the post. How much do you accept the terms of volume to gain from your open-bound franchise and where do you see the cost of volume? I'm just thinking and I'm not talking about the real technical growth process for 2020 points. I understand other changes on the CDTAC strategy.\", \"Thank you. We couldn't hear you the first question at all. So could you repeat that one? Sorry about that. And the second question was about the US, but we lost part of it. So a quick answer to that. So, sorry, it's just like the sorry for that. So on the same, you've been using market chain loans on the deposit over the past year. You have made management changes at the top. So do you expect a change of strategy, more risk appetite?\", \"Where do you see loans and the post it's going forward in Spain? Secondly, in the US. So you've launched open bank so far your volumes and cost of the deposits are flat in the quarter. How much deposits do you expect to bring to the platform and what do you see the cost going forward? And sorry, the effective tax rate in the US. Thank you. Sorry for the. Thank you, Martha. Let me go ahead.\", \"In terms of the money changes we have done to Spain, basically they're not going to change the plans that we had before. We're going to basically very much focus on profitability, that's number one. We're also changing the model. Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on one transformation. Okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification, automation in what we have there.\", \"If you compare one of our branches, for example, in portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in a branch in portugal is basically taking care of clients. 50% of what we do in Spain is taking care of incidents, problems, different situations, etc. So it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation, an automation that we need to do on the back in Spain. So we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient and with a much better cost structure.\", \"Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms in Spain is one of the places that we're going to be concentrating the most in the near term. So it's quite important to understand that we will continue doing that. And we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit bets that we have done. So very much concentrated on that. Getting new clients is very important to acknowledge that for the seven consecutive months we have grown on clients in Spain in a mature market.\", \"That basically tells you that the model is working, that exactly where the living on what we believe is a right thing to do. So we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming Spain in what we need to do, but also with the global platforms we're going to be able to be much more competitive, more efficient and better for our clients.\", 'Also, this structure of being the number one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically will allow us to sell the more products. One product that is very important and we are punching below our weight is insurance, for example, in which some competitors are much more vigor than us in that sense. So there is a huge opportunity of we can do that.', \"Also, if you take a look on CIB, CIB with a hatch of really interesting and important deliver, given that we're using our US teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So that is helping us out quite a lot and we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So Spain will continue as we say in terms of the tax rate in the US. Yes, please. No, no, I wanted to talk a little bit. Josetta, I believe that 24 in all in all, we're going to be a strong year for Spain.\", \"We remain optimistic, OK, NII. We see growing in high single digit together with customer growth as I told you and higher transactionality. And we'll drive our revenue up about double digit. The efficiency ratio will continue improving and we see the cost of risk below 50 basis points by year end. OK, and also strong improvements in Rote to a level well above 20%. So Josetta, if you'd like to come into the US.\", \"Just quickly, Marta, this year the tax rate is going to be more or less close to zero. Actually, we're going to actually have a slight credit from the sale of EVs. And from here, it should gradually normalize as we do less EVs and more contribution from other businesses. So we could think of like around 10% next year, maybe 15% next year. So gradually normalizing at that pace, at more or less 10 next year, 15 the following year. Yeah. OK, thanks. Next question, please.\", 'The next question, can someone the line of carus special to from cash bank with the I please go ahead? Yes, hi, good morning. A couple of questions from my side as well. Firstly, on the U.K. NIA outlook, we saw good recovery in the in the third queue. We actually saw improvements in low yields and also lower deposit costs. I was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the into the fourth queue in into 2025.', 'Should we expect margin expansion to prevail or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spread to stabilize more or less around these levels? Is basically how do you see the outlook for NIA in the U.K.? Then if I may pick up a bit on the on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before, you mentioned that you lower than an I. In Spain, 25% of what it was prior to to to to to to to to to to to to to change the rate cycle.', \"I was just wondering if you could update this on exactly where where the sensitivity lies now, particularly for for Spain, but also for some of the larger geographies that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you, Carlos. Okay. On the U.K. I would like to tell you. I mean, I think it's one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of one transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying that's something that we are very concentrated on.\", \"Also, the automation what we're doing there, we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have. We started the year with 20,000 people. We're going to end up with 18,000. So simplification and automation is well underway. And then as I said on the presentation, it's quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms. One up came into the U.K. just about. We did the big bang and change all our clients there.\", \"And it's becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients, helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of NPS. Okay, it is important to say that we believe that we have much better market economics dynamics. Okay, lending activity. We see it picking up. We are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well. We see more rational behavior of the U.K. banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus better pricing of the deposits.\", \"We are actively managing deposits as I told you know. First of all, with the new clients coming in, with the new H account that we launched, that's being helping us. So we rate the data bill that NIA will improve in the H2 versus H1. Okay, as you have said, we're going to finish 24 with NIA down only mid single digit instead of the minus 9% that we have reported in the first nine months.\", 'We respect further rate cost in the remaining of 24, but the outlook of 25 that is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far. Carlos, in terms of interest sensitivity. So let me comment for the main countries. For the group as a whole first. In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NIA to increase next year. You know, maybe two, three percent. In Spain, using using a two and a half percent interest rate in Europe in for the mid of next year of 2025.', \"We would expect a slight decrease in NIA in Spain. In the UK, a sector just commented a slight increase in NIA. In the US, we would expect high single digit increase in Mexico, mid to high single digit increase in Brazil. It's quite important. The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of NIA. We expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11, 11.5%.\", 'With these level of interest rates, NIA in Brazil should be up mid single digits. And basically, and finally, in this city also high single digit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about. As I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for instance, in this city, as inter-race were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly significantly lower. Thank you Carlos.', 'Next question please. The next question comes from the line of Andrea Filetri from Medibanca. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. First of all, a question of extrapolation. Contensus is forecasting no growth of profit in 2025 versus 2024. You are currently growing profits at 14% year or near in the nine months. And I mean, usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your view?', \"And the second is a follow up on the capital elaboration of them before. I'm looking at slide 23 without regulatory headwinds. If you have built 35 business points of capital in one quarter after distribution, can you confirm with Q4 we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds and is the higher profitability than yielding to higher capital build up versus the 10 business points per quarter guidance that you have given us.\", \"Final thing is a clarification on battle four before you said that on day one. City one should be flatish. If I remember correctly, there were 20 business points of impacts this year. The should have reversed with was for adoption. Can you clarify that? Thank you. Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little of what we believe. First of all, I will most tell you that I have great confidence that we'll deliver.\", \"And in some metrics like cost to income over the liver on the financial targets that we set on the best or day for the period of 23 to 25. Okay. 25 will be better than 24 for 25 respect to continue to our revenues, especially fees as I explained with a new model deployment that we're doing. We're going to further improve the operating leverage and we're going to deliver higher profitability. And we will do this how by leveraging further the global and network businesses. Okay.\", \"We're putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect. We're doing more with less. First of all, leveraging also our products and global factories. Like for example, from our corporate bank into our commercial banks, what we're doing between CIV and the commercial business on the midsize companies and SMEs. Also one transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail.\", \"We're talking about minus 4% on year to year cost, proactive customer and 6% year on year revenue, proactive customer. So since the start of the program, the number of products as I said before is down almost 36% okay. 60% of the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program right in summary the strategy and business model diversification discipline approach to capital allocation.\", \"We believe the lever a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come. So all in all, yes. Jose, I don't know if you'd like to comment into the capital. Let me get you all the components of the capital ratio and I think you can make your own conclusions here. So on page 23 we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation, post 81s cost of hedges, etc.\", \"Which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk wetter as a growth, which is 8 billion growth partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points of 5 billion. Remember that so far this year we've mobilized 35 to 40 billion in terms of risk wetter assets. And on markets and others we have 7 basis points from the sale of Poland. So with this I think you can conclude more or less the recurring capital generation we will be able to have going forward.\", \"Obviously the net risk wetter as a growth, gross risk wetter assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component. Obviously that excess capital is being or that capital is being reinvested at 2.9% return on risk wetter assets, but obviously it's capital that is being reinvested.\", \"So in the first quarter of the year we will have the first quarter of the year and this will compensate the other negative impacts, the one impacts that we have mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios, corporate portfolios, etc. And it's obviously zero is the net of some positives and some negatives and amongst the positives is these 20 basis points from the maturity we use in derivative transactions. You are right. Andrea thank you. Next question please.\", \"The next question comes from the line of Ignacio Ferezo from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Sorry I'm going to come back to capital in particular. If you can give us actually the path of those 40 basis points you have on the full load of basis actually how those scatter review on actually within the next years, specifically how much of that is going to fall on 2025.\", \"Sorry if you have referred to this actually I just want clarification and then related to this going back basically to what I was asking before. What is the preferred use of any potential access capital that you're building that you're thinking basically accelerating growth, spending a little bit of that or is it is a question basically also considered the possibility of increasing distributions.\", 'And then the final on the capital actually if I may what kind of budget for SRT is actually you have random in the next two to three years building up into your capital for cost. Thank you. Okay so the 40 basis points as you remember we are not affected by the output floor because we use lots of standard models so that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models.', \"We are not affected by that that is back loaded that's what comes later from 2029 to 2033 if I'm not mistaken we are mostly affected the 40 basis points is mostly the result of operational risk that will come over the next four or five years if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the facing in our case.\", \"I think Victor already answered the question about the access capital and budget on a recurring basis obviously the demand for private credit today is enormous is I'm not going to say it's infinite but it's huge. So obviously I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interrates come down obviously but we think that on a recurring basis we should be able to mobilize somewhere between 35 to 55 billion in res weighted assets.\", \"Both obviously as artists will only be maybe a third of that 15 billion a year it's reasonable to assume that you know 10 to 15 will come from as artists and the other will be from all the types of of hedges and another type of transactions assets sales etc. Like we did this year but on a recurring basis with a more normalized market 35 billion 40 billion per year is like a reasonable number. Thank you Ignacio next question please.\", \"The next question comes from the live on Sophie Peterson from the Epimorgan please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. This is the thief from JPMorgan. Sorry to just go back to the organic capital generation but on the on a legal that you hosted a few weeks ago you said or even said that you don't get net zero. We created assets growth and a wrong 50 basis points organic capital generation per quarter is that reasonable to assume going forward on.\", \"Yes that would basically be my first question. And then the second question is that at M&E is the quiet hot topic in Europe at this point in time if you're going to generate more gas down going forward. How do you think about in organic growth opportunities? What would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of products or region? And yeah if you could talk about your thinking in road M&E and then the last question would be around Brazil as a quality.\", \"I noticed that the MPL ratio picked up 0.3 percent quarter and quarter and also coverage came down quite a lot in Brazil. How should we think about this? Thank you. Thank you Sophie. Yes I mean the answer is in organic capital generation just you write I mean that's about it. In terms of the organic opportunities I do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the group.\", 'I think that the chances and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming investing class versus the best in class in every single market that we operate that basically tells you the huge opportunity that we have in front of us. And we will continue like that we will concentrate on our changes on the go to model of the bank. I mean this process that is going to take us at least the next 24 months in order to have also the global platform set in place etc.', \"So we're very much concentrated on that. And that's exactly what all the focus of the group is today. In terms of the Brazil as a quality as you have seen I mean as you have seen basically first of all I must tell you that we have very strong revenue performance OK solid the pollution on cost OK flat quarter and quarter. But we have a really resilient behavior of the great quality cost of risk is stable at 4.78 and the more recent vintage just performing well.\", \"We don't have any signs of deterioration is very important that you acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the world we're looking at the Brazilian portfolio OK so as I was telling you before we just to grow in every single segment of the market today we're not doing so we're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have.\", \"So you're going to see a much better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so alright so it's quite important that you see that and you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have to for the towards the end of 24 is an stable cost of risk versus 23 around 4.6 and as I said I mean with the new changes that we're putting in place etc. I think the vintage will perform much better than we expected OK. OK thanks Sophie the next question please.\", \"The next question comes from the line of British me from autonomous please go ahead. Yeah I think you're for taking my questions a few clarifications when you talk about things close I'm just a bit to current yours as well. I'm just asking you as you go to to 3% and I was next year in constant yours and it might be a little bit lower in current yours and that I would think would have to drive most of the revenues to deliver positive jobs.\", \"And then a clarification on the rates you mentioned 2.5% for your business that we would expect for the full year than as well or the average expectation for the year. And then lastly on on Portugal and an interesting comedy client significantly this year as we saw a big deposit cost increase. It's just a catch up whether see the competition and where do you expect to deposit cost to go in the future. Thank you.\", 'So yes we would expect income next year to grow mid single digits with cost fairly floodish so yes we would expect revenue operating income to actually increase next year. In terms of interest rates well we think 2.5% is the rate that we expect by mid year and then maybe one drop one cut more in the second half of the year.', 'So we do not see 2% as the terminal rate in Europe right now obviously you know we will see but in our case we are not as negative as the market or positive depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates. And then because of the post is pretty you refer to countries like which country Spain in particular.', \"Sorry I didn't get whose which country you were referring to so we will we will get back to you after the call Carlos will will give you call and clarify that but let me let me just very quickly in Spain. Obviously the beat us that we ended up this year having this year where much much lower than the ones that we expected so we we manage our cost of the post is pretty well basically thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time the profits.\", 'As rates come down those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Uriber basically private banking corporate banking and and and and the large corporations is suggesting that was as well so going forward we should see actually a positive contribution from year on year the positive cost in Spain from 24 to 20 from 24 to 25.', 'Other euro countries in Portugal the situation is a little bit more extreme so in in Portugal we would expect an eye to actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year because there obviously the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in Spain. Thanks Rita next question please. Thanks on the line of Chris Halem from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', \"I just have just one question left and thank you for the color on on 2025 and I rate sensitivity so it's a bit of a follow up question but is the sensitivity to lower euro rates linear as rates move lower or with the negative drag on N I B larger on European rates if we start to move.\", 'Hello your expectations or below two percent policy rates you know you mentioned earlier to an hour for the mid year to 25 by the end of the next year would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards to or below two.', 'Chris thank you also depends on how steep or flat the curve is a curve that flat ends would have a more negative impact on margins that curve that remains steep so obviously if rates go well below 2% and approach zero obviously from 2 to 0 the impact on margins is greater than from 4 to 2.', \"So it's not linear but if rates stay between 2 and 2 and a half I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of N I because again the cost of the post it's at those levels will gradually approach zero basically and we will have at least that 2 to 2 and a half percent margin on the asset side. Thanks Chris and the final question please. Last question comes from the line of overgroup from KBW please give ahead.\", 'I think so much for the time to be quick clarifications if I may so first trading income in Brazil has been quite quick now for a couple of courts be negative. Can you give any guidance there second the corporate center N I I should we expect a positive number in Q4. So if you can give a positive number in the market or again any kind you could give third I heard you on the tax rate for the U.S. What does that mean for the group so can you give guidance on the group tax rate thank you.', \"Thank you. In terms of the trading income okay is in any case very small in the context of Brazil total revenue in Brazil's total revenue and it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement on profitability.\", \"Okay the client relating trading income has had strong performance in Q3 okay however recent market volatility around the Brazilian and the Yelp curve left to an important deterioration local assets during Q2 but also in Q3 but we have stabilized those and I believe that the outlook would be much better. This is a challenging market environment and and we've been basically offsetting is going to Q3 and I believe Q4 is going to be much better.\", 'N I I for the corporate center N I I in the corporate centers to gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center so you should expect N I I to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level.', 'And finally the tax rate for the group should be fairly flat next year maybe a touch below what it will be this yet but just marginally so you know for model purposes I will use the same tax rate in 25 than we will have in 24 same tax rate.', \"And I think we've answered all the questions thank you very much everybody investor relations myself factor at your disposal to answer any follow up questions that you may have looking forward to seeing you over the next few weeks on one on once and we'll talk to you again for the fourth quarter earnings in January.

I'm Raul Senna, Global Head of Invest Relations, and I'm delighted to be here joining our Executive Chair, Ana Boutin, our CEO, Hector Grissy, and our CFO, Jose Garcia Cantela. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure for fully-app presentations. Ana will kick off the presentation by talking about our results and achievements in the context of our strategy. Then Hector will add detail to our financial performance.\", 'Finally, Ana will conclude with our outlook for 2025 before opening for Q&A. Ana, over to you. Thank you Raul, and welcome everybody to our full-year results presentation. 2024 was another record year, the third consecutive year of record results for Santander. It shows the benefits of our strategy, the resilience of our business model. As we said, in 23, we have entered a new phase of value creation, and this has enabled us to deliver or exceed all our key financial targets.', \"Profit reached a record of 12.6 billion euros, supported by both strong revenue growth, and customer growth, we grew 8 million customers, and this happened across all our global businesses in a very balanced way. We have continued to invest for the future, and we're making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model through one transformation.\", 'This has been instrumental in improvements in efficiency by more than 2 percentage points, and increasing our profitability ROTE to 6.3. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong capital ratio, ends the year at an all-time high of 12.8, reflecting our ability to generate capital organically. Finally, we delivered again strong childhood value creation with Tina and Diverin pressure growing by 14%.', 'By the way, this is inspired of pressure from currency evaluation in some markets, which was offset by our profitability and the appreciation of the US dollar, with our US business acting as a natural hedge against the pressure on the Brazilian Real, for example. Let me just go into a bit more detail on our fully up performance.', 'Very high quality of results with strong growth in our top line revenue up 10% in constant euros, and as I said, supported by both customer activity and good delivery across all our businesses. fee income is up 11%, again in constant, supported by significant growth in customers of 8 million, and very much the network benefits we are capturing throughout the group, which already represent about 20 billion, about a third of our revenues, due to being part of the Santander group.', 'Expenses grew well below revenue, showcasing again the positive effects of our one transformation, and we delivered record net operating income of 36 billion. Finally, we continued to be prudent in our cost of risk and at 115, better than our initial guidance for the year.', 'Again, we have shown over time that our results are sustainable and less volatile over the cycle than most of our peers, and this is again because we are retail consumer powerhouse with a business model that combines both geographical diversification with business diversification and a strong risk management. You can see here that all of our five global businesses delivered revenue growth, while we improve profitability.', 'The performance of retail consumer reflects the scale and the benefits of our transformation, one transformation, improving efficiency, but also growing customers. Wealth, CIB, and PaganEx have each delivered improved profitability, again leveraging our network strengths and capabilities. The combination of these global businesses with a geographical diversification places us in a very strong spot for the next year and for the future.', 'We are enhancing our disclosure to allow the market, all of you, to better forecast our global businesses in the same way that we have been doing for years internally. I would also highlight that while higher interest rates benefit our retail franchise in Europe, other parts of our business, such as consumer, and certain developing market geographies, will do better with lower rates.', 'And it is this diversification that allows us to deliver current, strong results, consistent, profitable growth, and value creation. Again, our performance this year, the execution of our strategy puts us on track for our 25 financial targets. On retail, which is the heart of our banking business, we are making very good progress. Our aim is to become the number one bank for our customers. One transformation is delivering excellent results.', \"And by the way, there's a lot more to come, growing 4 million, around 4 million active customers with about to 80 million total, with lower cost per transaction. We are improving our digital onboarding, digital sales, grow by 16%. The number of products has been reduced by almost 40%. With special focus on the front book, and this is, you're going to see benefits of this in the next few years, of course. And you will see there's not just on the cost side, but also on revenues for 25, 26.\", \"Second, we are consistently, but the relentlessly deploying our global platform. In the UK, for example, customers have been migrated to the new global app that's already up and running in Spain, Portugal, and Poland. And again, the global platform rollout and improvements in customer experience will drive additional customer growth with lower absolute cost.\", 'In consumer, our priority continues to be delivering the best solutions, but also for our customers, but also improve our competitive advantage on cost across our footprint. You can see here the operational leverage for the year where we are growing revenues at 6 and decreasing cost by 1%.', \"It's been a ground breaking year in our transformation, and a great example of this is our checkout lending platform Zinia, which again, thanks to our scale and teams, we have been able to partner with both Apple and Amazon and Germany. This is absolutely key, not just today, but for the future, to be where our customers are going to be operating with us under our own brand. We have also successfully launched Open Bank in the US and Mexico.\", \"Open Bank US has gathered 2 billion of deposits, that's about double what we expected, and it's also improving our loan to deposit in the US by about 12 percentage points. It's going to allow us to optimize our US funding structure from the beginning. We are reducing the cost to serve in consumer. It's now significantly, as you can see.\", 'And for 25, and this is key, we actually expect in consumer to be one of our best performing divisions in terms of the upside, where the US being one of the countries that most improves the total country P&O. Other three global businesses, well-CIVA and payments, other ones driving fee growth, we anticipated this to you all in 23 due to very strong network effects and also leveraging technology.', 'Our corporate bank, we are focused on the markets where we are present with a strong footprint, and as you know, we are delivering good growth in profits. We are maintaining our usual risk profile. In the US, in 2024, corporate bank fees have increased by 21 percent and revenues are by 14 percent. We are building the best wealth insurance manager in a footprint, again, leveraging on our network.', \"We have revenues of 15 percent in 24 with fees up again, double digits across the three business line. In payments, we are building the backbone to connect the group across different businesses and geographies. It's essential in our one transformation. This is a very big market and a growing opportunity. In 2024, payments volume is up 11 percent and the key metric that we committed to EBITDA margin is close to a 30 percent target for this year, for 25. We are very close to that already.\", 'Going forward and especially in an environment of lower rates in Europe, CIV, wealth and payments are going to be critical in ensuring our targets for this year, including the fee income growth. So all of this performance, the strong operational and financial performance, is driving higher capital generation, double digit value creation and shareholder return, fully loaded CET1, rose to 12.8.', 'At the end of December, January 1st, still to have 0.8, supported by record organic capital generation, after investing in profitable growth, increasing remuneration to shareholders and absorbing regulatory impacts. At current prices, share buybacks remain the best way to generate shareholder value.', \"Since 21 and including this new share buyback we've announced today for the year, on 24 earnings, we will have repurchased 15 percent of outstanding shares with a return on investment approximately 18 percent for our shareholders. And there is more to come. Here we're going to have financial performance in more detail, but let me just briefly, given that I only get a chance to be with you all once a year, at least formally, remind all of you of our model and our strategy.\", \"As I say, this is a marathon. It's not a sprint. And in every single sprint, we're delivering what we committed. And this is because we're delivering numbers and results as we guide you every year, but we're also building the Santander of tomorrow. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform for all our customers. We are working to become more competitive in a way that few others can replicate.\", \"And this is based on a unique combination of a customer base of 173 million customers, a global scale with local leadership, and very important, all of this leading to high visibility of our results and predictability through the cycle. And the biggest area of upside, even today for Santander, comes from the network effects of belonging to the group across our footprint and through the global business. Our confidence in our guidance stems because a lot of what's coming is under our control.\", \"And all of this, let me stress, in what we do anticipate a much more challenging and volatile macro. Just a few examples of how this is not a PowerPoint. This is already delivering numbers and results for our shareholders and for our customers. This is some of the global platforms that are up and running and contributing to the performance and financial performance which you're seeing, and which is increasingly, and this will continue to increase, making us different from our peers.\", 'These platforms will deliver and partly delivering already best services and better efficiency. Open bank is out there to bank, rolled out now in the US and Mexico. Zini I mentioned already, in 24, there were 1.7 million new contracts, and we are signing in new countries with these partners. And gravity, our core system where our partner is Google, is being offered to third parties through our joint venture, but it has already enabled CentaN there to reduce our cost for transaction by 10%.', \"But it's obviously helping us to do much more than that in terms of the frontend systems. Again, we are confident we will compound growth throughout the cycle, creating value for our shareholders. Just a brief reminder of how this business model has already delivered the numbers. You can see it here, sustainable earnings growth year after year, improvements in profitability. Over the last decade, we have doubled our profit.\", 'Actually, we have tripled if you go back to the end of 2013 and a new record again in 24. We have attracted 56 million new customers to CentaN there, our OTA profitability increased to 16.3 from 2011 and 2014. And of course, we have steadily built capital throughout this period. I just want to remind us, actually, when I took over, we started with a CET ratio of 8.3%. And of course, the way we calculate capital is not the same.', 'But very importantly, for you, our shareholders, our shareholders, we have increased six times a whole-terrain generation. We are now closing at 12.8, which is near the top of our target operating range. Let me just stress operating range. We are not changing our target of over 12. And this is, as I just mentioned, despite our double inflation. So last but not least, before I turn over to Ektor, this is our North Star. And this is our North Star since 23.', \"We could not target and commit to Tina and everyone before 23, for reasons that you all know well. The progress towards the targets that we set is well ahead of plan. We continue to be focused on profitability and being very disciplined on capital allocation. Today, we have 87% of our OWA's above cost of equity for the improving our profitability to above 16%. So let me now pass to Ektor who will take you over of national performance in Modiglia. Ektor, please. Yes, thank you, Anna.\", 'I will look at our performance in cost and currency, including the impact of Argentina or a conservative approach to effects was adjusted in Q4. This resulted in a positive impact on NII with a negative offset in other income in cost. Let me start by highlighting our strong top line performance. We achieved double-deeage revenue growth, exceeding the targets we provided at the start of the year, and even the ones we upgraded during the year.', 'This was underpinned by sound growth and customer activity across the businesses while reflecting the benefits of our model. The strong increase was mainly supported by the next things. First, a retail business which continues to grow at double-deegate with good performance and both NII and fees.', \"A record year in CIV, up 14% on the back of our investments and good activity levels, and 15% revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and a really good performance of Santa and Deras' management and insurance. Custom consumer and payments are also showing very good revenue trends with consumer delivering double-deegate growth in fees and both Pagan X and Cards growing. More than 80% of the group's NII comes from our retail and consumer businesses.\", \"The group NII's grew double-deegate in 24, with name up driven by acid repricing and controlled cost of deposits. Over the last few quarters, we have proactively managed our interest rate sensitivity to position our balance sheet for the new outlook on interest rates. In Spain, for example, our NII was flat quarter-over-quarter part of due to our hedges. And in Brazil, our negative sensitivity to a 100-basis points rising rates is now lower at around 120 million euro.\", 'Going forward, our outlook for 25 for the group is similar to what we set in Q3. Excluding Argentina, we expect NII to be slightly open, constant, and slightly down in current durals based on forward rates. In an environment of low-credit demand in general, we generated another record performance in fee income, from network effects from all our global businesses.', 'Retail increased due even by the strong performance across our footprint on the back of good commercial dynamics and the customer growth. In 24, we put a greater focus on deploying targeted high-value other products and services and this is expected to be a positive driver in 25.', 'In consumer, we delivered double-deed growth fees across our core markets, driven by insurance and DCB in Europe, Brazil and out to the US, and in 25 we expect consumer fees to be slightly down due to the impact of the new regulation and insurance. DCB also grew strongly to record levels, supported by all CAB products with a US at top contributor for fees nearly doubled. In wealth, we delivered a very strong performance with double-deed fee growth backed by record assets on their management.', 'Excluding a one-time positive fee recorded in cars who in 23, payments fees were up slightly and are expected to grow strongly during 25. One transformation is key to why we can continue to get better in every single market, thanks to leveraging our global businesses, with expect sustainable improvements in operating leverage as this is a structural change in our model that will deliver benefits for years to come.', 'Retail and consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains, an operating leverage with cost growth of 1%. Well below revenue growth of 9%. These two businesses represent 70% of our cost-base and will continue to see lower cost going forward. CAB and wealth cost, increased by 13% year-on-year, showing positive jobs while driving higher fee income and payments operating performance, reflects our strategic investments.', 'As a result, our cost-to-incompration improved from 41.8 for 24, the best we have ever reported in 15 years and better than our original guidance. There is still more upside over the medium-term format of our strategy. Both revenue and cost. While we are ahead of our plan on execution of one transformation and global tech capabilities, we have more to do capturing network effects across our global businesses.', 'This has delivered 66 basis points of improvements for our cost-to-incompration with more upside to our original target of 100 to 150 basis points. Retail and consumer and more than 70% of our earnings and have significant upside. The rest of our earnings come from wealth, CAB and payments, which are feed-driven and will play to our network strengths. Our balance sheet, as you can see, is rock solid.', 'Credit quality is stable across our footprint ahead of our expectations with low unemployment and easy monetary policies in most of the countries, except for Brazil. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected in both NPL ratio and lower-correct needs. NPL ratio was 3.05% improving both year-on-year and Q&A. The NPL portfolio has collateral, warranties and provisions that account for around 90% of its total exposure.', 'The cost of risk improved to 1.15% better than our target of around 1.2% for the year. In our retail business, 12-month cost of risk improved year-on-year to 0.92%, with sound underlying trends across all the countries. In Brazil, we have grown credit at the slower pace on our peers and have made improvements to our portfolio on the righting over the past few years.', 'Meanwhile, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk finished at 2.16%, in line with the normalization expected in 24, supported by the good portfolio behavior in the US Auto as we had expected since the beginning. Moving on to capital, where we delivered an exceptional outcome in Q4, our city-1 ratio grew by 30 basis points in the quarter, backed by strong organic capital generation. We have been working on accelerating our capital generation for some time.', 'In Q4, we generated 82 basis points organically, in the back of the profit generation and RWA modification. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book, written on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% equivalent to an ROTI of 23%.', \"We have reached 87% of RWA's with returns above the cost of equity, up from 40% in 2015 and well above our target of 85% in 25%. Our asset desk is achieving exceptional results during the year, with a post of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 60 billion in RWA's. The combination of these actions is playing the expanding profitability and the good performance on capital. All in all, we are in a new phase of value creation driven by higher profitability.\", 'Looking back at the period since 2016, our value creation has clearly accelerated and since 2022, we have been able to generate an average 15% value to our shareholders. This is driven mainly by the step-up in our profitability and helped by our diversification. Our exposure to the US dollar through our US businesses has sacked it as a natural hedge against the appreciation of the Latin currencies.', \"Let me highlight the sensitivity of our equity to foreign currency, which clearly shows that currency depreciation in Brazil and Mexico is at least partly of set by our exposure to the stronger US dollar working as a natural hedge. That's all from my side, Ana, over to you. Thank you very much, Ector. So let me briefly sum up our performance in 2024. Once again, confirms our consistent delivery on our plans.\", \"We deliver what we say we will deliver in every single plan and every single year on the key financial metrics for the group. We're on track to either achieve or exceed our financial targets set in 2023. 2024 was another record of a Santander. Our results showed the benefits from our strategy, the resilience of our business model, which again allows us to deliver through the cycle despite volatility. So looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy works.\", \"It's evident in the numbers and that it will continue to drive sustainably higher returns. This is reflected in the targets you can see on the slide for 25, which are based on a mobile hotel context. We do expect volatility uncertainty and a challenging environment for the next year. Our macro outlook includes a mild tariff war, a lower euro rates, also a strong dollar. We expect to deliver resilient revenue despite these lower rates and effects around the same as the zero 62 billion in euros.\", 'It means we will be growing in constant currency and supported by mid to high single digit growth in fees and constant euros. Our aim this year is to reduce cost and absolute terms year on year in euros. Again, positive operating leverage in 25 in spite of these lower rates, mostly in Europe. We are expecting a stable cost of risk at the group level with improvements in some markets of setting others.', 'And again, all of this will lead to increased profitability with returns above 17% on the same basis as we guided in 23 exceeding that top end of our investor day. And I just want to flag that from now on we will report ROT post 81, which is what most of our peers do. With these more conservative lens, we are targeting 16, about 16.5% as you can see. And this again is post 81s.', 'Very importantly, given the strong outlook for capital progress and profitability, we are targeting to distribute euro 10 billion euros in share buybacks to our shareholders for 25 and 26 out of 25 and 26 earnings. This will consist of distributing in line with our existing policy around 50% of our reported profit, which will be distributed approximately 50% in cash dividends and 50% in share buybacks. As you know, we announced the second buyback on 24 earnings today at 1.6 billion.', 'And second, excess capital in the two years. So 25 and 26, excess capital following our annuals and results. And of course, our capital hierarchy, which we can go into later. And again, as always, subject to regulatory approvals and the performance we are outlining to you today. Very importantly, we will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks. Reflecting our improved profitability and improvement ahead.', 'I would like to end by saying again, our not-star will continue to be delivering double-digit growth in Tinavan, dividend pressure through the cycle. So with that, we are here to answer your questions, which I think Raul, you will be managing. Thank you, Anna. Can we have the first question, please? Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press the start 5 on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Ignacio Urlardi from BMP Paribas. Please go ahead.', \"Thanks very much for the presentation. And thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just wanted to thank you very much for the improvement in the financial target disclosure and the fact that I am not using this ROT-P-81. There are going to be questions and have two questions today. After the announcement on the extraordinary distributions, there is going to get further color on the trade of that UC between O'Connick and Inoconic growth.\", 'How excess capital ranks in terms of management priorities in 2025 and 26? Especially in the context of the M&A that we are seeing in the European bank and sector. Second thing is, when I just looked at the results of one transformation, the results are very good. I just wanted to see how much more the group is going to income can improve from here. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ignacio.', \"So yes, it's important to remind, and this is not different, but how we are thinking about the capital allocation going forward, in the anticipated higher profitability and excess capital. First of all, our capital allocation framework has, as I said, already been a fundamental pillar of our strategy and the results we are delivering, and we have been very disciplined and strict. So, first, we prioritize profitable organic growth. Investments across our businesses.\", 'We see ourselves as a compounder. So again, this organic growth creates a compounding effect on earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second. This is followed, of course, by ordinary dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. In terms of an organic capital deployment, we are very clear that it has to be complementary to our strategic aims and generate attractive financial returns that have to be ahead, that surpass those of any organic investments or share buybacks.', \"And last but not least, and this is what we announced today, any incremental capital that exceeds our targets, our target range, actually. And again, I want to be clear that we are not changing the target for capital above 12. We are saying, as you've seen in the guidance, that we will be at 13 percent in 25. So any incremental capital following this hierarchy that I just described, we'll be returned as additional rebuenerations to shareholders.\", \"In terms of cost, and I think I said that and the CEO said that also. This is incredibly important because out transformation, one transformation still has a lot of upside, especially in the retail and consumer areas that are 70 percent of our PAT and 70 percent of our cost. One transformation is already delivering. You can see that in actor slide where you can see that our cost basically flat across retail consumer with a top line growing. But very importantly, we've grown 8 million customers.\", \"This is something you will see in the next few years that we have a strategy and a model with one transformation that scales. We don't have to increase cost to grow customers and grow revenues. I said it also in my presentation that the fact that we have reduced our products on offer and retail by almost 40 percent. You're going to see the effects of that on the cost base, by the way. Also on the revenue side in 25 and 26.\", 'Critical to all of this is that we are aligning our business and operating model and deploying our own tech platforms. This is going to help much more down the road. Just to give you an example, gravity, our core system, which drives a lot of the efficiencies and the front end customer tech platforms is operating in 30 percent of the group. We expect to be at 60 percent by the end of 25. This is hugely important. So again, new paradigm for 25.', \"We are focusing on absolute cost base going down versus 24. Despite effects and inflation, this is something we feel very confident about. Given this is important, I don't know if you want to mention maybe actor a couple of the precise numbers on the different global divisions. Yes, thank you. Asana has said, what is very important to understand is one transformation is just starting.\", \"Let me provide you a little bit more color on the cost of evolution in the quarter by businesses and also the 25 outlook. First of all, as you can see, 24 costs increased by 4 percent year and year, but in real terms, cost only only 1 percent. That's basically thanks to the operating leverage in retail and the cost containment that we have done in consumer despite investments and growth that we have been able to do.\", \"So it's important to say that we are basically changing the engine, we are flying the plane at the same time. Retail and consumer represents around 70 percent of the group cost were flatish while the revenue was up 9 percent. CIV and wealth does around 20 percent of the group cost and they just increase by 13 percent that's how you set in the presentation with positive jobs and showing sustainable income growth around 21 percent.\", \"That's basically what is doing, the investments we are doing are actually representing much more growth in the businesses. There are many 10 percent statements which increase by 8 percent year and year, but that reflects our strategic investments. Let me go directly, I mean retail and on 25, we expect cost down versus 24 in current years and we expect to rate or improve the guidance that we provided for each business at the last investor day.\", \"So that's retail cost to income below the edit target of less than 42 percent and flat excite Argentina so that was basically around 39.7 percent. More cost to income is down and is going to be less than 40 percent and CIV is going to be below 45 percent. Thank you. Thanks, Ector. Next question please. Next question from Mara Sanchez from City, please go ahead. Good morning, thank you very much. My first question is about the UK.\", \"When you say that the market is core, does it also specifically apply to the retail bank, to the ring fence entity? And if that's the case, what do you see sustainable returns in an environment where you have to compete against stronger deposit franchises and new entrants with the pockets? My second question is on the US, you've delivered $1.2 billion this year of net profit, but you're still benefiting from maybe tax credits.\", \"I think you've mentioned on the call that you expect the US to be the largest contributor to earnings growth in 2025. Could you be a little bit more specific about how much you expected to contribute, what are the levers and what is the tax return, sorry, the tax rate that's you. And then just quickly clarification on capital, the threshold for surplus capital distribution is now 13 percent. Thank you. So let me answer the last one first. We're not putting a threshold.\", \"We've said, we will be at 13 by the end of this year. The buybacks will happen in 2526. I have explained a hierarchy, so it will depend on what organic growth we will have. We're going to be very mindful as we have in terms of the reference being buybacks for shareholders, organic growth, supporting affront chis, it's hard to be. So precise, we don't have a crystal ball.\", 'What we do have is a track record that shows that in challenging times we do better than our peers, we are confident that we can deliver the group targets that we just said. So let me just UK US. So in terms of the UK, first is that the outlook for our business in the UK, which is 88 percent retail, continues to be very resilient. And we are committed to the UK. This is a number. UK retail within the group is 9 percent. And UK retail we expect to do better.', 'So again, good outlook for our business in the UK. And by the way, UK NII has bottomed out in the second half of 24. And we expect that to be slightly up next year. Second is crucial to our results and performance in the UK is of course a mortgage. A mortgage lender essentially. And what we are seeing is that asset quality continues to be resilient. We are being very conservative in terms of how we stress. I think we stress around 8 percent.', \"Maybe actor or a hosicon confirm that, but I believe that's a number. So we have very strong underwriting criteria and that is essential for our returns. And third, what we are very confident is that actor has explained it for one transformation. We can do much more in the UK by leveraging the global platforms, bringing out global scale to benefit the UK.\", 'We have already migrated the UK to gravity and some of the improvements are going to be ahead as we improve customer experience but also reduce the cost to serve. So again, there is more upside to our profitability. It remains a co-market as we have said. On the US, I want to first say that we are very committed to having a strict capital allocation. This is really important for us and has been important throughout.', \"The UK has been top of all our countries, all our geographies over the last decade. And top also the last five years. This is really important because we are committed and have been on this capital allocation and returns in euros to Asha Holtz. Part of that is the strong dollar and it is a natural hedge against and even more now that the earnings are going up. So that's the first point. The second is that we refocused our strategy in the US a couple of years ago and we were very clear.\", 'We are not trying to be all things to all people. We want to deliver profitable growth anchored on four pillars. First, our consumer bank. That is 70% of what the US as a geography is. But it continues to improve. Consumer will be one of our best performing divisions in terms of the delta. And that is not just the US but also consumer Europe. With lower rates consumer, which is about 20% of our PAT, will do better and will improve profitability driven by results in the US.', \"We are not going to give a specific number but it's hundreds of millions more if you do the math. Very importantly, the launch of open bank is going to help us optimize funding and even more so in the context of maybe not so much lower dollar rates. In terms of the corporate bank, it's being hugely accretive to our network. If you look at our corporate bank within the group, most of the returns are coming in country. So over half of our corporate bank is actually Brazil and Spain.\", \"The US is helping us to leverage that network. If said, we will not materially increase capital allocation and it's being a very significant driver of fee growth in the US. Corporate investment banking is up 81% year on year. And finally, we have a very profitable, again very much focused on our lifetime franchise worth business. So we will continue to allocate organic capital to the United States and to the Americas. The specific question on taxes. Taxes? Yeah. Either actor or Jose on taxes.\", \"Let me just complement a little bit. I mean, to what Anna was saying. I mean, in the UK, just to give you an idea in terms of what you were asking, revenue is going to be up mid single digits and we expect a lot of around 11%. Okay, I'm talking in constant. We have no view on effects at this point. Okay. It's very important also to tell you that, I mean, we have 14 million clients in the UK. We're starting to sell different products to them.\", \"As Anna said, we have a basically more touch franchise over there, but we're starting doing some other businesses with them. We're starting to do credit cards, credit cards starting to grow is the second largest market in the world. So we're starting to cross selling to that client base. And that basically is helping us out. We have a much better franchise and we have the capabilities to do it because we have a business at scale that allows to do so.\", \"In terms of the US, I'll just give you, I mean, in terms of guidance, as you were asking, I mean, we see revenue up high single digit, okay, an accounting rotate would be around circa 10%. If you adjust the rotate because of the excess capital that we have, we're talking about about a 14%. So it's quite good.\", \"And in regards to what the tax on the tax, I understand, I mean, I explained you very well the situation due to the fact that what we're doing in terms of leasing, we're really going to find out the size of the numbers until we see how we're going to allocate that one throughout the year. So, okay, all right, thank you. Thanks, thanks, Marta. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from the Lange of Francisco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead.\", 'Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first one is on capital. I wanted to ask you about the 13% city one target for 25. If that 13% already includes any special share of a back beyond the ordinary distributions that we should expect in 25 or if the special share of a back will be back and loaded to 26.', 'And in this context, I wonder if you can guide us on the organic generation that we should expect in 25, particularly also on the plans for risk transfers in this year and also on any negative regulatory inputs, a base for other inputs, DTAs in Brazil, etc. And my second question is about Brazil. How do you see your business operating in a higher-saleic environment? What is your appetite for long growth? How big a squeeze from margins from the higher rates?', 'How sensitive the cost of risk to the saleic and then on your, you can update also on your transformation plans here in this market. Thank you. So on capital, let me just give you a high level and then also maybe can give you a more detail or a little bit. But let me just reiterate, we will distribute excess capital and our capital hierarchy is what we have said earlier. Economic growth, distributions, discipline in an organic and extraordinary over those aims.', 'So again, we have a lot of organic opportunity that is profitable. We cannot know how much of that is going to happen. Point number two, we are not changing our target for capital. It will remain above 12%. Our operating range will be between 12 to 13 and the excess buybacks over the ordinary buyback and cash distributions will be during 25 and 26. We are not going to be more precise than that.', 'Again, go back to the hierarchy and we want to have and we want to deliver the best possible for our shareholders. We have that optionality given our model. In terms of the regulatory ladder, do you want to act or who wants to? High back up. Sorry. Sorry, Paco. So, in terms of risk-wether as a growth, we would expect ordinary business-driven risk-wether as a growth of around 4 to 5%. Mostly compensated by asset mobilization initiatives.', \"So net, we would expect to see very little risk-wether as a growth, maybe 1 or 2%. Regulatory charges, we expect to have a figure close to 2024. And again, there is a high degree of uncertainty here because of the technical notes that need to be released by the EVA. But a bit more or a bit less than what we have seen this year. Okay, let me give you the high level on Brazil. Let me just first say that without Brazil, we will deliver on our guidance. That's what we've done for the last 10 years.\", 'In terms of the group, let me remind you 62 billion approximately, flat cost, stable cost of risk with an ROT after 81 of 16 and a half. In terms of Brazil, retail business, which is the one sensitive to moving rates. These are numbers that with the additional transparency on the global business, you can actually hopefully have as much confidence in that we will deliver as we do as a management team. So, retail Brazil contributes about 38% of Brazil net profit.', 'And that is 7% of the overall Santander Group at Tributal Profit. The rest of our global businesses in Brazil, which contribute more than 60% consumer corporate payments and wealth, we expect to continue to do well. By the way, this is more or less the same as for all the other countries. IE for the group, 50% roughly of our bottom line, 60% of our balance sheet is retail. All the other businesses, I said that in my presentation, should grow revenues much more than retail next year.', \"So this is part of the work we've done in one transformation. In consumer, it's part of the work we're doing with our network businesses leveraging on our customer relationships. All in all, what we expect is Brazil wrote to be stable in 25 as a country driven by higher customer revenues and especially fee income. Contained cost, and this is really important, one transformation will also be very important in Brazil with a flat cost to income roughly in 25.\", \"I'm very important we have structurally improved the quality of our balance sheet in 22 and have been prudent on growth. Thank you. We have the next question, please. Hello, from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First of all, I'd appreciate the color you gave earlier on the strategy in the US.\", \"When you see and hear the messaging around potentially a more accommodating regulatory backdrop in that market, how does that impact the business in the US and where does that create opportunities and how could that potentially impact your strategy in the US if at all? And then secondly, that's more of a modeling question. Looking at Q4, there was a higher than usual level of other gains and losses in provisioning and I think the full year number of 4.8 billion was up significantly year ago.\", \"Can you just walk through what is in that line and how much of that is investment into future efficiency improvements, restructuring, etc. and where should that line item trend across 2025 and 26? Thank you. Okay, so on the US, I've said it many times, operating context matters. So yes, other things equal if the operating context improves in the US that will naturally drive better returns, other things equal vis a vis other regions. So we cannot be too specific right now.\", \"We really don't know what's going to happen but everybody and ourselves included is anticipating a better operating context for banks in the United States, which again, other things equal should drive over time at least increased capital allocation, as I've said before. I mean, our investment in the US has always and even more now since we are in a growth mode, leverage the group. Even top of that, we get a better environment. We should do better.\", \"And that's what I said before, the US, as a geography will be one of the biggest upsides in our P&L without being too specific. But I think we said that, the ROTE, Ector said it, he said 14, I would say, Ector respectively between 14 to 15 percent, adjusted ROTE. I hope you agree on that. So yes, 14 to 15 percent. And the reason is very simple, consumer business is 70 percent. That already is higher and what's dragging down this year, but not next year.\", \"And of course, very positive contribution is the CIB investment, which as I said, is leveraging the network. In terms of other, I would let either Ector or Jose to answer in bit more detail. But yes, in that other, there are some one offs, for example, over 300 million, I remember correctly, in Pagonext restructuring. This is going to drive a much better performance in our payments division next year. Again, that's going to be one of the biggest upsides.\", \"So we are being very disciplined, not just without, you know, where do we put our capital in terms of lending, but where do we put our capital in terms of growth? We decided to get out of acquiring in Europe. That is going to drive a much better performance by focusing on our co-markets and acquiring, which is mostly Latin. There's a couple of things that are recurring there and a couple of others that are not. So maybe you want to take that, Ector? Sure, Ana.\", \"I mean, to complete what Ana has said in 24, the following one of the events impacted our Pina Lace, especially. I mean, in Q124, we had a higher temporary levy on the revenue in Spain, that's a $335 million. In Q224, I mean, the write down that she was explaining about Pagonext, in Q3, 70 million related to the foundation. And in Q424, that's 260 million provision taken for the situation with the motor in the UK. So only in all that's basically it.\", \"And we don't expect any of those to basically repeat themselves. Maybe just I mean, in terms of the tax levy in Spain, that we will be basically being impacted on the first quarter this year. Thanks very much, Ector. Any other questions please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Orangistan. Leap please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. I've got a couple of fellows on one on Capital and another one on the global platforms. On Capital, there's a sort of trend globally.\", \"It seems like around the regulation. I just wanted to take your brain down, maybe, on how do you think that's going to manifest itself? Sandana, because ultimately I heard, I'm also guiding for another close to 60 basis points. Capital had to win this year, similar to last year. Obviously, there was a press report here this week where you've taken the ECB, the SEMT to court around the details in Brazil.\", \"So can you maybe give us your latest thoughts on how regulators are going to treat the banks here in Ford and in particular, how do you see that they have a centa there? And second on platform on your consumer retail, I think your cross-think comes now 40%. I've heard your comment during the call. Could you maybe drop us through which countries still need to roll our gravity from here? And what we think about how low those costs and all those cost income can go.\", \"Who do you benchmark yourself against? Can you give us an idea of how good it can get? Thank you. Medium-term doesn't have to. I've heard your targets for this year. Thank you. So Alvaro, that is a tricky question. You're asking me what the regulators are going to do. You know, I wish I knew. But I would say that for the first time in 10 years, the probability, and I've said it publicly, I've said it in many different locations and recent meetings, including, I think, in yours.\", \"I think first, Europe has built 300 billion in capital, something like this over the banks the last few years. The fact that, you know, we have built capital in many cases twice. I mean, our economic capital, we've said many times, is lower than our current targets. And we will keep those targets, of course, because it's something which the market and regulators have surprised us. So we don't want to be surprised, as we said, 12 to 13 is a big buffer on buffers.\", \"But I would say that, again, for the first time in 10 years, and especially given the outlook for the US regulation being, I would say, less. Rather than more, means that at least, and this is, again, what I've said, let's take a pause. Not just on regulation, but how you interpret regulation. We need to be able to compete on a level playing field. DTA is in Brazil. Even in the case of a dissolving the bank, have value. You know, the direct claim against the government.\", \"We feel very strongly that puts us at the disadvantage, as we compete with the US and local banks in Brazil. So, you know, it's not a big number, by the way. It's more a question of principle, because every single bank in Europe has similar issues. So I do think, you know, we should be in a more predictable era, but, you know, the still CRR, there's still models. And so we want to make sure that.\", \"And the big difference is that, in spite of that, given our strong profitability outlook, the change in the model, the fact a lot depends on us. That's why we are saying we are aiming for additional distributions beyond the regular distributions. In terms of retail and the platforms, you've seen it in, you know, we call one transformation for the whole business model across the five divisions. But the biggest upside is on retail and consumer. You've seen that.\", \"I think Ektor just gave you some numbers. There is a lot of upside. Gravity is an enabler. It's not the biggest contributor to scaling. The fact that you have gravity allows you to bring, you know, through APIs, a lot of the other products that we are building, a lot of the other benefits of being cloud-native, payments is another one payments hub, which is still being rolled out. So, a lot of the work is about a lining business model, a lining the organization, and then comes the technology.\", \"And that is why we see a lot of upside in our retail consumer platform, basically bringing together 170 million customers, which, you know, we have about 4 million companies, commercial corporates. But a lot of that is retail consumer. Alvaro, you're fairly quickly. I mean, as Anna was saying, just retail and consumer are the ones that are the most important ones. I mean, in terms of cost to income, retail and consumer is going to be around flat in terms of cost to income.\", \"And consumer basically is going to be down low single-deget. Okay, so that's what we are seeing for 25. Thank you. Thanks very much, Alvaro. If you have the next question, please. Next question from Andrea Filtre from Media Banker. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll start with your guidance. Consensus is over one billion behind your minimum guidance for 2025 profits. Do you see further growth in 2026 or 25? And where is consensus to conservative from your standpoint?\", \"Second question is on one transformation. A bit of a follow-up to what Alvaro just asked. But where are the next geographies you're planning to roll the plan out to? And given you're now looking at absolute numbers, how much do you think one transformation will save in absolute European exitful facing? And finally, capital, 13% city one is what we hoped to convince the market on fundamental capital strength. I hear you on the maintaining 12 to 13% operating level.\", \"But are you amending the 10 to 15 basis points organic city one client per quarter, which was based on a much lower profitability and approach to risk with the asset? And for second, please make explicit what sort of regulatory hurdles you're expecting for in basis points. Can you just say we will be seeing that to 2024. Thank you. So the answer to your first question without being very specific on numbers is, you know, we will grow our bottom line and we will grow our profitability in 25.\", \"I think I can say that our expectation is this will continue in 26, 27. We'll get a lot more detail in our next investor day, which we expect to do towards the end of this year or beginning of next year. The model still has a lot of upside. As I've said today, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a group in a context that we do anticipate and we count will be volatile. So we're challenging.\", \"We're saying we will grow profits and profitability with stable cost in euros and cost coming down and stable cost of risk. So again, yes, Santander will continue to deliver increasing profits and profitability with all the evidence and with all the obviously market assumptions we're making. In terms of one transformation, at the end, you know, we are aiming to grow customers, grow revenues and improve efficiency. This is not about cost savings.\", \"This is about changing fundamentally how we operate the bank. We are working across the bank to make sure there's end to end accountability, for example. The same way we're building payments or gravity, we're going to build investments and others. What this means is that you're going to see the savings not just in one country, but in the global business, benefiting all the countries. This is a very important difference.\", \"As I said before, by being part of Santander, we are generating 20 billion already today of network efficiencies. This is how we will generate further efficiencies. Today we're still building investment products in open bank and retail in wealth.\", \"As of next month, we're going to have an actor, please confirm this, because that's actually between both of us, but under actor, once we create a single investments platform across the group, we're going to save money, we're going to build a better investment platform and we're going to grow faster. You need to think of this by global businesses. Having said that, what is at the end the bottom line best performing division next year?\", \"In terms of the delta, retail will be more or less flat in terms of profitability because, yes, rates matter. Not as much as people think because if you go country by country, it's only 50% roughly, 55, 45. That is retail and of that, there is the diversification by country. Again, you'll see absolute cost savings across the divisions and some of that will benefit one country more than other.\", \"Maybe actor, you want to add to that briefly in terms of in a minute, but in terms of capital, just going, regulatory hurdles, maybe Jose, you can take that more detail. 12 to 13 is operating range. We've been very clear on that. 13 is not a new minimum, but it is where we want to be by the end of this year. We will distribute excess capital following a capital hierarchy of more or less organic, profitable growth. Again, that's difficult to predict.\", \"We want to make sure we maximize shareholder value creation. 1015 basis points per quarter. That is actually much more than that now, but why don't I let you answer that? Hi Andrea. In terms of the regulatory charges, it's a combination of lots of small things in terms of model reviews and updates, inspections and the potential impacts from the RTSS published by the EVA. In terms of 10 to 15 per quarter, we are not changing that. I think we have great growth opportunities as I discussed.\", \"The most important thing is not evenly distributed throughout the year. It's the growth in capital as we saw this year. It's 10 to concentrate on the end of the year, second quarter and fourth quarter. Thank you Andrea. You are too complemented. There are three important points. I want to be brief. First of all, we are becoming the number one back to our customer. That's the most important change of the model. That's why you see fees growing.\", \"If you analyze contrary eye-contry, you will see, for example, in retail, this is the biggest change. That's basically guiding you meet high single-dead growth in terms of fees. That's the change of the model. Remember that also the change of the model is not just the platforms. It's basically simplification, which is helping us and is dropping the amount of products. Now we just offered no more than 50 products to our customers.\", \"We still have a lot of the backlog, without automatizing all of that. So automation is another very important part. And then the deployment of the platforms, for example, we finished the deployment of one up all of Europe. You see the results of the NPS on the UK. Now it's coming down to Brazil. Meet part of the year. It's going to be in Mexico and then it's coming down to Chile and Argentina. And that you're going to be basically see the results, which will improve first of all.\", \"And then we'll be number one bank to our customers. And second, the fee generations. Thank you. Thanks very much, Hector. We have the next question, please. Next question from the line of Cecilia Romero from Marcus. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the results. My first one is in Europe, where do you see the most significant opportunities for expansion and growth of within the two-year geographically?\", \"You talked about the US, but is there any other countries where you see the one gaining a scale? For example, Mexico. Also, I wanted to ask you on the quarter in regards to the very different dynamics that we're seeing in Portugal and Spain and I. Spain was flat and Portugal at minus 11%. Could you explain why such a divergent trend and is this where we're going to see in 2025?\", 'It was serious and I am Spain and I am Portugal, Pauline, I will be just and you please let us know what your race assumption is in this garden. Thank you. So in terms of growth for the next couple of years and again, we are looking at this by global businesses. So and I will give you a detail by country within the global business in terms of growth and this is important. Retail will not grow much in the next year. 26 will see what happens to growth and revenues.', \"We are putting much more emphasis at least for now on profitability. We've grown 8 million customers. We're growing the top line not just because of the euro rates benefit this year but also because 8 million customers is a lot of customers. So again, given the context, our top line in retail will not grow as much in 25 within that there will be differences as I've said.\", 'If you look at within retail what are the countries that will grow more or less, I mean obviously in the euro area will grow less because of the impact but fees will grow to compensate partly and 50% of our businesses that are not retail will all grow the top line and the bottom line. Including consumer in the US and Europe. That is why I said the US will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower rates even I want to stress not as low as probably the market things.', \"I will let maybe also give some of the assumptions behind these numbers. In terms of NII in Spain and Portugal, let me go back again to the global business and I will tell you within that. So if you look at retail, you know, the countries that will grow will not be the European countries. Top line I'm saying profitability will be the same maybe a bit lower in some of them and higher in others within retail. Overall the retail and again the four big countries are roughly 70% of retail.\", \"The other 50% is not sensitive to higher rates. Sorry it's not rate sensitive but it does at least as well if not better again given the investments with the lower rate environment. For Spain, you can give the maybe the guidance for Spain which is one of the guidance we're going to give. Okay so let me very quickly go through the measures we've taken to decrease the interest sensitivity in the eurozone. We have taken three very important measures.\", 'One we have an alcoporfolio that has been created in the last year and a half. Right now in the eurozone we have a total of 67 billion euros of government bonds. The second we implemented hedges on the asset side of the balance sheet particularly mortgages through four war starts that go up to two years and we also increase the percentage of liabilities at variable rates.', \"With this if you look at NIA in Spain in the fourth quarter with which basically concentrates on the retail business you see a negative impact of around two percent from volumes and also margins that decreased around 17%. But this was compensated by the positive impacts of these measures that I just mentioned. Hedges added around a hundred million euros to NIA and the alcoporfolio around a hundred and eighty million euros to the NIA. That's why NIA in the quarter was basically flat.\", 'Going forward NIA in Spain again which is mostly and primarily concentrated in the retail business. If race stay and stabilize at around two percent we would expect to see NIA in Spain to drop between five to six percent next year. So that is the sensitivity. But let me let me reiterate again that we have decreased the percentage of assets and liabilities subject to rates in Spain. In December twenty two seventy percent of 76 percent of assets was floating.', 'Forty six of liabilities was floating. In December twenty four only sixty four percent of assets were floating and fifty one percent of liabilities were floating. So we decrease the sensitivity on the asset side while increase the sensitivity on the liability side. So we are much better prepared for lower rates. Thanks very much Jose. We have the next question please. Next question from the line of Carlos Pichoto from Kashabang please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good morning.', \"Thank you for bringing my question. I was on shift the question a bit to Mexico. So you had a relatively good performance in the in the quarter. I was wondering how do you see how do you expect a motion in terms of long volumes and also an NIA into 2025. You know, whether you have any sensitivity to any impact that potential tariffs which were not delayed for a month or less, let's see what happens there.\", 'Well, basically you have views on how could that affect overall activity in the country particularly in the global areas in the CIV business in Mexico, which by the way, if you could tell us how much it accounts for Mexico contribution to the interesting. And then just a small clarification on the on the on the capital organic generation that you mentioned before the 10 to 15 basis points per water.', \"I just wanted to understand the stats already net generation from net from off the regulatory impact to 60 basis points you mentioned or is that before the regulatory impact. Thank you very much. So again, let me just reiterate and I'll get to Mexico in a minute, but you know, we have significant business and geographic diversification Mexico like other countries is roughly 50%.\", 'I think probably between 45 to 55 is retail and the percentage of revenue and roughly also bottom line of Mexico when it reaches 12 and Mexico is around 15% of the total. So again, not a huge contribution on retail, which is going to be the one most sensitive to volumes. Half of our business and I let actor go into that in more detail is with corporates and affluent. We have a lot of high quality business in Mexico, actually the biggest opportunity is in the retail IE and the mass market.', 'We have also launched open bank there to take advantage of that and we have been very prudent in terms of our lending much more than other peers. We have focused of the last few months actually on the high quality segment. So clearly the Mexican economy could be more affected than others, but it should not have a significant impact on our expected delivery. So maybe you want to give a bit more color on Mexico.', \"I think just feeling very well and I mean the fact of the matter is that we have been, I would say prudent given the environment in Mexico. We've been growing a lot less than our competitors because we believe that it was important to be conservative. We are very much concentrated on going towards the part of the portfolio that has collateral.\", \"We've been concentrated a lot more on auto loans, on mortgages and we've been decreasing even though we have been growing in consumer, not as much as the rest of the market toy. Basically very comfortable of what are we doing there. And I believe that the ideal side I can give you, given that we are including a mild trade war, we're talking about Mexico in terms of revenue, up high single digits. And in terms of our rate between around 22% to 22% again, it's in constant nobion effects.\", \"Thank you. It's pretty regulatory charges. Thanks very much Jose. Can we have the next question please? Next question from the line of Trophy Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, this is the feedback from JP Morgan. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the guidance, I know you have now given guidance for net interest income in Spain that is going to be done for the sixth, third, third, third, third quarter.\", \"You gave guidance on a country by country level for net interest income. But that'd be possible to also get now for 2025. And then my second question would be, I knew you've mentioned that UK is the core part of us on the near but you focus on organic growth. But if you could talk about M&E, how you view your peers that are having involved in M&E, do you think that will change the European banking landscape and how these see something there?\", \"You have a lot of positions in landscape where you have more M&E and how you can evaluate any opportunities that are always stopped. But then she imports you gold and she is out there in Europe. So if you get comment on this, thank you. So we're going to give, just on your first question, thank you. We're not going to give detailed NII by country. We're going to give most of the countries and Jose can explain that.\", \"I'd like to go back to what we are committing and it's on the last slide or I think the last slide in the presentation. We have a revenue in euros 62 billion roughly the same as this year, mid-high single-digit growth and fees. And then by divisions, I think we have given also, you know, and I think Ektro has mentioned retail which is 50% of the group, flat revenues and more or less flat returns, consumer.\", 'So mostly 90% of that is Europe and the US revenues up mid single-digit and profitability improving significantly including in the US. Our corporate bank which is about 20% of our profits and 14% of our revenues, revenues up profitability improving to 20% which is roughly what we said would be by this year. We have 10% of our wealth, 10% payments, a big delta because of the restructuring. So I think that is much more detailed with giving you and I think I cannot add much more on that.', 'In terms of the UK and MNA, I want to say several things. First, we do not need to buy a cell to allocate capital to the more interesting opportunities for Santandercia holders where we combine, you know, profitability growth franchise. So that is what we are doing in a very dynamic way across our footprint. In terms of how we think about this, I want to go back to what I said, I think at the beginning of the call in terms of how we think about capital allocation.', 'In a context where we anticipate excess capital given the higher profitability, we are being very strict and very disciplined. First, we prioritize profitable organic growth and investments across our current footprint. This is how you should think of us. We are a compounder. We are going to compound earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second is ordinary dividends and distributions including buybacks. Third, inorganic. Let me just say this again.', 'It must be complementary to our strategic aims, generate attractive financial returns which means that they have to surpass those of organic investments or share buybacks. And then, and this is the first time in 10 years, we anticipate excess capital given our plans. I want to reiterate again, we are very, very good at predicting within a range of 2 to 3 percent on average the last 10 years. Actually, you can go back more. Some of our shareholders know this.', \"Every quarter, we have very little earnings volatility. This perception of volatility is not based on facts, it's based on perception. So again, any incremental capital that exceeds our target range operating, we're not actually, sorry, that exceeds the other opportunities I just mentioned would be returned as additional remuneration. And that's how we think about inorganic. Let me just say that the framework in Europe is not there for cross-border M&A.\", \"And that is why you're seeing, you know, some of our peers that don't have alternative profitable growth, looking more at in market M&A. But that's not where we are. Can we have the next question please? Next question from the line of Antonio Real from Bank of America, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Just two questions from me, please. So you've introduced this new commitment to pay 10 billion buybacks over 25 and 26.\", \"You've talked about shifting capital within the group rather than asset sales. And this has been an important part of your strategy. Maybe can you talk a little bit more about that point to give us a sense of the flexibility that you retain to shift capital across the group, meet your profit guidance and still achieve the buyback commitment should the macro picture worse and just to get a sense of the flexibility that you retain there on the capital optimization.\", \"And the second point you've mentioned the group is highly diversified. You've given I think a very good overview of your expectations for 2025 across products. Can I go just go back to Brazil and could you share the same for the region? It's a relatively large share of your group and it's a market focus region, particularly dig more into the link between net interest margins, loan origination and affordability ultimately reflected in cost of risk for Brazil.\", \"And maybe the measures that you've put in place at your local unit to go through the cycling cycle, please. Thank you. So I mean, just to give you some color on, you know, organic capital across the group. So we started working on this 10 years ago. We didn't have the tools to manage regulatory capital. We always very good at managing economic capital. Today we have a very dynamic capital allocation strategy.\", \"So we shift on a weekly basis where we put more or less capital, depending on the opportunities. Of course, there's a franchise consideration. I mean, you know, why would we write lots of mortgages in Spain below 2% when I can get much better value in mortgages in Mexico? This is one of the reasons that giving guidance very specifically on countries is not something that we're very good at.\", \"We're very keen on because, you know, we will deliver at the group level and we're making more and more profits and increasing profitability because we are managing an economic way. We do not have a crystal ball, right? We don't know what the peers are going to do. We don't know exactly what the rates are going to be. So we manage this. It reports through the chief investment officers to the CFO and to the CEO who are top down managing this with a global business and the countries.\", \"This is really the huge advantage you have with Santander 87% and we are, you know, prioritizing profitability ahead of growth. But as I said, 8 million customers, new customers in the context of focusing on profitability. Can you imagine once we are at the levels and our operating platform is more competitive, which it will be, we can have organic growth for many years to go. So yes, that is what we do every day. I don't know, exaggerate, but every week.\", \"So going back to that, I defer to Héctor José, but on Brazil, I think we've said. So, you know, Brazil as a country, I think, Héctor has said it, but if not, let me reiterate. We expect revenue to go up and more or less stable returns. That is why we see Brazil.\", \"But let me just be very clear that as I said before, you know, if you look at the retail business and how much of the retail business, which is 50% and the most sensitive one to what rates might do or not, you know, retail Brazil is about 23%. No, retail Brazil is 23% of retail of the group, right? Half of the top line and the business of Brazil is non retail roughly. And that is not sensitive to rates. Obviously cost of risk matters, but that is something which we've also been diversifying.\", \"So again, Brazil should do about the same as this year in terms of profitability with higher revenues and the 50% that is not retail, which is not right sensitive being one of the drivers in Brazil this year. Just to compliment what Anna said, okay, it's very important that Brazil is the place that you can see where we're changing the model in terms of NII being, I mean, being not the driver, but actually being feast the driver in the sense that we're doing things.\", \"The positive feast is exactly what we're concentrated on. We have changed a mix of the portfolio. This basic Mexican basically making us most resilient to rates and has reduced the sensitivity to higher rates through the hatching where 100% hatch for 25 on the PNL in Brazil. So it's very important that you know that. It's also important to tell you that the current deal, the course step and you have a similar smaller impact than previous expected as I told you.\", \"As of December, 100 basis point of our move on the sale has an impact of around 120 million of NII. So we're pretty much hedge. All the structure is basically in place and we believe that on quality, even though we remain vigilant over the past few years, he has grown lending slower than peers and we have tightening the underwriting criteria. So the current economic forecast for GDP and grow to slow, but we remain positive during the year. A cost of risk in another cases scenario.\", \"Do you changes on the portfolio? We see the cost of risk to perform marginally weaker than in 24, but really not changing the outlook for the overall cost of the risk. This is exactly going back to what Ana was saying. It doesn't impact the rest of the group. It's quite small and it doesn't change overall picture. Diversityification is the essence in the group. Thanks very much, Hector. Since we're running out of time, can we take the last two questions, please? On the next question, please.\", 'Next question comes from the line of bitsmiths from autonomous. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just to make sure that we interpret the power garden correctly and timing, I guess is relevant here. You got to a 13% C-81 ratio after 50% ordinary payouts and 60 basis points of regulatory headwinds. And you would consider dropping below that with access distribution in 2025, but not to go below 12.5 performer.', 'And then the second question is to Sombrezill again on the DTA or DTCs, rather why has the ECB now changed its view on this? Has anything been recorded in the Q4 C-81? And what is the maximum remaining risk here in an adverse decision? Or is the decision is maintained? Thank you. Okay, so let me just be clear. We will not be below 13% this year. Our intention is to operate at 13%.', \"But we are leaving ourselves flexibility depending on the capital hierarchy I described organic, you know, profitable growth, which we're very keen to make sure we take advantage of distributions, making sure that any in organic, which we're not counting on for any of the distributions. Everything we're saying is organic growth, organic distributions, etc. Being more than buybacks, etc.\", 'So again, we are aiming to be at 13% and have some flexibility going forward between the 12 and 13, being always above 12, which is where we are. In terms of the, let Jose answer the one on the DTAs, the reason we are contesting this is because we believe that, you know, level playing field, an asset which in Brazil is valid, you know, full claim against the government where other banks operating in the country, US or local banks have a different treatment.', \"We think that that does not make sense. It's a question of principle, the effect is not going to be much up or down Jose. No, the the the the the action of Brazilian monetizable DTAs from capital was already taken in the fourth quarter. So if this ruling is is not in favor basically maintains ECB's interpretation, and not be impact, there will be no impact on capital. Thanks very much Jose, very clear. Can we have the last question please?\", \"Last question from the line, Matthew Serezos from UBS, please go ahead. I have more and thank you for taking my question. I've got two on the asset mobilization efforts. The first one is, you can give us some detail on the breakdown of those measures, both from the geographical point of view in terms of the long books, basically, you're using to accelerate capital optimization.\", 'And the second question is, if you have an internal limit in terms of how much you can do per annum, and if you can see any regulatory constraints in terms of amounts, actually, you can do at some point in the future. Thank you. Thank you, Nacho. The around a third of what we do is heges, one third is, as a disposal, and a third, more or less, is SRT, is synthetic secretizations.', 'We do this in all geographies, obviously synthetic secretizations is mostly in developed economies in hard currency, but the other strategies we are doing in all geographies. As long as we are not the best tenors, the best holders of some of the assets we originate and someone is willing to buy these assets below our cost of capital, we will continue mobilizing the assets. Last year, the average cost of equity, at which we mobilized the assets, was around 8%.', \"Compared with our cost of capital, whatever, 14% or 15% of whatever. So as long as that's the case, we will continue to mobilize the assets. Now, going forward, as we optimize the back book, most mobilization we will be related to the front book. So you should expect to see a gradual reduction in the total amount, because it will be more related to front book, not so much as it's been the case of far, to the back book. Thanks very much Jose.\", \"With that, we are at the end of the Q&A session, I will hand back to Anna to conclude. So thank you so much, Raul, thank you everybody. I just want to reiterate, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a group. We believe 2025 will be more challenging, will be volatile. We are preparing for things to be exciting, even Rocky, maybe at times this year.\", \"And we are very confident that our strategy is working, that our model is going to mean that we are going to do better than peers this year in what, you know, again, we know is not going to be any see year. So thank you again, and see you soon. This completes our call. We look forward to catching up with all of you in our usual road shows, and we will reach out to anybody who didn't answer, managed to get asked a question separately offline as well. Thanks very much. You\"], [\"Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO Mr. Ector Grisi and our CFO Mr. Jose García Cantera. Following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session.\", 'As a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star 5 on your phone. With this I will hand over to Mr. Grisi, Hector the floor is yours. Thank you Begonia. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First I will talk about our Q&A results within the context of the strategy we outlined our investor day.', 'Jose García will review our financial performance in greater detail and finally I will conclude with final remarks. Before we start let me briefly remark that during the first quarter the financial system has experienced situations we felt confirmed that our strategy and unique business model are key factors that allow us to deliver solid and resilient results. Many in times of market volatility as we have demonstrated today through our first quarter performance.', 'As we announced at the investor day we have entered a new phase of shareholder value creation. We are focused on my semaxime value creation aiming for the first time ever to deliver double GG growth in tangible net asset value per share plus dividend per share. With solid capital generation and efficient capital location that will allow us to improve our profitability and provide more return to our shareholders.', 'And we will achieve it thanks to first our unique combination of local leadership and our global scale and network that very few others can replicate. Our business model based on customer focus, a scale and diversification which provide us growth, cost and profitability competitive advantages which is underpined by an ambitious transformation plan that is already making Santa there a digital bank with branches. Today we delivered a solid Q1 with great progress in all our strategic objectives.', \"Tina ProZPS improved 5% in the quarter. A strong capital generation increase are fully loaded CET1 ratio to 12.2%. And discipline capital allocation improved the percentage of RWA's that create value and return on tangible equity reached an extraordinary 14.4%. In a difficult environment we are growing customers and volumes. The post it increased 6% year on year which are of a double digit revenue increase with good cost control.\", 'At the same time we have maintained very solid liquidity ratios as a result of our conservative financial management strategy and accredited quality of our immense stable with cost of risk well below our target in line with the medium low risk profile of our business. This strength resulted in a profit of 2.6 billion, the highest in the last 5 quarters, while profitability improved and we also delivered a strong capital generation.', 'Olinol were on track to reach our 2022 targets I will provide more details later. Moving on to the income statement. Firstly as we usually do we present growth rates both in euros and cost and euros. There was no material difference this quarter. Secondly in January we recorded a 224 million charge related to extraordinary banking tax on revenue in Spain. 202 million accounting in Spain and 22 million in DCB.', 'Excluding this impact profit rose 10% compared to the same quarter last year, 8% in cost and euros. Additionally we have positive and negative one of impacts in Brazil which do not affect profit. To better explain the business trends they have been netted in the underlying PNL. Jose will go in more detail on this. And thirdly the most notable movements in the quarter were strong top line performance supported by NII and higher fees supported by global and network businesses.', 'Costs have started the year in line with expectations growing one point below inflation. We demonstrated the sustainability of our results with double digit growth in net operating income which rose to 8 billion. From a creative quality perspective long lost provisions continue to normalize Jose will go into more detail on all these points later. This is a great start of the year.', 'Good business dynamics are translating into double digit revenue growth within an increasing year on year a close of regions and global businesses. We are implementing our one transformation project which is helping us improve efficiency ratio to within the range of 44 to 45% that we established for 2023 and which makes us one of the most efficient global lines in the world. Our cost or risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at the end of the year.', 'Our rating will quarter on quarter to 14.4%. If we do not analyze the story in our banking tax in line to which our year end target. And we generated capital equivalent to 17 basis points after having completed the second share by Vax program to reach a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In summary very positive trends which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters as we progressed towards the 2022 financial targets that we provided during our 2022 annual resource presentation.', \"As we announced at our investor in February we are building a digital bank with branches that makes our customers' lives easier. With processes and products there are simpler and more attractive to them. These together with a global network are helping us to improve the levels of our activity, revenues and cost. This approach combined with a discipline capital allocation are the cornerstone of our value creation model. Now I will dedicate some time to explain how we are progressing.\", 'Our customer focus is driving volume and revenue growth across the group. We are progressing well in the initiatives. That will help us to improve the way we serve our customers and let me explain some of the most relevant ones. We are also taking advantage of our network effect to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model that is growing at very high rates. Multilatinas and multi-Europeans are increasing revenue 53% and 72% year-on-year respectively.', 'We are also moving fast in the construction of our branch of the future to offer a best in class omni-channel experience across all the group. A good example of this is significant advances made in the digital and boarding processes in Mexico. We have a program that aims to better serve our customers through the use of data which targets 80% of our customer base.', 'It would help us to personalize our product offering, improve interaction with our customers and provide them with the best user experience. We have developed a common mobile app across Europe as a tactical solution while we implement the common front across all the group which is already live in Spain, Portugal and Poland and will be also released in the UK in the end of 2023.', \"Customer reception has been strong as I'm showing in Portugal where we have improved for number 5 to number 2 by customer satisfaction that this NPS through the mobile channel since the app was released. Our efforts to become a fully customer centric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers, loans, deposits and transactions per active customer at a very significant pace as shown on the right side of the slide.\", 'What customer focus is not enough, simplification and automation are also needed and we are making a good progress in simplifying our product offering and fully automating our front and back end operations. This is reflected in our leading position in efficiency and significant growth of 10% in net operating income per customer year and year. As we have discussed, one transformation is improving our local bank operations.', 'We are bringing our 160 million customers onto a common operating and business model while converging into a common technology. We are simplifying our product offering to improve our customer experience and reduce the cost. We also have already simplified our product catalog by 42% since we started the project two years ago. We are reducing also administrative and operational task and branches.', 'We aim to optimize around 80 to 90% of the overall customer related processes and we are progressing well. Spain, for example, has already optimized 40% of the processes in scope for 2023 and is expected to provide significant improvements. We are leveraging our global technology capabilities to accelerate digital transformation in Europe to make our processes fully digital and to end.', 'Finally, we are migrating our core banking system to the cloud, a project which we call gravity, making it more efficient, modern and scalable. This should result in the annual efficiencies of around 150 million upon full implementation with a 67% return on investment and a payback of three years. Overall progress at the group is at 30%. As we have completed gravity in Santa under UK for a corporate platform, migrations in CIB and Chile are expected to be concluded before the end of 23.', \"These are just a few examples of our ambitious transformation program that will bring Santa under operations to the next level. Moving to our global and agro businesses, the revenue is growing above the group average and already represents 39% of the group's total revenue. Several actions and initiatives to the revenue growth are already in full swing. CIB is still growing strongly after record highs in 2022.\", 'We are strengthening the centers of expertise with value-aldued products and services, developing global and regional platforms, focussings and on our areas of strength such as energy, transition, infrastructure or projects, trade finance among others. In the U.S., we are reinforcing CIB coverage teams, strengthening product capabilities and fully leveraging the integration of APS to expand our ability to distribute risk assets. World management and insurance revenue will 43% year-and-year.', 'We are working to maintain the positive trends by scaling up alternative and institutional products and promoting collaboration between World Management and CIB, offering private banking and asset management products and services to LCIV clients and vice versa. In Pagonex, which is also growing strongly, we have progressed with the migration of Santa under payments in Spain to our payments hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in Europe.', 'Our channel-acquiring expanded its innovative value of services which have reflected in 27% year-and-year growth in total payment volumes. Auto revenue fell affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in Scusa, as well as the negative sensitivity to interest rates. We have recently announced an agreement with F. Stellantis in Europe to become its key financing partner with SPIRT to increase the outstanding portfolio by 30% to 40 billion by 2026.', 'At the same time, we continue to leverage relationships with OEMs, importers and mobility providers to grow our businesses in North and South America. We further strengthen our relationship and capital position. Our overall risk profile remains medium low and is proving to be predictable based on our diversification. Cost of risk is to have 1.05%. Provisions continue to normalize year-and-year as suspected.', 'LLP performed well in the quarter as provision dropped 3% mainly driven by South America and North America. At the same time, we deliver strong capital generation. Our CET1 ratio reached 12.2% after having absorbed the full impacts from the Second Survive Act program and the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, Jose will provide more details in a moment. We will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and check hold of value creation on profitability.', 'As I mentioned earlier, our ROTE closed at 14.4% of 100 basis points in the quarter. If we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in Spain, ROTE would have been around 15.3%. Earnings per share grew to 15 cents, 11% higher than the 2022 quarterly average supported by strong profit growth and lower number of shares following the buyback programs.', 'Additionally, in the quarter we delivered 5% growth in shareholder value creation as our result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks. At current share prices, buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. We completed last Friday the second 2022 share buyback program having reported around 7% of our outstanding shares in the last two years which provides a return on investments of approximately 21% to our shareholders.', \"This results demonstrate that Santander has a strong model and risk management capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environments. Jose will go now into more detail on the group's performance in 2023. Please Jose. Thank you, Ector and good morning everyone. Following our CEO's presentation I will go into more detail on the group's P&L, risk profile and capital performance.\", 'Starting with the income statement, I will explain the account line by line in the following slides but let me make a few initial comments. As he has been mentioned, we had some one of results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in Brazil for 261 million, 211 million in NII and 50 million in tax recovery and two provisions made to strengthen the balance sheet totaling 474 million which net of taxes is 261 million.', 'So these movements had no impact on profit and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying P&L and ratios to facilitate comparisons with previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the year end guidelines we gave at the investor day. Additionally, the P&L includes the extraordinary banking tax in Spain which we did have an impact on attributable profit.', 'On the right hand side you can see the upward trend in profit quarter on quarter, 23% if we exclude the banking tax which was driven by top line growth. Going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in cost in euros, we maintain our strong revenue improvement.', 'In the first quarter revenue was 3% higher than in the fourth quarter of 22, 1.5 billion higher than in the first quarter of 22, boosted particularly by NII which increased 1.2 billion but also by fees almost 300 million more. We have a balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates mainly in Europe which coupled with healthy volume growth and an active margin management led to a strong NII improvement in the last few quarters.', 'Therefore, the first quarter 23 was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the Americas. We had good income growth supported by value added products and the network effect. Trading gains, a small portion of potato revenue rose driven by customer base CIB transactions and here is important to take into account that 97% of our CIV revenue is customer driven. Finally, other income increase as the fourth quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution.', 'Group NIA rose 14% year-on-year supported by volumes interest rate increases and manage management as I just said. In terms of volumes, loans were up year-on-year with double digit growth in DCB and South America. North America rose 6% and Europe was stable with falls in Spain and Portugal mainly driven by prepayments of mortgages to individuals. Overall loans grew 3% by backed by consumer and mortgages.', 'Likewise the deposits increased 6% with Europe growing 4% and South America, North America and DCB growing around 10%. I will go into more detail on our loan and the post-structure later. User rate hikes mainly benefited Europe, Mexico and the corporate center. The latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration. On the other hand, Brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products and Chile and DCB were affected by their negative sensitivity to interest rates.', 'Group net interest margin improved from 2.45% to 2.63% as we continued to actively manage our margins. We are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the repricing of loans. After the market movements at the beginning of the year, our deposit betas are on track with the numbers provided at investor day. So we expect this positive and eye performance to continue in 2023.', 'Turning to net fee income, it rose 7% year-on-year reaching more than 3 billion, which is explained by more customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking. CIB, which stood out with a 16% growth in all regions, but especially in Europe, very positive trends in Pagonext and Cards. And in wealth management and insurance, we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in asset management recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of 1.7 billion.', 'Finally, in Auto, volumes growth across the board continue. However, fee income in Europe was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany. The evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to be more capital light. Moving on to costs. The first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures, costs continued to increase below the rate of inflation. This was the case many in Europe, where costs in Spain, the UK and Portugal fell around 3% to 4% in real terms.', 'A salary is in Poland and Latin America tend to be more directly linked to changes in inflation. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%, having improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Outstanding performance in Europe, improving its efficiency ratio by 6% points year-on-year.', \"We will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets, and as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer, and as a result, continue to improve the net operating income per customer, as sector just explained. Credit quality remains robust, and the cost of risk is well under control. Lonelot's provisions grew year-on-year, driving the cost of risk to converge towards the through the cycle average as expected. The main changes by countries were the following.\", \"Improvement in the cost of risk in Spain and Mexico, credit normalization in the US, from the very low levels we saw in 2021 and in 2022, but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we thought. Poland increased its Lonelot's provisions, impacted by higher Swiss mortgage provisions. And finally in Brazil, we had higher Lonelot's provisions year-on-year on the back of individual consumer lending as well as overall portfolio growth.\", \"On a quarterly basis, Lonelot's provisions fell, and the three-month cost of risk in the quarter was 4.4%. This performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio. The non-performing loan ratio continued to improve, falling to 3.05% from 3.26% in March 2022. The main improvements came in Spain and DCB, in part due to portfolio sales in the period and as well as Mexico. The portfolio distribution by stages remained stable.\", 'On the right hand side, there is a brief overview of our Lonelot portfolio structure. One 80% of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets and if we look at the segments our mortgages have low average loan to values. The consumer lending portfolio is well-coloured, realized, short-term and has high returns. And the SME and corporate portfolio is well-covered as well as over 50% has guarantees. Finally a high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade.', \"We mainly comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate which is controlled and diversified across countries. Our exposure to Cree is 6% of total groups drawn and committed exposure. This is concentrated in the US, the UK and Spain, accounting for 75% of the total. Over half corresponds to social housing in the UK and multifamily in the US. The NPL ratio is 1.6% below the group's total NPL ratio.\", 'In the US we have a total of 21 billion of total drawn and committed exposure with an average loan to value of between 50 to 60%. Office Cree is just 2 billion and it has an occupancy rate of 92% compared with around 80% for the sector as a whole. Let me also go into more detail in Brazil and the US to countries that have raised some questions in the past quarters.', 'In Brazil the Brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years and interest rate hikes were implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages. This environment accelerated the credit cycle and increased cost of risk in 2022. From now on we expect interest rates to remain stable and probably start to come down after the summer.', 'Additionally, during the last few years we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally reduce our cost of risk. We have enhanced our cost of profile, the weight of new ventages with the best ratings has increased. We have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower risk, secure portfolios like mortgages, agro or payroll.', 'All in all given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and new lending profile, we expect to remain on target, excluding one of them in 2023, cost of risk should remain stable compared to 2022. Regarding the US, despite the bumpiest start of the year in the country the messages we gave at investor day have not changed. We expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout 2023 but remain below pre pandemic levels.', 'We have actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality, which was supported by a stable, used car prices and better late stage delinquency payments. Our focus in auto at the moment is on quality and profitability over volumes. Moreover, we were able to further increase the share of auto loans funded by deposits.', 'We have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity plays us in a very strong position to face very challenging scenarios. At the end of the quarter, our liquidity buffer, comprising high quality liquid assets, exceeded 300 billion, 97% of which were level 1 assets. Two thirds of this liquidity buffer is in cash, which is equivalent to 20% of our deposit base. Our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements.', 'The group LCR remained in line with year end at 152%, and the NSFR around 120%. The alcohol portfolio represents 6% of total assets, which is below industry average. The duration of the available for sale portfolio is very low and the current market of the whole health to collect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only 2% of our fully loaded CET1 capital.', 'This demonstrates that impact from the change of the value of our bomb portfolio on capital would be very limited even in a very adverse scenario. Customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core markets. These diversified and stable funding structures supported year-on-year growth as deposits rose with positive performances across almost all countries and segments.', 'The quarter-on-quarter decline in deposits balance in the deposit balances is explained by the seasonal drop in CIB clients deposits, while retail remains stable in the quarter. Some customers using savings to prepare mortgages given the rising interest rates in Europe. We have seen some flows from current accounts behind deposits and mutual funds. We have not seen any unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the travels of banks in the US and Europe.', 'In fact, we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in February and March of over 2 billion. Regarding capital, we ended the quarter at 12.2%. Let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter. 24 basis points of organic growth, which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter, partially offset by risk-wether as a growth. This includes a negative four basis point impact due to the extraordinary banking tax in Spain.', \"25 basis points drop from shareholder remuneration, which includes the total impact of the second 2022 share-by-back program, 15 basis points, and the accrual of the cash dividend, 10 basis points for the first quarter, taking into account a 50% payout. 11 basis points were related to the update of the regulatory framework, mainly following the EVA's clarification of its interpretation of city-1 minority interest calculation.\", 'And finally, a positive seven basis points from markets, basically available for sale. So we have increased our fully loaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, improved from book Rorwa to 2.8%, continued asset rotation, and increased the percentage of risk-wethered assets which deliver returns above the cost of equity.', 'All in all, a disciplined capital allocation, which combined with our model, gives us confidence in the sustainability of our commitment to remuneration to our shareholders. Now, I will hand it back to our CEO for the conclusions. Thank you. Thank you, Jose. To conclude the presentation and open the Q&A, I will briefly outline some final remarks the Arbition for the coming quarters.', 'Growth in customer volumes, robust revenue performance, double digit NII growth through even deposited sensitivity to ration rates in most countries, and customer margin management. Fee income grew at high single digits driven by our CIV payments and payment businesses. We expect this trend to continue the coming quarters, mainly in Europe and Mexico.', 'We are implementing our one transformation plan, our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and foster process automation and simplification supporting our efficiency improvements. We will accelerate one transformation further in the coming quarters. We have already identified business opportunities across a group which will enable us to maintain strong global and not-gror businesses revenue.', 'Finally, we have a solid balance sheet in sensor liquidity, solvency, and risk profile which will remain focused on maintaining a medium, low risk profile, and in capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio. So as we embark on our new strategy phase, all this plan should increase revenue and improve efficiency and profitability of our banks. With the overall aim of supporting circular de-ballucuation and sustainability in profitability.', 'As previous explained, our standing results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our 23 financial targets. However, we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated, depending on the evolution of the macro environment. We are convinced that we are going to achieve our 15%-rotate target, but probably through a higher contribution from Europe and Mexico and a potential global contribution from the US.', 'Finally, we are also optimistic regarding our medium-term targets that we announced at the investor day. As I told our shareholders at the annual general meeting, these targets are as specific and visions and achievable. We have the vision of what we want to go and the right strategy together. And we have the best team in place to put it in motion. So I am convinced that we will progress quarter by quarter to achieve our targets. Thank you very much. Thank you Jose Nektor.', 'We can start the Q&A session now. If you wish to ask the question, please press star 5 on your telephone. We already have the first question from Ignacio Largo from BNP Paribá. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two questions. The first one is on the outlook at group level for NII and fees. If I just look to one queue, you have met the guidance provided by the bank in investor day and for 2023 of double-g each revenue growth.', 'So as the year goes by, I think that that target gets challenged a bit. So I wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on where should we particularly on NII, where should see the acceleration coming. And based on the comments that you made at the Nektor, a bit of what would be the outlook for the US and III after the performance of the first quarter. The second one is on cost of risk. Have seen a decline in MPLs in Brazil.', \"Just wanted to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here in Brazil and whether we have seen a big NPL or it's just an assistile effect. Thank you. Okay. Hello, Ignacio. Thank you very much for your question. First of all, Assay basically this cost is quite important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we set at the investor day and also our guidance given that with the combination that the group is giving you. Okay.\", \"Assay is basically set. We're going to be a little lower in Brazil and the US and we will be much better in Europe and in Mexico. So it's quite important to understand exactly the combination and the work we manage in the group to get to the levels that we want. Okay. So Europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full 2000 and 23. Okay. Mexico should be up what we call low double digit. Okay.\", 'And we expect also, as I said, we can performance in a time with the exception of Mexico, the US and the DCB. The US is down mid single digits. DCB will be low single digits decline and Brazil is basically mid single digits growth back ended and we expect improvements towards the second half of the end towards the end of the year. Okay. On the cost of risk, I will have Jose basically give you some ideas. Yeah. I may compliment the NII in Europe.', \"We have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio obviously because as you know, mortgage is repriced every 12 months. So we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in Spain. Again, again, they are 12 months, you're either based and in Portugal is six months, you rival based. So we still have again a way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe.\", 'In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in 2023 relative to 2022, excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The 474 million provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-fourth for one-off cases, for specific cases, and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So in that sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean.', \"It excludes one of cases and it reflects the true as a quality evolution of the quarter. So for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of our individuals' portfolios because these are very short-time and obviously they, most of them, have matured already and we have been adding high-quality new ventages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector.\", 'So again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year. Thank you, Jose Nectar. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Francisco Rican, from Alanta. Please go ahead. Yes, hello. So I wanted to ask about following the recent turmoil in the sector. I wonder if you as a management have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk and or if your spectra and your regulatory changes in this front in general.', 'And more specifically, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more. Therefore, in the positive during the quarter, you mentioned season 18CIV, so you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarter and also you can update your guidance in terms of deposit pitas by the end of 2003. You were previously guiding for 25, 30 in Spain or 40, 15 in the UK, 50, about 15 in the US.', 'And just lastly, last question in terms of the alcohol portfolio in Spain, if you have changed your plans, you were aiming for 16 billion on average in 23 in terms of size, you are already above, passing the slides, so you can also update on this. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, I mean, given the turmoil and everything, I mean, the group is actually responding quite well, okay? We have seen all the levels in the deposits, basically, maintained themselves.', \"Individuals probably is the most important part in which 85 to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families, etc., which are basically very solid and very stable, okay? In that regard, also, I mean, with all these times, you always be prudent about how you manage things, but I can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical.\", \"The decrease in deposits was mainly in CIV, as we described, it was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio, and we expect, basically, to get them back and it's in the normal flow of the business, okay? In terms of the retas, I will have José give you a little bit of detail on that. So, back, in the first quarter, we had a drop of around 21 billion in CIV deposits in Europe, but that was seasonal.\", \"If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase, but again, this happens every quarter. This quarter was a bit more, a bit higher than in previous quarters, because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter. So associated, basically, with year-end balance sheet performance. So, this is not recurring, and this is seasonal, but again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits.\", \"We always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter to advantage of that. It's normalizing a bit in the first quarter of the year, but I would expect this seasonal behavior to happen every year. Beat us. Where are we? So, let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a in retail banking, beta today is 6%. Yield average yield is 22 basis points. In CIV, in Spain, European branches and global CIV, beta's are between 80 to 100%.\", 'So in Spain, if you look at the whole of a Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with a beta of 25%. And this is, we guided for the year between 25 to 30. We still, this will hold. Because again, most of the CIV business has already reprised, and we expect a slow increase in the reprising of retail banking. So still within the 25 to 30% for the year. US. Beta is 35%.', \"At the cost of 167, beta is a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher, and very much in line with the average of the system. In the UK, beta is 25%. And in the first quarter, beta's were 30 to 35. We guided to around 50% for the year. So we look at our inter-resensitivity relative to the figures we gave at investor day, very much in line with Europe and the US, and probably a better outlook in the UK. Finally, Alco. Yes, we expected more or less 16 billion average in Spain.\", 'We are already there. We might be a little bit about that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral. Alcoporfolio, we have a negative balance sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So actually buying an Alcoporfolio or rebuilding an Alcoporfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023. It is probably also a matter of 24 and even 2025.', 'So again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities. Thank you, Hector and Jose, and thank you, Paco, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Carlos Pesoto from Keisha Bank, please go ahead. Yes, I am Martin, thank you very much for taking my call. The question is correct.', 'So first question, what would actually be an II, and I am sorry if it is a bit of a recap on previous ones, but I was just wondering if you could give us the help of this for an II and both Brazil and the US. And I was also wondering if you could confirm just make sure that you have a, that there is a total of 210 million euros, one of course of the effects in Brazil and II in the water.', 'And then second question would be actually on on fees, and basically the discussion that we have is in the European level regarding needs and fees, I mean, with potentially rates. And also, if you have some visibility around potential amount of fees that could be impacted by working in this month by being introduced in European level. Thank you very much. Hi Carlos, Pagonia here, sorry to do this to you, but you need to repeat all of your questions.', \"The line was terrible, we couldn't understand the word here. So can you start again, maybe slightly slower and see if it goes better? So trying again, hopefully you'll hear me better. So as I was saying on NII, the question was really on the outlook for the US and Brazil, if you could recap it. And also I was asking to confirm whether it was 210 million euros, positive one off in the Brazilian NII, just to make sure that I got that number right.\", \"And then the second question was on the potential inducement bands in Europe. What type of impacts would such bands would have in fee income for some of them there? Okay, to give you, exactly, how do we see the NII? Okay, exactly the guidance we give is 211. Sorry about that, is that. So Brazil is mid single digit growth, we're talking 8.9 and then the US is 6.1 is down mid single digits, okay, that's exactly the number. Okay, thank you Carlos. Thank you Carlos for your questions.\", 'Can we have the next question please? Next question from Sophie Peterson for JP Morgan, please go ahead. Hi, here is the fee from JP Morgan, thanks for taking my question. I know there has been a lot of questions already on net interest income, but could you give a little bit more details around when you expect net interest income to peak in your core European markets? NII was bloody down in the UK, do you think you have seen peak NII and net interest income?', 'Well, got a lot on a quarterly basis, not improved further. And when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in Spain and when do you expect it to peak in Portugal? Then my second question would be around the cost of deposits in Mexico, they increased almost 1% quarter and quarter. Could you just detail what drew these increased think cost of deposits in Mexico?', \"And then my final question would be on core x with the tier 1, you saw 11 basis points of regulatory capital tailwinds in the first quarter. How should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come and could you give details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come? Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. Okay, really quick. I mean, as Jose was explaining you, in terms of NII, what we see in Europe, we still believe we're going to be.\", \"I mean, the majority of the portfolio will reprise in probably April and May. Okay, so the portfolio is still repressing. Are we going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at that time, probably to the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end. It's also is going to depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that. So in that sense, we'll see that in the UK, we're basically seeing things as stable.\", \"Okay, we basically see that we're still basically building up in the way that the portfolio is being going and also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year. Okay. Also, the terms of what you were talking about growth in the post-its in Mexico, you're right, is still lagging behind. Okay, the growth in costumers in Mexico is starting to pick what is important to do in Mexico, was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients.\", \"Okay, and that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete head to head against our competitors. So in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in Mexico in the following quarters given also the new payrolls that we have contracted. That are coming into the portfolio. Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive and we're also being focused on profitability.\", \"What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintaining our deposit base of individuals while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins. Okay, in terms of capital also, we'd like to comment. Yes, yes, so, Fias, you said we had the Q&A from the EVA was a positive 13 basis points. We had two basis points negative from other updates, model updates and regulatory updates basically in corporate investment banking.\", \"We would expect, I don't know, just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwings from regulatory and models for the rest of the year. Very, very small charges per quarter. In terms of organic capital generation, if you do a simple math in the first quarter, the share buy back corresponds to two quarters and we had the full impact of the Spanish tax, which was four basis points. So the first quarter only corresponded one.\", \"So if you do a, let's say, clean organic capital generation, we generated 10 basis points, 10 to 12 basis points in the quarter, which is what we have always said. We, you know, organically generate 10 to 15 basis points per quarter and that's what we expect for the rest of the year. Thank you and thank you so if you have any questions, can we have the next question please? Next question from Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\", \"I've got one in the US on wine and Spain. The wine in the US is if you can elaborate a little bit on the coastal risk drivers in the future, breaking it down between probability of default, loss given default. What kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increase in installments on the auto business in particular for clients? That gives you comfort basically that again, provisions are not going to go above a pre-COVID levels.\", \"And the one in Spain is you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between retail corporate and large corporate and what kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments from a customer point of view how pushy, especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of chasing additional remuneration. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Let me explain exactly what's going on in the US.\", \"In terms of coastal risk, we expect the coastal risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit, some of the vintage on 22 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see that normally when you see customers in those vintage, this started to get the link for more than 90 days. Usually we repossess between 90 and 95% of the autos.\", \"What's been happening and it's been quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going the link went beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us, restructuring and start paying us back. So we have seen a decrease of reposs from around 90 to 95% or around 59 to 60%. That's basically 30 points. That's why you see the cost of risk is getting much better in the US.\", \"To your question, basically, of going back to pre-covid levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio. We have a lot more in-soup prime and deep-soup prime. Today we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and near prime in the business. That's why the portfolio is never going to go back to the level-sale hat. Also, in 19, we have bluestem. If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in 2021.\", \"That was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk. That's another part of that portfolio is actually much better because of that. In that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the US, even though it's normalizing because it's going back to pre-covid levels, it's not going to be as that that is used to be, but it's much better than we expected at the beginning to conclude. In terms of the break down in deposits, I don't know how soon you would like to... Spain?\", \"In Spain, the Spanish business, we have 246 billion in deposits. Individuals and SMEs is 229 billion, corporate clients, 18 billion. When we look at the public perimeter, that includes the branches and CIV in the branches, we have 15 billion and in global corporate investment banking, 38 billion for the total is what you see in the accounts of 300 and 1 billion. Thank you. That's right. Thank you, and thank you, Nacho, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\", \"Hi, thank you for the presentation. Just a couple of questions, because most of the doubts have been cleared. On the UK, we've seen how a cost of the deposit house is starting to accelerate. If you could elaborate a little bit on the structural head, and when do you foresee the peak net interesting? Because you've said this year is going to be more of a flatish NII if I understood correctly.\", \"Does it mean that we still have to see the benefits of the structural head going forward in 24 and 25 or how do you expect NII to combine competitive dynamics and the structural head upside? The second one, if you could just explain a little bit better, what was this change in the EBA criteria to have that positive impact on capital? Just understand the rational. Thank you very much. OK, I'll take the two of them. Let me answer the second one first, which is CC.\", \"What basically the EBA has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate. So obviously if capital is eventually used, let's say Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in ReIS, not in Euros. So before these, the interpretation was that a capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate. And now obviously because the capital will be used in local currency, that doesn't need to be adjusted.\", \"That's a net between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negative in some countries like Mexico, where the currency has appreciated net net 13 basis points. OK, so in the UK, we still have around 100 billion structural positions, which will help NII going forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year, more or less, around 5%. So volumes a bit down in the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates. And we still think rates might go up a little bit.\", \"So we would expect NII to go up, meet single digits, probably a bit more than meet single digits. So that's the expectation for this year in the UK. Thank you Carlos. Thank you Carlos for your questions. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from City. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the NII from your Euro balance sheet.\", 'The problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult to track your NII performance. And compare it with your peers. So you guided at the capital markets day that you would make 1.7 billion of extra NII in the Euro balance sheet this year with a curve at the time. Could you please update that number today and how it breaks down between Spain, the corporate center, the digital bank, all their Europe and Portugal.', 'The second question is on the US deposit. That was one of your expanding your deposit base was one of the pillars of your plans and possibility there. That is now becoming more and more expensive. Where do you see the cost of deposits in the US by year end? And what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able to raise the deposits without having to pay much more than your competition?', \"And just a quick one, if you could update us on the UK or what do you see for mortgage margins please. Thank you. I'll take the first one. Marta, I will get back to you with a breakdown. Basically, it's all a Euro balance sheet. It's not that difficult to do the sensitivity, but I will get back to you. The sensitivity remains the same. Remember we said 1.7 billion using the forward curve rates as of December. In the first quarter, the curves have remained.\", 'After having moved up and down, they are basically where they were at the end of December. So we would still expect, for the next 12 months, a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter. And in line with that guidance we gave, because as Ektor explained, we would see the reprecation of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year. Thank you, Jose. Okay, let me tell you, Marta, about the US deposits.', 'The US basically accumulated beta has reached around 35%, and the cost is around 1.67%. Okay? The high interest rates reflected on the saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits. What I can tell you is the majority of the deposits in the US basically is individuals. The bulk of them. And they have proven themselves very stable. We have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side.', \"We have seen a little bit of movements in the mid-corporate, which we are basically diversifying the deposits, but nothing material in that sense. Okay, what is important to tell you is that we don't foresee really high increases on that. I mean, there is a lot of competition in the market, but our deposit base has been even with this situation maintained itself very stable.\", \"So we don't foresee that we're going to have a huge increase even with a competition from some others, players that we have seen in the market. And we are not changing our assumptions at this time in the way we see the deposits in the US. Okay? The final question is UK mortgage margins. Yeah, the margins for that specific business are under pressure. We would expect a slightly weaker margins in the mortgage business going forward.\", 'We are, right now we have a market share of 11.3% when we look at stock mortgages in the UK, but when you look at the first quarter, we have originated on average around 6 or 7% of the market because we are focusing on only on high quality mortgages that obviously have a slightly lower margins. But again, the combination of all our structural position volume growth and margin management in the UK should lead to me to highest single digits in NII in 2023.', 'Thank you and thank you, Marta, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Andrea Friedtri from Mediwanka, please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I have one question and two quick clarifications. The first is essentially if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided and we just very basically add up to the end of the year, we would reach 11 billion profits in 2023 when consensus is well below that.', \"Where do you see consensus being too conservative on the estimates for 2023? And the two clarifications, the first is on Brazilian Costa Rizca. You indicated a flatish evolution excluding one of us. I just want to make sure I understood correctly that the 424 million charged on provisions of this quarter is not a one-off. And so the guidance you're giving is 4.4 to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023. The second is again, the guidance you have given before.\", \"I didn't understand if it was related to NII growth or volumes when you said Mexico, up double digit, US, down, mid single digit and Brazil, up, low single digit. Thank you. OK, so let me take consensus and Costa Rizca in Brazil and I will try to clarify that. What is consensus below where we think we might be? I think we are a bit more constructive on fees and I think the first quarter shows very good performance of fees, basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses.\", \"You've seen in the presentation that our global businesses, CIB, with management, PaganEx, are doing very, very well. Also cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 105 in the first quarter. Probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So those I think are the two, this is a bit on NII but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So generally I think it's provisions and fees. Cost of risk in Brazil.\", \"So the 474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in Brazil around one fourth of that for one of cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in Brazil. So the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs for specific cases.\", \"From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 1375 until after the summer, probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector. But by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with 2022, excluding the one-off, which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think that clarifies my comments.\", 'And then on Mexico? Yeah, on Mexico I can tell you is that you are going to see very good growth in terms of NII because of your positive in the sensitivity there. Also what you are going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees because we are growing clients in a very good way. Mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers. Also CIV is an important driver of fees. And also you are going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much under control.', 'So you are going to see an only not very good performance in the country, given that particular situation and also that economic situation in the country is doing very well. Thank you and thank you Andrea for your questions. Can we have the next question please? Yes, I have a question from Beatrice Smith from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi there. Good morning. I have got a couple of questions on the deposit development in Spain that decline.', 'Can you maybe split the trends between corporate and retail deposits there? And also a question of what are the costs of deposits in Spain? There was quite a meaningful increase Q on Q. Do you swap any of your deposit base and is that included in the number? And then lastly of course there was also loan-hield expansion regarding the management of your net interest income in Spain. Do you look more at the customer spread or do you look at the individual costing of the balance sheet?', \"And then a couple of follow-ups on Brazil could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one of those around 460, 470 basis points are things. Another question on the Polish FX saga. Do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish spring more gorgeous? And lastly one question on the regulatory outlook. Do you expect there to be any rethink other in Spain or on a global level of deposit insurance charges and the funding of deposit insurance funds? Thank you.\", \"Okay. So the deposits in Spain, as I said, 21, 22 billion drop from corporate deposits, flat, slightly down retail deposits in the quarter. Basically when you look at early mortgage repayments, they are very much aligned. So Annie, we look at February and March, as I mentioned, positive trends in both retail and corporate deposits because again, the 21 billion drop was associated with the year and balance sheets of our corporate deposits. I'm not sure I understood your second question well.\", \"Your question was if we swap deposits or... No, we don't. Obviously, no, no, we don't swap the deposits. We manage net interest income, sorry, interest risk through the asset side, not through the liability side. How do we manage NIA if I understand correctly? Do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that?\", \"I don't understand where your question, but obviously again, interest rate risk management is mostly managed through the asset side and we look at the overall net interest margin of our interest earnings assets. Brazil, the cost of risk... Basically, it's around 4.58 percent and excluding the one of that we had, okay? And that's... And in terms of the mortgages that you ask for Poland, up to now, the portfolio basically is 48 percent reserved, okay?\", \"That's exactly and we are actually looking at what we're going to do depending on how the portfolio evolves, okay? And we are now 48 percent coverage of the total portfolio. Thank you and thank you, Bridget, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, very quickly, hopefully. Two questions for me on provisions on the US.\", \"I know you touched on an earlier question on it, but I just wanted to understand the car price is so far being better, it's certainly year to date. And if you look at your surgesization data, that's also doing slightly better in the MPLs or down. So why didn't the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter didn't go down as much? Is there a lag effect here? How quickly do the second hand car prices feed into the model? Maybe some hand holding there.\", \"And I don't know if you could be more specific on your updated views for a year, cost of risk in the US. And on Brazil, I don't know if you've touched on this, but should we expect any more top ups or one-offs in Brazil beyond the recurrent cost of risk that you will rate touched on? Thanks. Alvaro, in the provisions on the US, okay, it's very important that you understand that. I already explained exactly how the vintage is performing.\", \"The previous vintage is basically performing quite well, okay? The thing is, there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS, okay?\", \"IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of the fault that was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in the US because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? When you turn that portfolio to IFRS, the NOV, the new definition of the fault basically requires you to create a lot more provisions, even though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly because it's quite complicated.\", \"So what I'm trying to tell you that IFRS does not pre-be, I mean, sees that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs, okay? So normally, a portfolio in Europe, beyond 90 days, etc., would be, I mean, would go for reposition.\", \"A portfolio in the US is not performing exactly like that, is actually, beyond 90 days is performing much better and the client might pay you one installment, two installments, then would pay you not to pay you one installment and there would pay again, etc., okay? So that's why you see those differences and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though you write car prices are better than much better than we expected and the mind-hime is actually at better levels.\", \"At the end cost of risk in the US is going to be around 2%. Okay? It's exactly what we think. And in terms of, yeah, 3% compared with pre-pandemic, all right? So as we were saying, it will gradually normalize, but it is actually performing a little bit better this year and it will not reach pre-pandemic levels because of the change in the mix that the director was referring to. But this year we would expect it to be around 2%. Okay.\", \"And in terms of Brazil is exactly Alvaro as José Jose is playing you. It's in Brazil at around 13.75%. Okay? Inflation is actually just below 7%. What José was explaining you, if the rates continue to be that way, there might be the possibility that some of the big corporates or medium-sized corporates start to suffer. Okay? We don't see that individual portfolio with suffer because it's shorter term, it's managing a different well and is a little bit inelastic to the rates.\", 'But the corporate portfolio in the mid-corporates mainly and SMEs could suffer because of that. But at the same time, individuals is improving and you can see that actually in the first quarter cost of risk isolated at 4.4% because we are growing in high quality retail loans and the old ventages are maturing very, very quickly.', \"So even with that possible and we don't know, but it might happen possible deterioration in the cost of risk in the corporate sector, we would still expect to be in line with a guideline that we gave at investor day for a flat cost of risk year-on-year excluding one-offs. And no, the answer is no, we don't expect any significant one-offs for the rest of the year. Thank you. And thank you, Alvaro, for your questions. Can we have the last question, please?\", \"Next question from Fernando Gil de Santibanes from Best Inversocurities, please go ahead. All right. Thank you very much. We'll take you in my question. Just to quickly go in on liquidity and LCR ratios. How do you see the year in LCR ratios at a group level, Spain, Portugal and the U.S. States? And can you please remind us of the TLTR or Materials that have been passed? Thank you very much. TLTR or? No, okay. So, no, the LCRs. Very difficult to predict.\", 'Around 130 to 140 in every unit at least. For the group, it might be a bit higher than that because of the liquidity of the corporate center. But when we look at specific units, 130 or above. TLTR or we have 25 billion left. So we have rebate 65 billion. This 25 billion will mature gradually until 2024. The 25 billion, 4 billion in Santa and Spain, 18 billion in Santa and their consumer finance and 3 billion in Portugal. Thank you. And thank you for your questions.', 'Thank you all for your attendance. Santa and their investor relations team. Is it your disposal for any and all questions that you may have? Thank you, everybody. Thank you.'], [\"Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year.\", 'Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website.', 'But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us.', \"First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, José will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion.\", \"That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions.\", 'We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain.', 'Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion.', 'If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom.', 'Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected.', 'Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate.', 'Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year.', 'The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024.', \"As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains.\", 'Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022.', 'This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth.', 'From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively.', 'In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends.', \"In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy.\", 'At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year.', 'While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months.', 'Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail.', 'We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight.', 'First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group.', \"The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online.\", 'We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US.', 'Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment.', 'Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas.', 'The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control.', 'We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year.', 'Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year.', \"CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability.\", 'As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits.', 'Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries.', 'In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms.', 'As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services.', \"Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform.\", 'We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth.', 'Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation.', 'Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing.', 'Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders.', \"I leave you now with José or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please José. José, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance.\", 'Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina.', 'Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%.', 'So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter.', 'We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year.', 'Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year.', 'Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year.', 'As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing.', 'This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US.', 'We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging.', 'Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher.', 'In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment.', 'This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue.', 'We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter.', 'Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses.', \"We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance.\", 'Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer.', 'Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation.', 'By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years.', \"Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries.\", \"Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels.\", 'Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels.', 'Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout.', 'There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity.', 'Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re伎ed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re伎ed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more.', \"That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate.\", 'And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer.', 'Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year.', 'This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025.', \"Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you.\", 'Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it.', 'And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25.', 'So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail.', \"Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see.\", 'I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically José to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments.', 'With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging.', 'We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters.', 'The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage.', \"It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves.\", 'This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect.', \"Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag.\", 'So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good.', \"We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect.\", \"I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail.\", \"Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds.\", 'Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well.', 'For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account.', \"It's very important to understand what the model changes about.\", \"The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho.\", 'Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter.', 'We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end.', \"Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions.\", \"Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I.\", 'If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you.', \"Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask José to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina.\", \"In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points.\", \"And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead.\", \"Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks.\", \"First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits.\", \"Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please.\", \"There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead.\", \"Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.\", \"Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates.\", 'Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you.', \"Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye you\"], [\"Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first half of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektor Grisi, and our steer for Mr. José García Candera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for all and any questions you may have in the Q&A session.\", \"If you would like to ask a question, please press star 5 on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Ektor, the floor is yours. Thank you, Reganiam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. First, we talk about our H1 results in the context of our strategy. Then José will then review your financial performance in greater detail. And then I will conclude with some final messages.\", 'As Reganiam said, we will then open the floor for your questions. The main highlights of our results in the first half of 2024 are the following. Q2 was another record quarter for Santander, who chose the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reach 3.2 billion, thus 20% above Q2 23, even after the impact of 450 million euros of one-time charges, net of taxes and minorities. In them, recurring profit was 3.7 billion in Q2.', 'Profit in the first half reached 6.1 billion euros, also a record high of 16%, supported by the strong-cost and revenue growth in all regions and global businesses. We continue to accelerate one transformation to become simpler, more automated, and more integrated. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved by 261 basis points to 41.6%, the best in 15 years. And our eternal tangible equity rose 137 basis points to 15.9%, or 16.3 if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain.', 'Finally, our solid balance sheet with a sand capital ratio, solid credit quality and a street capital discipline helped us reach strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation with TNAF plus dividend per share increasing 12%. Let us stop for a moment in our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them.', 'With that quarter, we have reported variation in constant euros in all countries, except Argentina, which is shown in current euros to mitigate the distortions from hyperinflation. In Q2, we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects. Although it has little impact when comparing half years, distortions are more significant when we compare with Q1.', 'Our opinion is strong from top to bottom. Revenue was all-time high with record NII and fees supported by all global businesses and regions. Second, expenses increased below inflation and below revenue on good cost management. And cost has been stable for four quarters in a row. Third, we have reported net operating income growing double digit for nine consecutive quarters demonstrating the sustainability of our results. Fourth, long-lost provisions continue to normalize as expected.', 'The highest profit ever, as I mentioned before, was achieved even after one-time charges. These were 210 additional Swiss mortgage provision in Poland reaching coverage of 100%. 240 million from the write-down of our matching platform in Germany and super digital in Latin America that I will explain in more detail later on. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-offs impact in Brazil, which do not affect profit and have been netted in the underlying PNL.', 'This, as you can see, is a strong first half of the year with solid commercial and business dynamics that already puts us ahead of our plan for 2024. As a result, we have upgraded some of our targets for the year. We have increased our revenue growth target to high single digit with better NII and fee income. We have improved our efficiency ratio target to around 42% as accelerating one transformation leads to higher operational leverage.', 'And we have raised our road to target to about 16% versus the previous 16%. We are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year. Cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around 1.2% on active risk management and strong labor markets. As a reference, year to day cost of risk was 1.17% even with additional provisions that I just described in Poland.', 'In capital, our city one ratio ended June at 12.5%, with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above 12%, even after the Basel III implementation. One transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind our record performance, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes plus our active spread management have already contributed 266 basis points of efficiencies since we started.', \"Our global businesses continue to push a group's profitability and have delivered 87 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 71 basis points in efficiencies so far. As we have often said, we are going back to basics, which supports value creation based on profitable growth. How? By focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience. And by obtaining the operational leverage from a global platforms and come on tech.\", 'This is reflected in the performance of our global businesses. A retail and consumer business as efficiency ratio improved by 480 basis points and 270 basis points respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business. Leveraging our expertise to grow in the US maintaining a risk profile. We have seen new growth 6% another record supported by the strong performance and client flows in the US.', 'Wealth continued is a strong growth improving efficiency and profitability and in payments where we manage over 100 million cards in the group we have significantly improved profitability. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year we had a one-time fee from a commercial agreement in Brazil excluding this impact, payments revenue would be 6% up and efficiency would have improved by 113 basis points even after investing in the global platforms.', \"In the coming five slides, I will review the advances on each of our global businesses. Let's start with retail. We are working to become the number one bank for customers. It is a great example of the benefits from one transformation. Innovation helps to offer the best customer experience. In Mexico, for example, our new digital processes helped onboarding time and led to our record 90,000 digital account openings just last month.\", 'A common operating model across our banks, automation and digitalization free some time of our people to focus on commercial activities. The education of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped 8%. Versus last year. Deployment of our global platform has continued. In the US, it has been successfully completed. Within the group, gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Mexico, Brazil and Chile.', \"And it is processing a number of transactions that is around 20% higher year-on-year. Financial, we are extracting the potential from today's favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our diversification. We carefully manage margins in the higher for longer rate environment in Europe and keep capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in South America. And while we achieve a strong operational leverage across the group.\", 'As a result, our profit grew 35% year-on-year, rate of 430 basis points to 18.1 on the back of revenue of double digit on good performance of NIIAM fees with all regions growing, especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 4% in real terms reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels. In consumer, we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers.', \"Our best in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, last year we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct out-of-players, which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their out-of-finance online and to end in very little time. We are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase NII stability and autonomous funding across the interest rate cycle. The deposits were 14% year-on-year supported by our digital solutions.\", \"We expect positive trends to continue, helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. In checkout lending, we recently launched stalled-man's loans with Apple in Germany through SINIA, which we are looking to spend to other European countries.\", 'We have a great quarter-on-its operational leverage, which resulted in double-deget growth in net operating income and a 4% profit increase in H1. With number one, strong revenue, driven by positive commercial dynamics with higher volumes, mainly in Europe or Brazil, good and AI performance and 27% fee growth from insurance. Number two, cost-falling 3% in real terms on the execution of our strategic and efficiency plans executed last year.', 'And third, higher provisions mainly Swiss-Franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in Europe and the US. Volume and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that consumer will end 24 with a profit growth of around double-deget even after the normalization of provisions. We are building a work-class CAB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile.', 'We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions. Our collaboration in the US with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts. For example, we made our first corporate share buy back for a US company. And we were appointed global coordinator for a US listed IPO for the first time ever.', 'In Mexico, we are creating a significant partnership within the Mexico-US corridor leveraging our global markets and US bank built-out initiatives. And these are just a few examples from a long list. As a result, revenue in the CAB in the US rose 33% year-on-year. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our US banking build-out initiative which will become even more evident in the coming quarters.', 'We continue to spend and strengthen our centers of expertise including key industry groups such as chemicals, technology, and paper and packaging. Our CAB business is capital-wide very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good-paced year-on-year. Our active capital management continues to support great trade-off and high profitability levels.', 'In essence, CAB had great results, increasing revenue in H1 6% year-on-year even after our record first half in 23, making H1 the best ever with fees growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows. Moving on to wealth management and insurance, we continue to build the best bank private bank and insurance van er in Europe and the Americas.', 'Now, number one, by improving customer relationships through the best service and raise solutions resulting in double digit growth in private banking customers. Second, collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CAB, which is a major driver for growth and allows us to capture net-bought-brand feeds. Collaboration fees increased by 12% year-on-year.', 'Third, developing global platforms across all three businesses and digitalized distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. A good example of this is AutoCompara, our auto insurance comparison engine that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. A Tributable Profit rose double digit on a strong private banking activity.', 'In a favorable interest rate environment, we total fees for all three businesses growing at double digit and cost top slightly in real terms. Finally, efficiency improved 230 basis points year-on-year and Rote rose to 350 basis points to over 80%. Finally, payments where we have a unique positions on both sides of the value chain, one issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-goid and second in merchant acquiring.', \"In merchant, we are the second largest acquiring Latin America and a market leader in Spain and Portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability. We are gaining market share in most markets as we as trends get net's customer value proposition with new global solution, an example is dynamic currency conversion in Mexico, which has helped get net to become second in Mexico with a 20% market share and a 47% EBDA margin in Q2.\", \"We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to Pag-on-X global platform to leverage the group's scale. The transactions managed globally through Pag-on-X payments surpassed one billion per year during the first half of this year with 30% growth quarter-on-quarter. The rollout of PLARV, our global card's platform, is on track. We continue to increase the number of debit cards managing PLARV at a good pace and we're starting the migration of the debit portfolio.\", 'We plan to manage around 15 million cards through PLARV in Brazil by year end. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded one of the charges in Pag-on-X from the right down of investments. One is a discontinuation of our merchant platform in Germany, we announced in June as we are focusing on our current acquiring value proposition in our core markets, where we have a very competitive business.', 'The other one is our decision to write down super digital, a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and maximize operational leverage. These decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business, reducing fixed cost going forward. Excluding these impacts, underlying performance was very positive.', 'Profit in payments was up 30% year-on-year on good revenue performance, cost falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms and sound credit quality in cards. Pag-on-X EBDA margin improved to 20% one of the best among competitors. We expect a consistent execution of our strategy, efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters.', 'Today results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in H1, with double-ease shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter. The quarter was 16.3% of 134 paces points year-on-year reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are re-inni- re-inni-ting new visas. EPS rose to nearly 37 cents, thus around 20% year-on-year and we delivered 12% growth in shareholder value creation.', 'Supported all by strong profit generation are a three-disciplinary capital allocation and sharerival. We have reported around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, returning around 6.5 billion through buybacks and providing a return on investment of 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jose to go into our financial performance in more detail. Please Jose. Thank you, Ector and good morning everyone.', 'Like always, I will go into a bit more detail in the P&L and the capital ratio. But let me start by making some general comments. The first one is that our record profits include, as Ector mentioned, 450 million from one-offs, coming basically from the right downs in Pagonext and additional provisions in the Swiss Frank mortgage portfolio in Poland.', 'We also had a one-off in Brazil related to capital gain from the transaction we announced with Sodexo, but we used that amount to strengthen the balance sheet, so no impact on the bottom line.', 'But if these results, as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage, with very positive momentum both in Europe and in Latin America at the same time, revenue grew 9% with the highest 10 AI and fee income in our history, and costs were down slightly in real terms as a result operating income was up 14%. The returns increased even after including the 200 million increase in Swiss Frank provisions that we took in the quote.', \"On the right hand side, you can see the about training profit quarter on quarter at 12%, which was driven by a top-line growth with lower cost and provisions fairly flat, as I just mentioned. Let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why we're starting to use a new inflation adjusted exchange rate in Argentina, rather than the official one.\", 'We have observed the significant divergence between the official exchange rate and inflation, and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach. The new exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with the differential between the inflation in Argentina and in the US. This is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in Argentina.', 'And this should mitigate the volatility that the currency might experience in the future, as you all remember, was the case in 2023. Following these accounting rules, we have recorded a full Q1 and Q2 impacts from this adjustment in Q2, which does not significantly affect the year-on-year figures, but it has significant impact and causes some distortions when we look at quarter and quarter. And I will try to show these differences in the coming slides.', 'For instance, NII is dropping, is down 4% in the quarter, but if we exclude Argentina, the groups in NII would have gone up 2%. Since similar happens with fees, instead of decreasing in the quarter, increasing 1%, they would have increased 3%, and cause would have been fairly flat. If this exchange rate does not materialize, we would revert this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today.', 'It looks to us that this is a prudent, more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in Argentina. There was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue.', 'This strong growth was primarily supported by retail, retail accounts, you know, for more than 50% of our businesses, and is growing at double digits with very good performance in NII across regions and fees also growing, especially in the Americas, and also consumer, which is reaching good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong growth in Europe and Latin.', 'Corporate investment banking also had a good quarter, a revenue reach in all time high, both in the quarter and in the first half of the year, particularly in Spain, in the US and in Mexico. Also double digit growth in wealth, as mentioned, as sector mentioned, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payments also perform very well, particularly we exclude the one time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of 23 years.', \"You remember which we explained, and the sector just mentioned, where we had a one-off from an agreement with MasterCard. And finally, the corporate center's high liquidity buffer remuneration was upset by higher telecom rail issuances and the negative impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued to increase in the quarter if we exclude Argentina, particularly driven by retail, consumer and CIV, which represented 95% of groups in NII.\", 'On the slide, you can see that we are in this small box in red, putting the figure that we would have recorded if we had used the official Argentina exchange rate. So this is important, keep this in mind, and to show again that we have decided to do is a prudent account of our profits coming from Argentina.', 'NII rose 11% year-on-year, supported by all businesses and regions, on the back of very active price management in retail Europe, especially in deposits, also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, in consumer South America, in retail South America, in consumer, sorry, which is now very evident in Brazil, especially in Brazil and Chile, and very good levels of activity in corporate investment banking.', \"In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, explained by higher yield assets as we continue reprising our books, but also very good management of the positive costs, which basically outweated the pressures that we are seeing. It's true that the margin is expanding, as you can see, if we exclude Argentina, or if we had used the official exchange rate, so overall the margin management, pricing management on both the asset side and liability side is really strong.\", \"We see a slight deterioration though if we use our official exchange rate or our adjusted exchange rate, although it's not very significant in the quarter, going forward, we would expect some marginal, margin pressure in Europe that will be more than compensated by positive contribution from the Americas and our consumer business.\", 'In the context of low-fee growth in general across the sector, as a result of sub-dute loan demand, we generated another record quarter in FINCAM at 6.5 billion euros, with solid growth all across the five businesses, retail increase 3%, basically driven by Brazil, North American, Poland, outstanding performance in consumer, on the back of very strong insurance businesses.', 'Corporate investment banking also grew from already at very high levels in the first quarter, in the first half of last year, especially in the US, wealth supported by very strong private banking activity, and payments that, as we mentioned, was affected by the one time fee recorded in Brazil last year.', 'Structural efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter after quarter, most income was 41.6%, the best level that we have reported for the last 15 years, and one of the best in the sector, is already better than the levels that we guided for 2024.', \"Cost declined, quarter and quarter, we're very flattish if we exclude Argentina, after having been stable for the last three quarters, we've revenue growing steadily quarter after quarter, improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have in the second half of the year and in 2025. Abrage inflation continued its gradual decline down from 12% a year ago to below 4% this quarter.\", 'In this context, cost fell 1% in real terms year and year, despite that, as you all know, we have some lack of effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs, and our investments in transformation.', \"By businesses, cost remain well under control in retail, consumer and payments, we've represented, we've represented 80% of our cost base, and 80% of the increase, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, came from CIB, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our corporate investment banking franchise. In fact, if we exclude this investment, cost in the rest of the group, would have decreased 3% in real terms.\", 'The equality remained very much under control, obviously supported by stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group. Cost of risk was 1.21%. Remember that we look at the last 12 months. If we look at the first half of the year, cost of risk was 1.17%. And including the increase in the provisions for the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Argentina. So we are very much on target to reach the 1.2% for the year, and we reiterate that target.', 'In the second half, we expect that trends in consumer and Mexico will be closer to more normalized levels, but this will be offset by a better performance in retail Europe and South America. Turning to capital and closing my section here, our city one ratio remains at a very comfortable level, backed by strong organic capital generation and significant risk weighted asset rotation.', 'This quarter we generated 52 basis points organically, supported by our asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic risk weighted asset growth. We recorded 25 basis points charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. And finally, there was a seven basis point negative impact mainly related to intangibles, the valuation of available for sale portfolios and others. There were not significant regulatory impacts in the quarter.', 'We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulted in a new book, Return on Risk Weighted Assets, of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our backbook at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims at optimizing capital deployment, is achieving outstanding results.', 'The first half, we disposed of an amount of capital equivalent of 30 billion in risk weighted assets, at the cost of capital of half of that of the new originations. In addition, the one third of our balance sheet that materials every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at this Return on Tangeable Equity of 23%. The combination of these actions explain the expanding profitability and increasing capital ratio. Let me turn it now back to actor for his conclusions.', 'Thank you Jose. As our results clearly show, we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025 in our last investor day. Thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy. With the strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to about 16%. By growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 12% value creation to our shareholders.', 'We set it in our investor day and I want to remind you again, we have entered a new phase of value creation for our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident. The strong growth in revenue with flatish cost and around 20% growth in EPS. And the first ever H1 profit with all time high NII fees and et operating income backed by strong performance in our businesses and regions.', \"Sustained progress in our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both high revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we expect to exceed some of our targets for 24. We are upgrading our revenue growth target to high single digits.\", 'Efficiency to run 42%. And as we deployed capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, we are improving our profitability target to above 16%. Our focus at Santander is to be reliable in providing returns that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value consistently and through the cycle based on both business and your graphic diversification.', 'The progress of the last 10 years to simplify an aligned model in all our businesses and now deploy your own tech stack is already evident and now depends on execution to continue to deliver on our primary target of double digit TNAF plus DPS growth through the cycle. And now we will be happy to take all your questions. Thank you. Thank you Jose Nector. We can start the Q&A session now please. Thank you. If you wish to ask the question, please press a style 5 on the telephone.', 'We already have our first question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, this is the P from taking organ. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question would be on the risk transfers. Did I hear correctly that you saw 30 billion of risk-graded asset disposal in the quarter? And maybe you could just talk about the decline in risk-graded assets. I see risk-graded assets, especially in Spain, were down around 2% quarter and quarter.', 'In digital consumer bank minus 1% quarter and quarter, but in both entities, the loan grew by 3% quarter and quarter. So how should we think about these SRTs or securitization and what will be the revenue in best going forward from securitizing some of the loans. And also related to that, if you could just remind us on the regulatory gap ahead when coming in the second half. Then my second question would be on e-berry.', \"There has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you're looking to potentially IPO e-berry. Can you just remind us what the tangible book value for a share is for the tangible book value for these businesses, how much revenue do you get from e-berry and what your kind of plans for e-berries? Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. I mean, first of all, our policy basically has been as Jose was explaining in detail to rotate the balance sheet as much as we can.\", \"This is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to re-inate assets. So this is basically helping us to rotate. And also giving us a new, basically I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something, we basically reuse that capital, already deploy the capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way.\", \"As Jose was explaining to you, we rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on profitability, we're actually re-investing better and better. And that's actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank. Then Jose can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory charges, et cetera.\", \"So we continue to basically hang on to that number. 12% above 12% will be, and as we, and as I said, and Jose basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well. And in terms of the IPO of E-VII, we'll give you the details, Jose will give you the details on that. Thank you Jose. Hi, Sophie. First of all, the 30 billion was re-sweeted as it's in the first half.\", 'So more or less 40% of these is SRTs, but the rest is all the types of transactions, like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this 30 billion was around in-rote equivalent. We always look at Rorwa, but just to use the same currency everywhere in-rote equivalent, the cost of mobilizing this 30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on this 30 billion in res-wated assets.', \"So in-rote equivalent, this 30 billion is close to 4 billion in capital times this 13%. So on an analyzed basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around 500 million. We expect to continue doing this. The man-for-private credit is significant. We have a very busy second half of the year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera. But we expect to mobilize much more than last year.\", \"And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital hell wings this year. We still expect 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Ektor mentioned, fully loaded. And when we mentioned fully loaded, it's fully loaded, even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will be comfortably above 12%. And the day one impacts will be very relatively small as we mentioned before.\", \"And in the case of Avery, we are always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there were some news that we are contemplated on IPO in Avery. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital. This is one of them that doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again, this will be put as one of our several capital managed many initiatives that we have across the group. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?\", 'Next question from Ignacio Larghi from BNP Paripa. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is on the revenue performance. We have seen a very good performance in Europe. Probably a bit better than what we expected, at least I expect the other beginning of the year. A lot of them has been lagging a bit behind with their field being softer. How should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half?', \"When you have upgraded the revenue guidance to rising the digit from the 9% currently, so we expect second half in line with these levels, kind of getting a bit of a sense whether LATAM should have set the weakness of Europe that you have flagged during the call in margin. And the second question is on the UK, if you could elaborate a bit, what should we expect in terms of NII for the UK? Looks, names, and it's not a lie saying so try to get in your thoughts on the outlook for the UK.\", \"Thank you. Thank you, Ignacio. First of all, let me tell you, as you have said, revenue has been very strong. Much stronger that we believe that the beginning rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different businesses. As you know, we're very focused on profitability in the way we're structuring things and not basically spaying off. All right. I believe that I mean revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that LATAM has a weakness.\", \"I see that actually LATAM is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can see also very good results coming out of what they're doing in retail in Brazil, okay? Also Chile is doing quite a good performance. Mexico, basically on retail, we're changing the mix and that's why you see the flat, the flat and IE on there, but I mean it will continue to give very good results. So respect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue.\", 'And in that sense, on basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was per a very second half. First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also, some of the strategies have done in terms of betas are paying off, okay? So I believe that all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen.', \"In terms of detail, basically is a more rational behavior as I told you. Fees are not going to be doing that well due to the switcher campaign that was structured and both benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter much better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the UK which are going to make the business perform a much better than we saw.\", \"I don't know, Jose, we'd like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but I think I'm sure that you will ask about NIA. You mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NIA in the Eurozone. We now see NIA in the Eurozone, particularly in Spain, Portugal, etc. Up, mid-single digits, obviously rates are higher for longer. So much better performance in NIA.\", 'We have hatched a substantial amount of our balance sheets in the Eurozone, basically through the alco portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages, and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of RENIA in Europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before. So as Ektor mentioned, we expect fairly stable.', \"Maybe it's slightly down in NIA in Spain in the second half of the year and next year, but at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from South America, Brazil and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future revolution of NIA and revenue in the second half. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Ávaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning.\", \"I asked a couple of follow-ups on just on the question, the comment you've just made around mid-single digit in Spain and I. That implies I think almost 9% production, half on half, which feels a bit substantial. So I don't know if my math is very quickly wrong or if you can add a bit of color on that. And then on the performance and fees in the US, could you give us a bit of color on the obviously very strong performance?\", \"But if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM, DCM, just a performance opinion of how sustainable it is going forward. If I can slip in a third, you've mentioned the over 12% capital, but I thought the target was 12 and a half percent of the end of the year. So can you just go from that to the case and you please should still expect that 2030 based points will be at once. Thank you. Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital.\", \"In capital, we have always said we're going to be above 12%. And that basically has been the guidance we're at 12 and a half right now. And we set as Jose basically rated that we're going to be above 12% even after base of three fully loaded. That's exactly the guidance. In terms of performance in the US, FIS, the majority is basically the CIV. A business, a CIV is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that we're having a little bit also in the US.\", \"But CIV is a main driver. It's been growing. It grew 38% year on year, 1.3% quarter on quarter. As you know, CIV business is cyclical. So we have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well. And also, a very good connection in between what we're doing with the US, as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the business in Europe.\", \"What's happening, and let me explain a little bit, is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of this EM that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, were becoming one. And you see us top three in the league tables right now in Latin America doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates, but also to the governments.\", \"I mean, when UMS did their transaction at the beginning of the year, 7.5 billion, we were one of the principal book runners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the B-forpe that we did in the US. So that's starting to pay off. I believe that with the four teams that we added, I think we're going to complement the rest of the business, have we continue driving fees up, but let's see what happens with the cyclicality of the business.\", 'On the other side, Ristael is also performing well in fees, and we believe that he continues to do so over the rest of the year. In terms of what we give to, in terms of Spain, party performance, loans are starting to reprise lower at the lower rates, but the deposits bet us are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of the deposits.', \"Also as Jose explained, you in detail, alcohol volumes are helping, and the lower cost of the hatching, which were not in place before, are now in place, so it's going to help us. In the United, as Jose said, it's reaching to speak, but I expect the United to world mid-single digit in 24, better performance that we expected at the beginning of the year, and it's also because of the higher for longer rates and environment that we're experiencing.\", \"I don't know if what we would like to add something. In terms of details, I don't know. First half against first half, in the United, Spain is up 15%. So if we grew zero in the second half, the year on year would be around 7%. So I don't understand what you get the minus nine.\", 'If I go quarter on quarter, NIA in Spain was started in the third quarter of last year, 174, fourth quarter 174, first quarter of this year 182, second quarter 184, we would expect the 184 to be the peak, and then slightly down in the second half, probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year, and we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025.', \"In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis points headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year end. The guidance of 12% is post-bassery fully loaded. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from City, please go ahead. Thank you very much. I've got a couple of follow ups in the US. You're still struggling to deliver positive jobs.\", 'When you think things will turn around there, do you think that we will see positive jobs in the second half of the year? In the US as well, your PNL still remains pretty supported by tax credits. Can you help us understand how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters? And then if I may ask, do you think the new reporting is helping investors understand something better? Because judging by your low PE, I think not, so I would like to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.', \"Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain a little bit what's going on in the US. If you look at by business, you're going to see that retail is actually having lower cost than it used to have because of the transformation, even with the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really good cost reduction and we believe we're going to perform better. They just are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIV and CIV as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it.\", \"So if we're going to have a second half that is better, it's going to start looking better but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIV business and some of the still people are coming into the team that will start to come in in the next few months, as you know, there's a period of garden leave, et cetera. But the main reason is the investment we're doing in CIV, which by in any way is not creating a bit investment bank or anything like that.\", \"This is basically, as we said, complementing the rest of the business that we have, our size is not going to be huge, it's a size of a really small boutique, but it's helping us out to be full and to help us in the remainder of the business. And you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact. On terms of the P&L, it's quite easy to understand. The DTAs are basically what we said last year when we started doing the electric vehicles.\", \"I mean, we signed contracts with some OEMs that are generating these DTAs and that's why you see that the P&L is affected by that and it's going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing them in that volume. So we have now three things and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the DTAs in the US. All right? And you're going to see that throughout the year. In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing.\", \"The new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are getting managed in the business on a day-to-day basis, okay? Because it's making us work together. It's making us spend a lot less in the past, for example, and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean, we used to have 11 different apps in 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed. Today is being deployed in all of Europe.\", \"The last deployment we did was a UK and they were deploying Brazil and then we were deploying also the US. So what's happens is basically you use the same around 80-20 and that's the goal that we're basically going through, investing just once and those 80% common, 20% common, 20% cost optimization per each country. So that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way.\", \"We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When the acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two. And you saw the results that I explained. I mean, how EBDA is growing and I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And is just one platform, the one that is being deployed.\", \"Now this platform is being deployed down to Chile. It's in deploy to Argentina and we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way.\", \"Then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they're reporting, I mean, you're going to start getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're managing it, we're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So it's very important that you understand that.\", \"Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB where we are being working together for a long time, the same effects factor is that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the UK are completely the same and is the same product and we just make them once. So that basically tells you how we're going to be able, I mean, how we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19% that I gave you.\", \"So this is exactly the points that we're doing and I believe that it will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and do things in a much cheaper way. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. So two questions for me. The first one is on NII in Brazil.\", 'You still maintain the guidance of growth in the high things for the year. Meetings would imply a quarter and quarter form during the second half if you think this could be the case or not. I mean, because select rates have been expectations of cuts have been pushed out. So you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the NII to select rates in Brazil. And the second question is about NII in the US.', 'We have seen its bottoming out in the second quarter, but they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So if you will need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not, in this context, if you can also comment on the plans to launch open bank, what shall we expect there?', \"Because when I look for example at the digital consumer bank, the deposits are growing there by 20%, but net interest margin is still falling despite the shift to retail deposits. So you can comment also on this NII trends here. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, very strong quarter, up more than 3%, and it's up more than 22% in the year.\", \"What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the changing mix, and lower rates. It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year, by year end, and this ultimately means that NII growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay? Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end of 24.\", \"It's a good performance, I should continue in 25. And let me tell you that, to take the opportunity, that Brazil has delivered a 16% growth rate. I believe that the end of the year should end up between 16 and 17. Strong profitability improvement is not just relying on NII growth, but on the good delivery on fees also. The cost-contention that we have had and expected cost of risk stable during the year.\", \"So I remember you, very optimistic in Brazil, and the ability to continue spending the profitability, as you have seen. In the open bank in the US, open bank will come into the US with the deposit gathering facility towards September, October. We expect that to come. The first phase is the deposit gathering, and I believe it would be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place, and then we'll come and we'll be improving the platform as we see fit.\", 'The first of the deposits, the transactional deposits that SBNA has had remained stable during the year. What you have seen in the post-its in the US is basically the deposits that we have in CIV, which are the ones that we decide on profitability, which is better for us or not. Sometimes because of profitability, we basically let them go, and we move out, we see fit. So there is no problem into that, and we will continue to see that working profitability towards every business that we do.', 'One quick comment on this CB Europe margins and profitability. The new business we wrote in 2021 was extremely profitable. This was post-COVID, and we had historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay, this production is going to stay in our books for three years. So still in our books in 2024, it will gradually disappear between 24 and 25.', 'The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at wroteies of around 20%, ROR was of 2.3 to 4%, which is much, much higher than 22 and 23 annual productions. So you should expect in 2025 a very substantial pickup in profitability in margins and in profitability in consumer Europe because of this in and out of the different productions, and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year following COVID. Thank you, can we have the next question please.', 'This question from Albert of Hernández Garais-Thaval from UBS, please go ahead. Hello, good morning and thanks for checking my questions. I have two. First, we assume you are aiming for the upper end of your ROT target for next year, so that is 17%, which implies a meaningful profit increase in 25 versus 24. So my question is geographically, where is that earnings growth going to come from?', \"And second, related to previous questions, we have seen revenues improving in the US over the last couple of quarters, with volumes up, customer spread, expanding and this coming quite strong. So basically, how sustainable is this revenue pickup going forward? Thanks. Okay, thank you, Albert. Let me start with the US. To tell you, I believe I'm in the US, revenue is going to continue to do pretty well.\", \"Both the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality, in terms of what happens to us in provisions. So what you're going to see is revenue continues to go up, quite fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CAB business. But revenues will be doing fine.\", \"In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions, but we believe, and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions, show us that it coming better. The LTM numbers that we have in provisions for the US are much better than last year. So it's looking well. And so the US shall have a much better year than last year. In terms of the revenue and 17, Jose, if you would like to comment.\", 'Yeah, obviously we expect profitability to continue to increase on the part of increased. Sorry. What I was saying is that we expect our profitability to continue to increase on the back of a higher operational leverage. Our transformation program is delivering very positive jobs that we expect to maintain, particularly in consumer in retail in 2025.', 'The sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NIA in South America, both Brazil and Chile. So definitely operational leverage is what we will continue driving increased profitability. In terms of cost of risk, no signs of deterioration and looking into the next few quarters, we see no signs that we will require to increase our provisions going forward.', 'So if you put all of this together, again, this means that our profits should continue to increase going forward. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Benjamin Conds from RBC. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you both for taking my questions. The first one is on Brazil. He used a 350 million gain to top up your provisioning.', \"I think that's an extra few of adopted before, but how come to lie you that you will need not need to do further top ups in Brazilian cost of risk going forward? Another top up is a catch up or can we assume that the top ups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in Brazil in the coming years? And then secondly in the UK, in the deck you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for 2024.\", 'This suggests that either you do not have any maturity this year, or you pre-hege some of your maturity. If you have been pre-heching, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge matureities have you pre-heached? And what rates did you look in at given the swap rates have been volatile? And do you expect the tailwind from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on NII in the UK in 2025? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let me go to Brazil. Okay.', \"First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provisions is exclusively linked to the long growth that we have in the country. Cost of risk as you have seen is flat quarter on quarter, 4.77 and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand that the recent vintage that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So it's performing better than we expected.\", \"It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain you a little bit. For example, credit cards were in 2021. We were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month. Today we're doing just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base.\", \"The important thing and the big change is exactly that we're not going to be directed to the upper market, which was the one that hurt us quite a lot during 2020, 2021, 23. So that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very focused on profitability and we have been very opportunistic and we use the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point.\", \"And we'll rate the rate at the 24 guidance of delivering its afflatic cost of risk versus 23, okay, including the one of us. So that's what I see in terms of Brazil. In terms of the UK, Jose, please. So as you know, obviously the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits to protect the balance sheet ahead of decreasing interest rates.\", 'Following the recent increase in market rates and in order to protect the NII, we have accelerated the plan investments for 2024 amongst other measures. So the sensitivity we have today is to a hundred percent decrease in parallel decrease in rates in the UK. Today is minus 120 million pounds compared to minus 220 million pounds a year ago. So roughly we have half of the sensitivity today that we had a year ago.', 'The current hedge is a structural hedge is 114 billion pounds compared with 106 billion in December. So this is related to my comment before. With the duration of 2.5 years in December, it was 2.5 years in December, it was 2.4 years and the yield is slightly over 2%. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Carlos Pesoto from Galchabán BPI, please go ahead. The first question will actually be a follow-up in Spain, sorry, on this again.', 'The end is to correctly and the message was that in 2025 NII should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year, where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single-digit growth in 2025. And then my second question will actually be on the US EVs tax rebate that you have been booking. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that, or basically for how long is it in place?', \"Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or something at a state level? And to what extent the potential changes in policy changes in the US could drive that to this period or not, just to have an idea on the time frame for which this is valid right now. Thank you. Thank you Carlos. All right, I mean, I think in the Jose gave a pretty good explanation of what's going on in terms of how do we see no?\", \"Things, it's important to understand what Jose explained to you about what we're doing on the HHS, the alcohol position that we have that will help us throughout the year, even if the rates come down. I think we're probably in the best ever position in that sense. And even as we say, I mean, the NII will slightly come down over the second half, and then we'll see that we will have a pretty good ones towards, let's see how rates basically behave.\", \"But I don't know because if you like to complement, but it's basically. It's exactly what I said. Carlos, it's exactly what you said. I expect NII to go down slightly in the second half of the year, the year-on-year growth 24 against 23 will be somewhere between 5 to 7%. And then next year, NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of the year, which means that NII should be down slightly low single digits. Because again, and this is using the forward rate curves today.\", \"So if this was to change, obviously we would need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for NII in Spain next year. And as I told mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, year and a half. Thank you, Carlos. Okay, on the US, let me go through exactly what happens. First of all, let me tell you that is federal.\", \"We don't know if this is going to be sustained, if there is a change of government in the US or not. I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one. Exactly what happens is every single time we do at least on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank. So what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle. And then we get the cash back or the, sorry, the tax credit. And you show the cross credit in one lumped. Okay, during the month in which we do that.\", \"Right, to be exactly how it goes. So you don't see the impact in the revenue, but the impact you see in the taxes. So that's exactly how it works. I don't know if I'm being correct. I mean, if I'm being clear in one, the way I'm explaining to you this. But it's exactly how it works. So what we have done is that we have a program. What we have signed with the OEMs that we're doing this for. It depends on the also the capacity that we have to absorb those DTAs.\", \"Because this is not, I mean, unlimited. This is not, I mean, we have to have the depends on the balance sheet that we have. We have calculated the numbers exactly that we can absorb. And this is exactly what we negotiate with the OEMs. I know if you understood the question in the right way, but this is exactly how it works. Okay, and we don't know if it's going to happen in the future or not. Hopefully, it continues to be like that. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\", 'Next question from Miruna Kiraya from Jeffrey. Please go ahead. Good morning, doctor. Morning, Jose. Thank you for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow-up please on points we touched on before. Firstly, in the UK, your NIA was slightly out, quarter, quarter in Q2. So just wondering how you see this progressing from here. And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point on NIA?', 'And it should start building from here supported by the H. What is the shape of this into H2 and also into next year? Secondly, just a clarification on your US business. We were talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality? And then lastly, for Brazil, also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business.', \"When do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So as I said in the UK, we see that we're going to have a second half better than the first half. Okay? Market is more rational, both in the margins and in the betas. And on top of that cost, as I said, is going to be slightly better than the first half of the year. Q2 and NIA is showing inside of improvement. Okay?\", \"And as I basically explained, and we see that betas are not going to go up so that basically will help us. In terms of revenue, we see mid to single digit decrease in NIA down mid single digits versus last year. And fees down low double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and the Harry Cashback. You're going to see that is going to be much better in 25 because exactly we're preparing the bank towards that.\", \"Also, we're very focused on profitability. It's very important that you understand that. Okay? We're not using capital below our cost of equity. So we're being very tough on that. That's a society-wide advantage that. And then Jose, I would like to. Sorry, one question. We comment. The mortgage dynamics in the UK seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year. Just as a additional comment. Brazil cost of risk.\", 'We still believe that cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter on quarter, it was a substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at year on year X, the fourth quarter. And we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024. We would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk.', 'So year on year because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter. And then provisions in the US are normalizing cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or slightly below 2%. Thank you. Can we have the last question, please? Last question from Alberto Negro from Medio Banca. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking my question. So I have just a few follow-ups.', 'The first one is on the UK. If you can give us more color on the contribution of the UK structure or edge in the second half of this year and in next year. And the second one is again on Brazil following your comment on the change of the loan mix. Should we expect a normalization of the cost of risk in the next year and see an absolute decline of total provision next year? Thank you.', \"In terms of Brazil, we're changing the loan mix but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the beatages are behaving. So if we see that Brazil basically and we're starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts, its inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down.\", \"We might change the mix again and we might be a little bit more aggressive and I couldn't tell you up at this point what are we going to do because we revised the strategy every single month of what we do and also the pricing. So I don't know what the mix is going to be in Brazil in 25 but I must tell you that we're working in a very dynamic way. We're in a very dynamic market and you need to be on top of it.\", \"So I couldn't tell you at this point but I mean everything basically is and we change the mix to sustain the cost of risk at the reasonable levels and that's the intent that we have in order to manage that. So UK and I think I gave you all the details to calculate that. I gave you the maturity, the rates, the amount and everything else. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, rates this year are expected to stay at 10.5% by year end but to drop significantly next year and that should help.\", 'In addition to the structure of the balance sheet, lower rates next year in Brazil will help not only in terms of NII but also cost of risk. It will be a gradual improvement. We need to see exactly how we will build the business in 2025 in Brazil but definitely lower rates should help. Thank you, Jose. Thank you, actor. And thank you all for your attendance. And if there are any further questions and then that embasser relations team is always at your disposal for anything that you may need.'], [\"I'm going to start with the presentation.

Let's look at how one transformation is delivering results.\", 'Innovation is key, we are enhancing our digital onboarding and promoting simple customer journey and very experiences across the bank. For example, in Brazil we have reduced the onboarding time by 50%, which has contributed to a 3% customer growth only this quarter.

The cash dividend will be 39% higher in 24. And at the same time, since 21, if we include a full amount of the current share-by-backed program, Santa and the recovery purchase will be 12.5% of its outstanding shares.\", 'I leave you now with Jose, who will go in our financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Ector. Let me go into more detail the P&L and the capital. As Ector has mentioned, we are yet again reporting record results. As our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on the back of the highest NII and FIS in our history, and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net operating income with rose 13% year-on-year.', 'Revenue provisions grew only slightly, even after the expected normalization in consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland, we recorded in the second quarter, while cost of risk fell in the quarter. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward training profit, which grew 1% quarter and quarter in euros, 5% in cost in euros, driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions.', 'This quarter there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter and quarter in comparison, but as you can see in the P&L, the impact year and year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter we decided to take a more conservative approach to valuing, to recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina.', 'So we began to apply an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was 1,618 compared to the official exchange rate of 1,069 to the euro. And obviously this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach cost some distortions in the quarter and quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only were relevant.', 'Central revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing, driven by customer revenue growth, which made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which continues to grow close to double digits, with good performance in NIA and fees, especially in the Americas, and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels mainly in global banking and markets.', 'Customer revenue also rose, supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and double digit growth in fees across our geographies. We also delivered double digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, both in private banking and in asset management.', 'Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying performance, as both Pagan-Extra and Cards increased, even more so if we exclude the one-time positive fee recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the corporate center revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from FX Hedgin.', 'Turning to NIA and Net Interest margin, most revenue came from Net Interest income, which increased 9% year-on-year, supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management, particularly in retail in Europe and in consumer, and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South America, in retail South America, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile, and also good activity levels in our global banking business in CIB.', 'NIA was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly driven by retail, where it was up 2%, with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quota, especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes, Poland, due to better spreads and high volumes and the UK supported by good price management. In terms of profitability, we improved our Net Interest margin year-on-year.', 'This is explained by higher yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spread, focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than outweighed higher funding costs. We were able to contain thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive reprise in downwards in South America. As we commented last quarter, we have seen a slight desaleration in Net Interest margin and Net Interest income in line with our expectations.', 'Please remember that the decreasing Net Interest margin in the second quarter was due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, Net Interest margin, was also affected by the hyperinflation accounting in Argentina under the appreciation of the real and the Mexican peso, and to a lesser extent, the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe.', 'Of the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for this new monetary policy. Cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in a good condition, in a good position, to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North America going forward.', 'In an environment of low credit and mounting, we generated another record in FIINCAN, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customers service. Retail increased, as more customers chose and under as the primary financial service provider. We added 5 million new customers of the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers.', 'Outstanding performance in consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe, CIB also grew from record levels last year, especially in the US, on the bank of strong dynamics in global banking. We had a 16% increase in wealth, with all three businesses growing at double digits, and payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the one time positive fee record in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil.', 'Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains. Our cost to income ratio for the 9 month period improved to 41.7%. The best level that we have reported in the last 15 years, one of the best in the sector, and is already at better levels, than the guidance we provided for 2024.', 'Cost declined 1% year-on-year in real terms, despite the lack of effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. My business cost remained very well under control in retail and consumer, which represent 70% of our cost-base. More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as part of strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise.', 'Cost remained containing wealth, even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments, even as we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which helped us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further next year. Credit quality remains robust, around and across our footprint in line with our expectations.', 'We record low unemployment rates in most countries and is in monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected both in the MPL ratio and lower coverage needs. MPL portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%. In our retail and consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quota. In retail, there were sound underlying trends across the different countries.', 'Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the UK and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row and in Mexico, it also declined in the quota following a year of expected normalization. Similarly, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quota to 2.12%.', 'The cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end a year comfortably within our target of 1.2%. Final iteration into capital is a full-loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level back by strong organic capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization.', 'This quota we generated 43 basis points organically, on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation, partially offset by risk weighted asset growth and by minorities. We recorded a 26 basis point charge for Shea Hall remuneration in line with our 50% payout policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios.', 'And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of some dandered Poland and alcohol portfolio valuations, which were offset by impacts on the actions, pensions in the most part, for the most part. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity.', 'Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk weighted assets of 2.9% in the quota, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralize asset management desk, which aims to optimize capital deployment, is achieving outstanding results.', \"In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to 40 billion in risk weighted assets at the cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet that materials every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio. That's all from my side. Ektor back to you. Thank you. Thank you, Jose.\", 'It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for 25 in our last investor day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams. Some city one levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans further improving our profitability to above 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders.', 'In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the back of strong custom revenue with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine months profit ever with all tam high NII, fees and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth.', \"Sustain progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15 years. A rock solid balance sheet and robust quality are contributing to growth and double-deed shareholders value creation.\", 'As a result, we remain on track to exceed the 24 targets we set in January and upgraded last quarter and we are in a great position to continue growing increasing profitability and delivering shareholders value creation.', \"The progress of the last 10 years to simplify an aligned our model in all our businesses and now deployed our own tech stack is already evident and as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on primary target of double digit TNA pressure plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we are very happy to take your questions. Thanks. So thank you, actor. Operator, please let's begin the Q&A session. Please. Thank you.\", \"If you wish to ask a question, please press the star 5 on your telephone. We'll be right half the first question from the 5. Ljolargi from BNP Pariba, please go ahead. Thanks very much. We want everyone and thanks very much for the presentation and for taking the questions I have to if I may. The first one is on NII just to get a bit of a better understanding of the moving parts of the NII during the quarter and also also we expect about the group top line group NII incoming quarters.\", \"The second one would be on course outlook and given the solid performance that we have seen in the quarter, how should we think about course performance going forward and as per horse's comments in the presentation, what kind of improvements do we expect in terms of course to income for 2025. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Let me give it a first key and then I'll host a basically good base, give you another idea. It's interesting to see that if you see NII in constant, you see that is 1% up.\", 'The effect of Argentina is the one that hitting us in the current dures. It is important to explain first of all that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business. This is about 60% of the group balance sheet with some parts showing a really positive sensitivity in Europe and others a negative one like the one we have in Brazil as you already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80 to 90% of the rate exposure.', \"Over the past few quarters we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower rates environments. For example, in the case of Europe we have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In places like Brazil for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the alcohol and also taking some hedges.\", \"You have already seen this year the retail business is operating leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line not just because of high interest rates but also because we're changing the operating model which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate. We're growing customers for example 2.6 million in the third quarter alone and we're keeping cost flat which is quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins.\", \"This is basically a thing that we will continue improving thanks to all first of all the geographical and business identification, the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know how you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost. Yes, definitely thanks. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail.\", 'In June we used an exchange rate of 1499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating and depreciating the exchange rate with inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate as of now is 1069. For the quarter, for the end of the quarter we used 1618 and remember that when you use 1618 inflation accounting you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate. So we have two impacts on our PNL1.', 'There is over 100 million negative quarter and quarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income and in Argentina since it has come down and we have a very liquid balance sheet and is invested mostly in bonds. The yield earn on this bond portfolio is lower and quarter and quarter is over 200 million drop in local currency. You look at local currency there is over 200 million drop in the yield coming from these investments.', 'So Argentina actually explains most of the drop in an interest income, quarter and quarter but also it means around 300 over 300 million impact on total revenue. So as Ektorex explained we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates both in euros and in Brazil which obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe we have been buying and increasing the alcohol portfolio.', 'If we look at the total euro alcohol portfolio we have which is Spain, Portugal and the consumer finance. We have 50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over 6 years and a yield of 3.2, 3.3%. The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities and we also hedge the reprise in our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward starts.', 'So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates. In Brazil we did the opposite. In Brazil we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets.', 'Net net when we look into 2025 for 2024 we see NII down a little bit in current euros but we see NII up in constant euros thanks to these measures that we have discussed and these estimates are based on forward curve rates. Forward rate curves. Thank you Jose. Ignacio in terms of cost is very important that you understand the following. This is not about a cost-coding exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model we are basically introducing in the whole group.', 'It is talking about, I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalogue of products that we have in the group. We have diminished them by almost a third. From 10,000 products we are down to less than 7500 for example. We are changing completely the model we are doing in strong simplification. We are doing a lot of automation but most importantly by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day.', 'So one transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that cost grew less than half of the revenue growth where the living positive jobs are helping to reduce the efficiency to 41.7 which is 2128 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target being at 42 in 24. So we are going to be much better and we believe that we are going to continue that. The new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost.', 'Our ambition is not to lower cost exactly to lower cost in absolute euro-million terms which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate. It is true that costs are up 2.5% but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms costs are down minus 1%. A year or a year.', \"That's a remarkable performance out to the operating leverage with the strong declines that I describe in retail reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment and consumer payments while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow. So the higher cost as Hoss explained reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects.\", \"It's Alia Agreements, Buenos Aires and CIB is the bulk because we are investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and it's actually getting there. So in 2004 efficiency ratio is around 42%, where acknowledged this ratio is already at the level we committed for the 25 ID target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain cost flat but grow the revenue faster.\", \"So our ambition is therefore to do better than initially planned next year in 25 in the cost to income as we describe. So I don't know if that basically answers your questions. Thank you. We can take the next question please. The next question,<|ca|> for the presentation on the key questions. First one is on motor finance business in the UK.\", 'I know that you need time to analyze the recent ruling but I wonder if you can give an indication of how big the provision in needs whether we are talking about hundreds, billions or and also the impact on the business. And my second question is on capital if you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next on the past three impact of fact to 50 basic points on a fully loaded basis other ones have reduced the impact of the recent regulatory updates.', \"So you can also comment on this. Thank you. Thank you Francisco. Okay. First of all let me tell you that I mean as you correctly said is not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling, other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts. This set in any event the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial position. Okay. It's very important. Nor will affect the achievement of the group financial targets for 24.\", \"So if you make the numbers and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16% that basically tells you where do we believe the number is. Okay. So it's very important and I will reiterate that again that you will not change our 24 guidance so that basically gives you a bold park idea or what do we believe the number should be. I don't know Jose, I left something out or I think it's quite clear. Yeah, I think that's perfect. And in terms of why don't you go to the capital thing is.\", \"Yeah, remember that we estimated a supervisory charges to be between 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. We had 18 in the third quarter we still believe that it's going to be you know this 20 to 30 basis points. So this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year and remember since the beginning of the year has been between 1240 to 1250. We add at 1250 in the upper end of the range and we think we could we will close the year more or less at this level.\", \"For next year day one, bus and three impact basically close to zero is like a different slidey positive but it's not going to change much. So day one capital ratio for some time there under bus and three will be more or less the same the same with which we will end 2024 and the fully loaded and when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges.\", \"So fully fully loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points which means that we will be on day one above the 12% that we set as our target, fully loaded capital above 12% on day one fully loaded. Thank you. Thank you, Paco. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Can you hear me? Yeah, I'm sorry. I just had to follow up questions really one on Campbell generation.\", \"So you've given basically a very limited impact the next 10 years which you're already 12 and a half and with the mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate, you're going to generate capital above the 12 and a half you're currently sitting on.\", \"So the question is, as we think about 2526, are you willing to operate in a range of 12 or 13, let's say, or do you expect to grow into that 12 and a half or would you consider sort of increasing any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation. And I apologize to follow up on this and the UK, that's the only explanation in my view why the share price might be down this morning.\", \"You've been quoted Jose saying that's less than 600 million and I understand it's not an impact for 2024 but it might be an impact beyond that. So any details you can give us on the book, if it's new cars, the size of the book or any details that make you confident that we're looking at a relatively manageable number, that would be great. Thank you. Thank you, Alberto. Let me explain you a little bit what is very important.\", \"As you know, Jose explained you exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet. You've got to understand that we're changing completely the model of the bank in the way we used to. The bank used to consume a huge amount of RWA's to generate profits. We're changing the model in a way and the most important thing of that, changing the model is becoming the number one bank to our clients.\", \"But becoming that, basically you generate quite a lot of revenue by something different that just used RWO to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having. You're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right? So if we continue changing this model, just less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital we're doing today, all right?\", \"We feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at this level of capital, but I do believe that we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets, we also have now with the asset desk in place, tremendous capacity to move those assets out of the books, all right? So, and by the way, if you saw what Jose said, we are doing so and making money on top of it. Also, we're servicing, we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell.\", \"So it's a double one in that sense. So the model of the bank is changing in that sense and it's becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital. So yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on an organic way in the future. On the UK, Jose, I don't know if you want to also complement something in capital? No, I think capital you answered perfectly. Alvaro, the issue is complex.\", 'I think just let me remind you of some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months. We need to clarify the perimeter of commissions. We need to clarify the ventages because the ruling talks up between 2025 and 2024, the FCA focuses between 2014 to 2021, the percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest, so there are many moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May, so there are many moving parts.', 'We are analyzing this and obviously we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation.', \"However, we are very confident that as Ektorexplained, the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group and we will still meet our objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16 or slightly above 16%. And that's what we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically speculation.\", \"So obviously we will make a decision based on the actual ruling, based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court guidance on this and in any case, obviously the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision. Thank you, Alvaro. Next question please. The next question, can you turn from the line of Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, Ektan. I'm from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please.\", 'The first one is on the outlook for long growth in Brazil. If I look alone or flat, quarter, quarter in local currency, which is perhaps not particularly encouraging for the NII outlook in the context of rate tax in the region, can you talk about your expectations for long growth here and what this means for NII in Brazil? And maybe I could also please remind us what the time lag is with respect to reprising between assets and liabilities in Brazil.', \"I understand your liability reprise is much faster than assets if you could remind us how many months in lag that is. And my second question is with respect to the US profitability. I mean, this is a part of your business that's negatively correlated to rates. I've been adding at least a number of investment or corporate bankers in the region, which is showing good momentum in fees.\", \"Could you maybe just talk us through the key PNA line items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward, please. Thank you. Thank you, Antonio. Let me go a little bit through the Brazil situation, okay? To tell you a little bit what's going on. It's very important that you understand the following. In Brazil, also, we're changing a little bit the model that we have today. As we know, we used to use very hardly RWAs. We just to basically give out a lot of loans.\", \"Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We're basically focused on profitability, okay? Last term focus on profitability, which is basically changing a little bit the mix. Also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage and we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal.\", \"So we're being very choosing the way we manage that and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we are very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that give the deposit and have their deposits with us. Also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that that basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil, okay? NII, if you see it, it's a good quarter.\", \"It's up more than 3% in the quarter. It's more than 22% in year-on-year. What's behind the performance, as I told you? Healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the local rates because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. If you remember in my presentation, I talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients.\", 'It is true that the rate outlook has changed, but now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected. And we thought at the beginning of the year, but nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian NII to grow around the meetings marked by the end of 24 and we will have further growth in 25. And if we continue with our strategy and getting clients and getting more deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off.', \"Okay, and let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% rate. This is strong profitability improvement. It's not just rely on tonnania growth, but also it's very important, the good delivery on fees because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So selling other products, insurance, some more things that are basically helping us out.\", \"Also it's very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also an stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that, and I don't believe, I really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue spending its profitability through 25. Okay, I don't know, Jose, if you would like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities. Yeah, so liabilities in Brazil basically reprise automatically with the Interbank rates.\", \"So almost 100% of the liabilities are linked to the Interbank rates. 60% of the assets mature in 12 months. So that gives you a sensitivity of the negative sensitivity. We have to rate in Brazil. Thank you. Let me go into the US, Antonio. So it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-fledged commercial banking in the US. We are focused on the businesses. We are focused. Okay. We are focused mainly in our consumer business.\", \"The consumer business, as you say, has negative sensitivity to rates. That's exactly why we launched Open Bank there. And we're also using SBNA, our commercial bank, to fund that. All right. We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have, and as you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICO's really on the prime and near prime level. Okay. And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep-supreme and so prime.\", \"So that basically makes combination and is going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there. In terms of consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are at that scale player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with OEMs, and we were able to capture very good agreements with INIOS, Lotus, Tesla and Mitsubishi.\", \"It's very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the PNL, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of these is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And the electrical vehicles were buying them because it's mostly leasing. So that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you see it on the payback. We have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles.\", \"So that basically changes a little bit the outlook, but all in all, I really see that the US will continue to thrive over the next year or so. Okay? Also in the commercial side, the business is doing well. We have a Dixit Pertis. We also, you know that we have this JV with the FDIC, with it has been tremendously successful, and I think we'll continue so. I had a solid performance and then you talk about the CIV advisory services.\", \"CIV just grew 41% year and year in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also you don't see how the US is helping the rest of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees in CIV in Europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the US teams to help us out, getting some of new business that we didn't use to get.\", \"Also in Latin America, if you take a look at for example, not just cross border in Manay, but if you take a look at what we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in that market just because of the expertise we've brought into the table. So when the Mexican UMS did a 7 billion transaction, the beginning of the year were one of the four banks and we were the only non-American bank in the game.\", \"So those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have the local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing onto the table. And wealth also we have a leading brand in Latin America, that business is basically working as a Swiss clock. So I really do believe that the US will continue to thrive, very good outlook for 25 and really good numbers coming up in terms of the PNL we see there. Thank you Antonio. The next question please.\", 'The next question comes from the line of Martha San Centromero from C.P. please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on the slide. And you have to really mark the line from the process for the past year. You have really good relationship changes on the top of the five sessions. Do you foresee a change of strategy? How do you go on how more serious capital, but how do you see the line and the project going forward?', \"My second question comes on the US deposit for the cost and the volumes of flat in the quarter. It's just on the launch of the month in the country. On your website you send your pay 11 times that that's your average for the post. How much do you accept the terms of volume to gain from your open-bound franchise and where do you see the cost of volume? I'm just thinking and I'm not talking about the real technical growth process for 2020 points. I understand other changes on the CDTAC strategy.\", \"Thank you. We couldn't hear you the first question at all. So could you repeat that one? Sorry about that. And the second question was about the US, but we lost part of it. So a quick answer to that. So, sorry, it's just like the sorry for that. So on the same, you've been using market chain loans on the deposit over the past year. You have made management changes at the top. So do you expect a change of strategy, more risk appetite?\", \"Where do you see loans and the post it's going forward in Spain? Secondly, in the US. So you've launched open bank so far your volumes and cost of the deposits are flat in the quarter. How much deposits do you expect to bring to the platform and what do you see the cost going forward? And sorry, the effective tax rate in the US. Thank you. Sorry for the. Thank you, Martha. Let me go ahead.\", \"In terms of the money changes we have done to Spain, basically they're not going to change the plans that we had before. We're going to basically very much focus on profitability, that's number one. We're also changing the model. Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on one transformation. Okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification, automation in what we have there.\", \"If you compare one of our branches, for example, in portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in a branch in portugal is basically taking care of clients. 50% of what we do in Spain is taking care of incidents, problems, different situations, etc. So it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation, an automation that we need to do on the back in Spain. So we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient and with a much better cost structure.\", \"Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms in Spain is one of the places that we're going to be concentrating the most in the near term. So it's quite important to understand that we will continue doing that. And we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit bets that we have done. So very much concentrated on that. Getting new clients is very important to acknowledge that for the seven consecutive months we have grown on clients in Spain in a mature market.\", \"That basically tells you that the model is working, that exactly where the living on what we believe is a right thing to do. So we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming Spain in what we need to do, but also with the global platforms we're going to be able to be much more competitive, more efficient and better for our clients.\", 'Also, this structure of being the number one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically will allow us to sell the more products. One product that is very important and we are punching below our weight is insurance, for example, in which some competitors are much more vigor than us in that sense. So there is a huge opportunity of we can do that.', \"Also, if you take a look on CIB, CIB with a hatch of really interesting and important deliver, given that we're using our US teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So that is helping us out quite a lot and we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So Spain will continue as we say in terms of the tax rate in the US. Yes, please. No, no, I wanted to talk a little bit. Josetta, I believe that 24 in all in all, we're going to be a strong year for Spain.\", \"We remain optimistic, OK, NII. We see growing in high single digit together with customer growth as I told you and higher transactionality. And we'll drive our revenue up about double digit. The efficiency ratio will continue improving and we see the cost of risk below 50 basis points by year end. OK, and also strong improvements in Rote to a level well above 20%. So Josetta, if you'd like to come into the US.\", \"Just quickly, Marta, this year the tax rate is going to be more or less close to zero. Actually, we're going to actually have a slight credit from the sale of EVs. And from here, it should gradually normalize as we do less EVs and more contribution from other businesses. So we could think of like around 10% next year, maybe 15% next year. So gradually normalizing at that pace, at more or less 10 next year, 15 the following year. Yeah. OK, thanks. Next question, please.\", 'The next question, can someone the line of carus special to from cash bank with the I please go ahead? Yes, hi, good morning. A couple of questions from my side as well. Firstly, on the U.K. NIA outlook, we saw good recovery in the in the third queue. We actually saw improvements in low yields and also lower deposit costs. I was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the into the fourth queue in into 2025.', 'Should we expect margin expansion to prevail or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spread to stabilize more or less around these levels? Is basically how do you see the outlook for NIA in the U.K.? Then if I may pick up a bit on the on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before, you mentioned that you lower the NIA sensitivity in Spain to 25% of what it was prior to to to the change in rate cycle.', \"I was just wondering if you could update this on exactly where where the sensitivity lies now, particularly for for Spain, but also for some of the larger geographies that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. You can't Ros, okay, on the UK, I would like to tell you, I mean, I think it's one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of one transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying, that's something that we are very concentrated on.\", \"Also the automation, what we're doing there, we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have, we started the year with 20,000 people, we're gonna end up with 18,000, so simplification and automation is well underway. And then, as I said on the presentation, it's quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms.\", \"One app came into the UK just about, we did the Big Bang and Change All Our Clients there, and it's becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients, helping us in the deposit base, and also helping us in terms of NPS. Okay, it is important to say that we believe that we have much better market economics dynamics, okay, lending activity, we see it picking up, we are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well.\", \"We see more rational behavior of the UK banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus better pricing of the deposits. We are proactively managing deposits, as I told you, no, first of all with the new clients coming in, with the new H account that we launched, that's being helping us.\", \"So we rate the attribute that NIA will improve in the H2 versus the H1, okay, as you have said, we're gonna finish 24 with NIA down only mid-single digit, instead of the minus 9% that we have reported in the first nine months, and we expect a further rate got in the remaining of 24, but the outlook of 25 is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far. So Carlos, in terms of interest sensitivity, so let me comment for the main countries. For the group as a whole first.\", 'In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NIA to increase next year, maybe two, three percent in Spain. You see in two and a half percent interest rate in Europe for the mid of next year of 2025, we would expect a slight decrease in NIA in Spain. In the UK, a sector just commented a slight increase in NIA. In the US, we would expect high single digit increase. In Mexico, me to high single digit increase in Brazil. This is quite important.', 'The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of NIA. We expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11, 11.5%. With these level of interest rates, NIA in Brazil should be up mid single digits. And basically, and finally in this city also, high single digit increase with a level of interest rates that we just talked about.', 'So as I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for instance, in this city, a center race were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly, significantly lower. Thank you Carlos. Next question please. The next question, can from the line of Andrea Filetri from MedioBanca, please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. First of all, a question of extrapolation.', \"Contensus is forecasting no growth of profits in 2025 versus 2024. You are currently growing profits at 14% year or near in the nine months. And I mean, you usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your view? And the second is a follow up on the capital elaboration I've done before. I'm looking at slide 23. Without regulatory headwinds, you would have built 35 basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution.\", \"Can you confirm with Q4, we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds and is the higher profitability than yielding to higher capital build up versus the 10 basis points per quarter guidance that you've given us. Final thing is the clarification on Basel IV. Before you said that on day one, CT1 should be flatish. If I remember correctly, the word 20 basis points of impacts this year, they should have reversed with Basel IV adoption. Can you clarify that? Thank you.\", \"Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little of what we believe. First of all, I'll most tell you that I have great confidence that we'll deliver. And in some matters like cost to income over the liver on the financial targets that we set on the best or day for the period of 23 to 25, okay? 25 will be better than 24. For 25, we expect to continue to work revenues, especially fees as I explained with a new model deployment that we're doing.\", \"We're gonna further improve the operating leverage and we're gonna deliver higher profitability. And we will do this, how? By leveraging further the global and network businesses, okay? We're putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect where do more with less?\", \"First of all, leveraging also our products and global factories, like for example, from our corporate bank into our commercial banks, what we're doing between CIB and the commercial business on the mid-sized companies and SMEs. Also one transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail. We're talking about minus 4% on year-to-year cost-paractic customer and 6% year-to-year revenue-paractive customer.\", \"So since the start of the program, the number of products as I said before is down almost 36%. 60% of the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program, right? In summary, the strategy and business model diversification, discipline, approach, and capital allocation, we believe the lever a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come. So all in all, yes.\", \"Jose, I don't know if you'd like to comment into the capital. Let me get you all the components of the capital ratio. And I think you can make your own conclusions here. So on page 23, we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation, post 81s, cost of hedges, et cetera, which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk-weighted asset growth, which is 8 billion growth, partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points of five billion.\", \"Remember that so far this year, we've mobilized 35 to 40 billion in terms of risk-weighted assets. And on markets and others, we have seven basis points from the sale of Poland. So with this, I think you can conclude what, more or less, the recurring capital generation we will be able to have going forward. Obviously, the net risk-weighted asset growth, gross risk-weighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component.\", \"Obviously, that excess capital is being, or that capital is being reinvested at 2.9% return on risk-weighted assets, but obviously, it's capital that is being reinvested. Basel IV, you're right.\", 'The maturity will impact the negative impact of the 21 basis points or 22 basis points we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year, and this will compensate the other negative impacts, the one impacts that we have, mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios, corporate portfolios, et cetera.', \"So net net, it's obviously zero, is the net of some positives and some negatives, and amongst the positives is these 20 basis points from the maturity we use in derivative transactions. You're right. Any Andrea, thank you. Next question, please. The next question comes from the line of Ignacio Ferezo from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Sorry, I'm gonna come back to capital in particular.\", 'If you can give us actually the path of those 40 basis points, you have on the full load of basis actually how those scatter review on actually within the next years, specifically how much of that is gonna fall on 2025. Sorry, if you have referred to this actually, I just want clarification.', \"And then related to this, going back basically to what Alvaro was asking before, what did it prefer to use of any potential, like this capital that you're building, that you're thinking basically of accelerating growth, spending a little bit of that, or it's a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing distributions.\", 'And then the final on the capital, actually if I may, what kind of budget for SRTs actually you have, per annum in the next two to three years, building up into your capital forecasts. Thank you. Okay, so the 40 basis points, as you remember, we are not affected by the output floor. And because we use lots of standard models, so that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models, we are not affected by that. That is backloaded.', \"That's what comes later from 2029 to 2033, if I'm not mistaken. We are mostly affected, the 40 basis points is mostly the result of operational risk. That will come over the next four or five years, if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the facing in our case. I think Victor already answered the question about the excess capital and budget. On a recurring basis, obviously the demand for private credit today is enormous.\", \"It's, I'm not gonna say it's infinite, but it's huge. So obviously I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interrates come down, obviously. But we think that on a recurring basis, we should be able to mobilize somewhere between 35 to 55 billion in res-weighted assets. Both obviously SRTs will only be maybe a third of that.\", \"15 billion a year, it's reasonable to assume that 10 to 15 will come from SRTs, and the other will be from all the types of hedges, another type of transactions assets sales, etc. Like we did this year. But on a recurring basis, with a more normalized market, 35 billion, 40 billion per year, it's like a reasonable number. Thank you, Ignacio. Next question, please. The next question comes from the live-on. Sophie Peterson from the AP Morgan, please go ahead.\", \"Yeah, thank you for taking my question. This is Sophie from J.P. Morgan. Sorry to just go back to the organic capital generation. But on the on-a-days goal that you hosted a few weeks ago, you said, or you said that you'd target net zero res-created assets growth on a wrong 50-basis point, organic capital generation per quarter. Is that reasonable to assume going forward on, yeah, that would basically be my first question.\", \"And then the second question is that M&E is a quite hot topic in Europe at this point in time. If you're going to generate more gas down, going forward, how do you think about in organic growth opportunities, what would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of products or regions, and yeah, if you could talk about your thinking in road, M&E, and then the last question would be around Brazil as a quality.\", \"I noticed that the MPL ratio picked up 0.3% quarter and quarter, and also coverage came down quite a lot in Brazil. How should we think about this? Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. Yes, I mean, the answer is in organic capital generation, just you're right. I mean, that's about it. Okay. In terms of the organic opportunities, I do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the group.\", \"I think that the chances, and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming investing class versus the best in class in every single market that we operate, that basically tells you the huge opportunity that we have in front of us. And we will continue like that, we will concentrate on our changes on the go-to model of the bank. I mean, it's a process that is going to take us, at least the next 24 months in order to have also the global platform set in place, et cetera.\", \"So we're very much concentrated on that. Okay. And that's exactly what all the focus of the group is today. In terms of the Brazil-as-alquality, as you have seen, I mean, as you have seen, basically, first of all, I must tell you that we have very strong revenue performance. Okay. Solid evolution on cost, okay. Flat quarter on quarter. But we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality.\", \"Cost of risk is stable at 4.78, and the more recent vintage, just our performing well, and we don't have any signs of deterioration. It's very important that you acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the world we're looking at the Brazilian Portafolio, okay. So as I was telling you before, we just to grow in every single segment of the market. Today, we're not doing so.\", \"We're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have. So you're going to see a much better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so. All right. So it's quite important that you see that. And you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have to forward towards the end of 24 is an stable cost of risk versus 23 around 4.6. And as I said, I mean, with the new changes that we're putting in place, etc.\", \"I think the vintage will perform much better than we expected, okay. Okay. Thanks, Sophie. The next question, please. Thank you. The next question, can you turn the line of British mix from autonomous? Please go ahead. Yeah, I'll be there. Thank you for taking my questions. A few clarifications. When you talk about earnings growth, does that apply to current yields as well? I'm just asking you as you go to 2% and I grow next year in constant yields.\", 'And it might be a little bit lower in current yields and that I would think would have to drive most of the revenues to deliver positive jobs. And then a clarification on the rates. You mentioned 2.5% for your, what do you expect for the full year than as well? What is the average expectation for the year?', 'And then lastly, on Portugal and then at interesting climate decline significantly this year, as we saw a big deposit cost increase, it said just a catch up where the see the competition and where do you expect to end the deposit cost to go in the future. Thank you. So, yes, we would expect income next year to grow mid-single digits with cost fairly flood-ish. So, yes, we would expect revenue operating income to actually increase next year.', \"In terms of interest rates, well, we think 2.5% is the rate that we expect by mid-year and then maybe one drop, one cut more in the second half of the year. So, we do not see 2% as the terminal rate in Europe right now. Obviously, you know, we'll see, but in our case, we are not as negative as the market or positive, depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates. And then, because of the deposits, Brita, you refer to countries, like which country is Spain in particular?\", \"Sorry, I didn't get which country you were referring to. So, we will get back to you after the call. Carlos will give you a call and clarify that. But let me just very quickly in Spain, obviously the betas that we ended up this year, having this year, were much, much lower than the ones that we expected. So, we manage our cost of deposits pretty well. Basically, thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits.\", 'As rates come down, those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Uriber, basically private banking, corporate banking and the large corporations, is adjusting that words as well. So, going forward, we should see actually a positive contribution from year on year, the deposit cost in Spain from 24 to 25. Other euro countries, in Portugal, the situation is a little bit more extreme.', \"So, in Portugal, we would expect an AI to actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year, because they're obviously the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in Spain. Thanks, Prita. Next question, please. Thanks on the line of Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. I just have just one question left. And thank you for the color on 2025 and I in rate sensitivity.\", \"So, it's a bit of a follow-up question, but is the sensitivity to lower euro rates linear as rates move lower or would the negative drag on NII be larger on European rates if we start to move below your expectations or below 2% policy rates? You mentioned earlier, to an average of 25 by the end of the next year, would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards two or below two? Chris, thank you. It also depends on how steep or flat the curve is.\", \"A curve that flattens would have a more negative impact on margins that curve that remains steep. So, obviously if rates go well below 2% and approach zero, obviously from 2 to 0, the impact on margins is greater than from 4 to 2. So, it's not linear. But if rates stay between 2 and 2 and 1 half, I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of NII.\", 'Because again, the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach zero, basically, and we will have at least that 2 to 2 and 1 half percent margin on the asset side. Thanks Chris. And the final question, please. The last question comes from the line of overgroups from KBW. Please go ahead. I think so much for the time. Three quick clarifications if I may. So, first, trading income in Brazil has been quite tweak now for a couple of courts to be negative.', \"Can you give any guidance there? Second, the corporate center NII. Should we expect a positive number in Q4? Or again, any guidance you could give? Third, I heard you on the tax rate for the US. What does that mean for the group? So, can you give guidance on the group tax rate? Thank you. Thank you, Guam. In terms of the trading income, okay, it's in any case very small in the context of Brazil. Total revenue in Brazil's total revenue.\", 'And it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement on profitability. Okay, the client relating trading income has had strong performance in Q3. Okay. However, recent market volatility around the Brazilian and the Yelp curve left to an important deterioration in local assets during Q2, but also in Q3, but we have stabilized those and I believe that the outlook would be much better.', \"This is a challenging market environment and we'll be basically offsetting using Q3 and I believe Q4 is going to be much better. And IA for the corporate center. And IA in the corporate centers should gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center. So, you should expect NII to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level. And finally, the tax rate for the group should be fairly flat next year.\", \"Maybe a touch below what it will be this year, but just marginally. So, you know, for model purposes, I will use the same tax rate in 25 than we will have in 24 same tax rate. And I think we've answered all the questions. Thank you very much, everybody. Investor relations, myself, Fector, are at your disposal to answer any follow-up questions that you may have looking forward to seeing you over the next few weeks on one-on-ones.\", \"And we'll talk to you again for the fourth quarter earnings in January. Thanks, everybody. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.\"], [\"Thank you for joining, Santander's 2024 Results presentation. I'm Raul Senna, Global Head of Invest Relations, and I'm delighted to be here joining our Executive Chair, Ana Boutin, our CEO, Hector Grissy, and our CFO, Jose Garcia Cantela. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure for fully-app presentations. Ana will kick off the presentation by talking about our results and achievements in the context of our strategy. Then Hector will add detail to our financial performance.\", 'Finally, Ana will conclude with our outlook for 2025 before opening for Q&A. Ana, over to you. Thank you Raul, and welcome everybody to our full-year results presentation. 2024 was another record year, the third consecutive year of record results for Santander. It shows the benefits of our strategy, the resilience of our business model. As we said, in 23, we have entered a new phase of value creation, and this has enabled us to deliver or exceed all our key financial targets.', \"Profit reached a record of 12.6 billion euros, supported by both strong revenue growth, and customer growth, we grew 8 million customers, and this happened across all our global businesses in a very balanced way. We have continued to invest for the future, and we're making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model through one transformation.\", 'This has been instrumental in improvements in efficiency by more than 2 percentage points, and increasing our profitability ROTE to 6.3. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong capital ratio, ends the year at an all-time high of 12.8, reflecting our ability to generate capital organically. Finally, we delivered again strong childhood value creation with Tina and Diverin pressure growing by 14%.', 'By the way, this is inspired of pressure from currency evaluation in some markets, which was offset by our profitability and the appreciation of the US dollar, with our US business acting as a natural hedge against the pressure on the Brazilian Real, for example. Let me just go into a bit more detail on our fully up performance.', 'Very high quality of results with strong growth in our top line revenue up 10% in constant euros, and as I said, supported by both customer activity and good delivery across all our businesses. fee income is up 11%, again in constant, supported by significant growth in customers of 8 million, and very much the network benefits we are capturing throughout the group, which already represent about 20 billion, about a third of our revenues, due to being part of the Santander group.', 'Expenses grew well below revenue, showcasing again the positive effects of our one transformation, and we delivered record net operating income of 36 billion. Finally, we continued to be prudent in our cost of risk and at 115, better than our initial guidance for the year.', 'Again, we have shown over time that our results are sustainable and less volatile over the cycle than most of our peers, and this is again because we are retail consumer powerhouse with a business model that combines both geographical diversification with business diversification and a strong risk management. You can see here that all of our five global businesses delivered revenue growth, while we improve profitability.', 'The performance of retail consumer reflects the scale and the benefits of our transformation, one transformation, improving efficiency, but also growing customers. Wealth, CIB, and PaganEx have each delivered improved profitability, again leveraging our network strengths and capabilities. The combination of these global businesses with a geographical diversification places us in a very strong spot for the next year and for the future.', 'We are enhancing our disclosure to allow the market, all of you, to better forecast our global businesses in the same way that we have been doing for years internally. I would also highlight that while higher interest rates benefit our retail franchise in Europe, other parts of our business, such as consumer, and certain developing market geographies, will do better with lower rates.', 'And it is this diversification that allows us to deliver current, strong results, consistent, profitable growth, and value creation. Again, our performance this year, the execution of our strategy puts us on track for our 25 financial targets. On retail, which is the heart of our banking business, we are making very good progress. Our aim is to become the number one bank for our customers. One transformation is delivering excellent results.', \"And by the way, there's a lot more to come, growing 4 million, around 4 million active customers with about to 80 million total, with lower cost per transaction. We are improving our digital onboarding, digital sales, grow by 16%. The number of products has been reduced by almost 40%. With special focus on the front book, and this is, you're going to see benefits of this in the next few years, of course. And you will see there's not just on the cost side, but also on revenues for 25, 26.\", \"Second, we are consistently, but the relentlessly deploying our global platform. In the UK, for example, customers have been migrated to the new global app that's already up and running in Spain, Portugal, and Poland. And again, the global platform rollout and improvements in customer experience will drive additional customer growth with lower absolute cost.\", 'In consumer, our priority continues to be delivering the best solutions, but also for our customers, but also improve our competitive advantage on cost across our footprint. You can see here the operational leverage for the year where we are growing revenues at 6 and decreasing cost by 1%.', \"It's been a ground breaking year in our transformation, and a great example of this is our checkout lending platform Zinia, which again, thanks to our scale and teams, we have been able to partner with both Apple and Amazon and Germany. This is absolutely key, not just today, but for the future, to be where our customers are going to be operating with us under our own brand. We have also successfully launched Open Bank in the US and Mexico.\", \"Open Bank US has gathered 2 billion of deposits, that's about double what we expected, and it's also improving our loan to deposit in the US by about 12 percentage points. It's going to allow us to optimize our US funding structure from the beginning. We are reducing the cost to serve in consumer. It's now significantly, as you can see.\", 'And for 25, and this is key, we actually expect in consumer to be one of our best performing divisions in terms of the upside, where the US being one of the countries that most improves the total country P&O. Other three global businesses, well-CIVA and payments, other ones driving fee growth, we anticipated this to you all in 23 due to very strong network effects and also leveraging technology.', 'Our corporate bank, we are focused on the markets where we are present with a strong footprint, and as you know, we are delivering good growth in profits. We are maintaining our usual risk profile. In the US, in 2024, corporate bank fees have increased by 21 percent and revenues are by 14 percent. We are building the best wealth insurance manager in a footprint, again, leveraging on our network.', \"We have revenues of 15 percent in 24 with fees up again, double digits across the three business line. In payments, we are building the backbone to connect the group across different businesses and geographies. It's essential in our one transformation. This is a very big market and a growing opportunity. In 2024, payments volume is up 11 percent and the key metric that we committed to EBITDA margin is close to a 30 percent target for this year, for 25. We are very close to that already.\", 'Going forward and especially in an environment of lower rates in Europe, CIV, wealth and payments are going to be critical in ensuring our targets for this year, including the fee income growth. So all of this performance, the strong operational and financial performance, is driving higher capital generation, double digit value creation and shareholder return, fully loaded CET1, rose to 12.8.', 'At the end of December, January 1st, still to have 0.8, supported by record organic capital generation, after investing in profitable growth, increasing remuneration to shareholders and absorbing regulatory impacts. At current prices, share buybacks remain the best way to generate shareholder value.', \"Since 21 and including this new share buyback we've announced today for the year, on 24 earnings, we will have repurchased 15 percent of outstanding shares with a return on investment approximately 18 percent for our shareholders. And there is more to come. Here we're going to have financial performance in more detail, but let me just briefly, given that I only get a chance to be with you all once a year, at least formally, remind all of you of our model and our strategy.\", \"As I say, this is a marathon. It's not a sprint. And in every single sprint, we're delivering what we committed. And this is because we're delivering numbers and results as we guide you every year, but we're also building the Santander of tomorrow. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform for all our customers. We are working to become more competitive in a way that few others can replicate.\", \"And this is based on a unique combination of a customer base of 173 million customers, a global scale with local leadership, and very important, all of this leading to high visibility of our results and predictability through the cycle. And the biggest area of upside, even today for Santander, comes from the network effects of belonging to the group across our footprint and through the global business. Our confidence in our guidance stems because a lot of what's coming is under our control.\", \"And all of this, let me stress, in what we do anticipate a much more challenging and volatile macro. Just a few examples of how this is not a PowerPoint. This is already delivering numbers and results for our shareholders and for our customers. This is some of the global platforms that are up and running and contributing to the performance and financial performance which you're seeing, and which is increasingly, and this will continue to increase, making us different from our peers.\", 'These platforms will deliver and partly delivering already best services and better efficiency. Open bank is out there to bank, rolled out now in the US and Mexico. Zini I mentioned already, in 24, there were 1.7 million new contracts, and we are signing in new countries with these partners. And gravity, our core system where our partner is Google, is being offered to third parties through our joint venture, but it has already enabled CentaN there to reduce our cost for transaction by 10%.', \"But it's obviously helping us to do much more than that in terms of the frontend systems. Again, we are confident we will compound growth throughout the cycle, creating value for our shareholders. Just a brief reminder of how this business model has already delivered the numbers. You can see it here, sustainable earnings growth year after year, improvements in profitability. Over the last decade, we have doubled our profit.\", 'Actually, we have tripled if you go back to the end of 2013 and a new record again in 24. We have attracted 56 million new customers to CentaN there, our OTA profitability increased to 16.3 from 2011 and 2014. And of course, we have steadily built capital throughout this period. I just want to remind us, actually, when I took over, we started with a CET ratio of 8.3%. And of course, the way we calculate capital is not the same.', 'But very importantly, for you, our shareholders, our shareholders, we have increased six times a whole-terrain generation. We are now closing at 12.8, which is near the top of our target operating range. Let me just stress operating range. We are not changing our target of over 12. And this is, as I just mentioned, despite our double inflation. So last but not least, before I turn over to Ektor, this is our North Star. And this is our North Star since 23.', \"We could not target and commit to Tina and everyone before 23, for reasons that you all know well. The progress towards the targets that we set is well ahead of plan. We continue to be focused on profitability and being very disciplined on capital allocation. Today, we have 87% of our OWA's above cost of equity for the improving our profitability to above 16%. So let me now pass to Ektor who will take you over of national performance in Modiglia. Ektor, please. Yes, thank you, Anna.\", 'I will look at our performance in cost and currency, including the impact of Argentina or a conservative approach to effects was adjusted in Q4. This resulted in a positive impact on NII with a negative offset in other income in cost. Let me start by highlighting our strong top line performance. We achieved double-deeage revenue growth, exceeding the targets we provided at the start of the year, and even the ones we upgraded during the year.', 'This was underpinned by sound growth and customer activity across the businesses while reflecting the benefits of our model. The strong increase was mainly supported by the next things. First, a retail business which continues to grow at double-deegate with good performance and both NII and fees.', \"A record year in CIV, up 14% on the back of our investments and good activity levels, and 15% revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and a really good performance of Santa and Deras' management and insurance. Custom consumer and payments are also showing very good revenue trends with consumer delivering double-deegate growth in fees and both Pagan X and Cards growing. More than 80% of the group's NII comes from our retail and consumer businesses.\", \"The group NII's grew double-deegate in 24, with name up driven by acid repricing and controlled cost of deposits. Over the last few quarters, we have proactively managed our interest rate sensitivity to position our balance sheet for the new outlook on interest rates. In Spain, for example, our NII was flat quarter-over-quarter part of due to our hedges. And in Brazil, our negative sensitivity to a 100-basis points rising rates is now lower at around 120 million euro.\", 'Going forward, our outlook for 25 for the group is similar to what we set in Q3. Excluding Argentina, we expect NII to be slightly open, constant, and slightly down in current durals based on forward rates. In an environment of low-credit demand in general, we generated another record performance in fee income, from network effects from all our global businesses.', 'Retail increased due even by the strong performance across our footprint on the back of good commercial dynamics and the customer growth. In 24, we put a greater focus on deploying targeted high-value other products and services and this is expected to be a positive driver in 25.', 'In consumer, we delivered double-deed growth fees across our core markets, driven by insurance and DCB in Europe, Brazil and out to the US, and in 25 we expect consumer fees to be slightly down due to the impact of the new regulation and insurance. DCB also grew strongly to record levels, supported by all CAB products with a US at top contributor for fees nearly doubled. In wealth, we delivered a very strong performance with double-deed fee growth backed by record assets on their management.', 'Excluding a one-time positive fee recorded in cars who in 23, payments fees were up slightly and are expected to grow strongly during 25. One transformation is key to why we can continue to get better in every single market, thanks to leveraging our global businesses, with expect sustainable improvements in operating leverage as this is a structural change in our model that will deliver benefits for years to come.', 'Retail and consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains, an operating leverage with cost growth of 1%. Well below revenue growth of 9%. These two businesses represent 70% of our cost-base and will continue to see lower cost going forward. CAB and wealth cost, increased by 13% year-on-year, showing positive jobs while driving higher fee income and payments operating performance, reflects our strategic investments.', 'As a result, our cost-to-incompration improved from 41.8 for 24, the best we have ever reported in 15 years and better than our original guidance. There is still more upside over the medium-term format of our strategy. Both revenue and cost. While we are ahead of our plan on execution of one transformation and global tech capabilities, we have more to do capturing network effects across our global businesses.', 'This has delivered 66 basis points of improvements for our cost-to-incompration with more upside to our original target of 100 to 150 basis points. Retail and consumer and more than 70% of our earnings and have significant upside. The rest of our earnings come from wealth, CAB and payments, which are feed-driven and will play to our network strengths. Our balance sheet, as you can see, is rock solid.', 'Credit quality is stable across our footprint ahead of our expectations with low unemployment and easy monetary policies in most of the countries, except for Brazil. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected in both NPL ratio and lower-correct needs. NPL ratio was 3.05% improving both year-on-year and Q&A. The NPL portfolio has collateral, warranties and provisions that account for around 90% of its total exposure.', 'The cost of risk improved to 1.15% better than our target of around 1.2% for the year. In our retail business, 12-month cost of risk improved year-on-year to 0.92%, with sound underlying trends across all the countries. In Brazil, we have grown credit at the slower pace on our peers and have made improvements to our portfolio on the righting over the past few years.', 'Meanwhile, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk finished at 2.16%, in line with the normalization expected in 24, supported by the good portfolio behavior in the US Auto as we had expected since the beginning. Moving on to capital, where we delivered an exceptional outcome in Q4, our city-1 ratio grew by 30 basis points in the quarter, backed by strong organic capital generation. We have been working on accelerating our capital generation for some time.', 'In Q4, we generated 82 basis points organically, in the back of the profit generation and RWA modification. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book, written on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% equivalent to an ROTI of 23%.', \"We have reached 87% of RWA's with returns above the cost of equity, up from 40% in 2015 and well above our target of 85% in 25%. Our asset desk is achieving exceptional results during the year, with a post of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 60 billion in RWA's. The combination of these actions is playing the expanding profitability and the good performance on capital. All in all, we are in a new phase of value creation driven by higher profitability.\", 'Looking back at the period since 2016, our value creation has clearly accelerated and since 2022, we have been able to generate an average 15% value to our shareholders. This is driven mainly by the step-up in our profitability and helped by our diversification. Our exposure to the US dollar through our US businesses has sacked it as a natural hedge against the appreciation of the Latin currencies.', \"Let me highlight the sensitivity of our equity to foreign currency, which clearly shows that currency depreciation in Brazil and Mexico is at least partly of set by our exposure to the stronger US dollar working as a natural hedge. That's all from my side, Ana, over to you. Thank you very much, Ector. So let me briefly sum up our performance in 2024. Once again, confirms our consistent delivery on our plans.\", \"We deliver what we say we will deliver in every single plan and every single year on the key financial metrics for the group. We're on track to either achieve or exceed our financial targets set in 2023. 2024 was another record of a Santander. Our results showed the benefits from our strategy, the resilience of our business model, which again allows us to deliver through the cycle despite volatility. So looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy works.\", \"It's evident in the numbers and that it will continue to drive sustainably higher returns. This is reflected in the targets you can see on the slide for 25, which are based on a mobile hotel context. We do expect volatility uncertainty and a challenging environment for the next year. Our macro outlook includes a mild tariff war, a lower euro rates, also a strong dollar. We expect to deliver resilient revenue despite these lower rates and effects around the same as the zero 62 billion in euros.\", 'It means we will be growing in constant currency and supported by mid to high single digit growth in fees and constant euros. Our aim this year is to reduce cost and absolute terms year on year in euros. Again, positive operating leverage in 25 in spite of these lower rates, mostly in Europe. We are expecting a stable cost of risk at the group level with improvements in some markets of setting others.', 'And again, all of this will lead to increased profitability with returns above 17% on the same basis as we guided in 23 exceeding that top end of our investor day. And I just want to flag that from now on we will report ROT post 81, which is what most of our peers do. With these more conservative lens, we are targeting 16, about 16.5% as you can see. And this again is post 81s.', 'Very importantly, given the strong outlook for capital progress and profitability, we are targeting to distribute euro 10 billion euros in share buybacks to our shareholders for 25 and 26 out of 25 and 26 earnings. This will consist of distributing in line with our existing policy around 50% of our reported profit, which will be distributed approximately 50% in cash dividends and 50% in share buybacks. As you know, we announced the second buyback on 24 earnings today at 1.6 billion.', 'And second, excess capital in the two years. So 25 and 26, excess capital following our annuals and results. And of course, our capital hierarchy, which we can go into later. And again, as always, subject to regulatory approvals and the performance we are outlining to you today. Very importantly, we will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks. Reflecting our improved profitability and improvement ahead.', 'I would like to end by saying again, our not-star will continue to be delivering double-digit growth in Tinavan, dividend pressure through the cycle. So with that, we are here to answer your questions, which I think Raul, you will be managing. Thank you, Anna. Can we have the first question, please? Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press the start 5 on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Ignacio Urlardi from BMP Paribas. Please go ahead.', \"Thanks very much for the presentation. And thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just wanted to thank you very much for the improvement in the financial target disclosure and the fact that I am not using this ROT-P-81. There are going to be questions and have two questions today. After the announcement on the extraordinary distributions, there is going to get further color on the trade of that UC between O'Connick and Inoconic growth.\", 'How excess capital ranks in terms of management priorities in 2025 and 26? Especially in the context of the M&A that we are seeing in the European bank and sector. Second thing is, when I just looked at the results of one transformation, the results are very good. I just wanted to see how much more the group is going to income can improve from here. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ignacio.', \"So yes, it's important to remind, and this is not different, but how we are thinking about the capital allocation going forward, in the anticipated higher profitability and excess capital. First of all, our capital allocation framework has, as I said, already been a fundamental pillar of our strategy and the results we are delivering, and we have been very disciplined and strict. So, first, we prioritize profitable organic growth. Investments across our businesses.\", 'We see ourselves as a compounder. So again, this organic growth creates a compounding effect on earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second. This is followed, of course, by ordinary dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. In terms of an organic capital deployment, we are very clear that it has to be complementary to our strategic aims and generate attractive financial returns that have to be ahead, that surpass those of any organic investments or share buybacks.', \"And last but not least, and this is what we announced today, any incremental capital that exceeds our targets, our target range, actually. And again, I want to be clear that we are not changing the target for capital above 12. We are saying, as you've seen in the guidance, that we will be at 13 percent in 25. So any incremental capital following this hierarchy that I just described, we'll be returned as additional rebuenerations to shareholders.\", \"In terms of cost, and I think I said that and the CEO said that also. This is incredibly important because out transformation, one transformation still has a lot of upside, especially in the retail and consumer areas that are 70 percent of our PAT and 70 percent of our cost. One transformation is already delivering. You can see that in actor slide where you can see that our cost basically flat across retail consumer with a top line growing. But very importantly, we've grown 8 million customers.\", \"This is something you will see in the next few years that we have a strategy and a model with one transformation that scales. We don't have to increase cost to grow customers and grow revenues. I said it also in my presentation that the fact that we have reduced our products on offer and retail by almost 40 percent. You're going to see the effects of that on the cost base, by the way. Also on the revenue side in 25 and 26.\", 'Critical to all of this is that we are aligning our business and operating model and deploying our own tech platforms. This is going to help much more down the road. Just to give you an example, gravity, our core system, which drives a lot of the efficiencies and the front end customer tech platforms is operating in 30 percent of the group. We expect to be at 60 percent by the end of 25. This is hugely important. So again, new paradigm for 25.', \"We are focusing on absolute cost base going down versus 24. Despite effects and inflation, this is something we feel very confident about. Given this is important, I don't know if you want to mention maybe actor a couple of the precise numbers on the different global divisions. Yes, thank you. Asana has said, what is very important to understand is one transformation is just starting.\", \"Let me provide you a little bit more color on the cost of evolution in the quarter by businesses and also the 25 outlook. First of all, as you can see, 24 costs increased by 4 percent year and year, but in real terms, cost only only 1 percent. That's basically thanks to the operating leverage in retail and the cost containment that we have done in consumer despite investments and growth that we have been able to do.\", \"So it's important to say that we are basically changing the engine, we are flying the plane at the same time. Retail and consumer represents around 70 percent of the group cost were flatish while the revenue was up 9 percent. CIV and wealth does around 20 percent of the group cost and they just increase by 13 percent that's how you set in the presentation with positive jobs and showing sustainable income growth around 21 percent.\", \"That's basically what is doing, the investments we are doing are actually representing much more growth in the businesses. There are many 10 percent statements which increase by 8 percent year and year, but that reflects our strategic investments. Let me go directly, I mean retail and on 25, we expect cost down versus 24 in current years and we expect to rate or improve the guidance that we provided for each business at the last investor day.\", \"So that's retail cost to income below the edit target of less than 42 percent and flat excite Argentina so that was basically around 39.7 percent. More cost to income is down and is going to be less than 40 percent and CIV is going to be below 45 percent. Thank you. Thanks, Ector. Next question please. Next question from Mara Sanchez from City, please go ahead. Good morning, thank you very much. My first question is about the UK.\", \"When you say that the market is core, does it also specifically apply to the retail bank, to the ring fence entity? And if that's the case, what do you see sustainable returns in an environment where you have to compete against stronger deposit franchises and new entrants with the pockets? My second question is on the US, you've delivered $1.2 billion this year of net profit, but you're still benefiting from maybe tax credits.\", \"I think you've mentioned on the call that you expect the US to be the largest contributor to earnings growth in 2025. Could you be a little bit more specific about how much you expected to contribute, what are the levers and what is the tax return, sorry, the tax rate that's you. And then just quickly clarification on capital, the threshold for surplus capital distribution is now 13 percent. Thank you. So let me answer the last one first. We're not putting a threshold.\", \"We've said, we will be at 13 by the end of this year. The buybacks will happen in 2526. I have explained a hierarchy, so it will depend on what organic growth we will have. We're going to be very mindful as we have in terms of the reference being buybacks for shareholders, organic growth, supporting affront chis, it's hard to be. So precise, we don't have a crystal ball.\", 'What we do have is a track record that shows that in challenging times we do better than our peers, we are confident that we can deliver the group targets that we just said. So let me just UK US. So in terms of the UK, first is that the outlook for our business in the UK, which is 88 percent retail, continues to be very resilient. And we are committed to the UK. This is a number. UK retail within the group is 9 percent. And UK retail we expect to do better.', 'So again, good outlook for our business in the UK. And by the way, UK NII has bottomed out in the second half of 24. And we expect that to be slightly up next year. Second is crucial to our results and performance in the UK is of course a mortgage. A mortgage lender essentially. And what we are seeing is that asset quality continues to be resilient. We are being very conservative in terms of how we stress. I think we stress around 8 percent.', \"Maybe actor or a hosicon confirm that, but I believe that's a number. So we have very strong underwriting criteria and that is essential for our returns. And third, what we are very confident is that actor has explained it for one transformation. We can do much more in the UK by leveraging the global platforms, bringing out global scale to benefit the UK.\", 'We have already migrated the UK to gravity and some of the improvements are going to be ahead as we improve customer experience but also reduce the cost to serve. So again, there is more upside to our profitability. It remains a co-market as we have said. On the US, I want to first say that we are very committed to having a strict capital allocation. This is really important for us and has been important throughout.', \"The UK has been top of all our countries, all our geographies over the last decade. And top also the last five years. This is really important because we are committed and have been on this capital allocation and returns in euros to Asha Holtz. Part of that is the strong dollar and it is a natural hedge against and even more now that the earnings are going up. So that's the first point. The second is that we refocused our strategy in the US a couple of years ago and we were very clear.\", 'We are not trying to be all things to all people. We want to deliver profitable growth anchored on four pillars. First, our consumer bank. That is 70% of what the US as a geography is. But it continues to improve. Consumer will be one of our best performing divisions in terms of the delta. And that is not just the US but also consumer Europe. With lower rates consumer, which is about 20% of our PAT, will do better and will improve profitability driven by results in the US.', \"We are not going to give a specific number but it's hundreds of millions more if you do the math. Very importantly, the launch of open bank is going to help us optimize funding and even more so in the context of maybe not so much lower dollar rates. In terms of the corporate bank, it's being hugely accretive to our network. If you look at our corporate bank within the group, most of the returns are coming in country. So over half of our corporate bank is actually Brazil and Spain.\", \"The US is helping us to leverage that network. If said, we will not materially increase capital allocation and it's being a very significant driver of fee growth in the US. Corporate investment banking is up 81% year on year. And finally, we have a very profitable, again very much focused on our lifetime franchise worth business. So we will continue to allocate organic capital to the United States and to the Americas. The specific question on taxes. Taxes? Yeah. Either actor or Jose on taxes.\", \"Let me just complement a little bit. I mean, to what Anna was saying. I mean, in the UK, just to give you an idea in terms of what you were asking, revenue is going to be up mid single digits and we expect a lot of around 11%. Okay, I'm talking in constant. We have no view on effects at this point. Okay. It's very important also to tell you that, I mean, we have 14 million clients in the UK. We're starting to sell different products to them.\", \"As Anna said, we have a basically more touch franchise over there, but we're starting doing some other businesses with them. We're starting to do credit cards, credit cards starting to grow is the second largest market in the world. So we're starting to cross selling to that client base. And that basically is helping us out. We have a much better franchise and we have the capabilities to do it because we have a business at scale that allows to do so.\", \"In terms of the US, I'll just give you, I mean, in terms of guidance, as you were asking, I mean, we see revenue up high single digit, okay, an accounting rotate would be around circa 10%. If you adjust the rotate because of the excess capital that we have, we're talking about about a 14%. So it's quite good.\", \"And in regards to what the tax on the tax, I understand, I mean, I explained you very well the situation due to the fact that what we're doing in terms of leasing, we're really going to find out the size of the numbers until we see how we're going to allocate that one throughout the year. So, okay, all right, thank you. Thanks, thanks, Marta. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from the Lange of Francisco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead.\", 'Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first one is on capital. I wanted to ask you about the 13% city one target for 25. If that 13% already includes any special share of a back beyond the ordinary distributions that we should expect in 25 or if the special share of a back will be back and loaded to 26.', 'And in this context, I wonder if you can guide us on the organic generation that we should expect in 25, particularly also on the plans for risk transfers in this year and also on any negative regulatory inputs, a base for other inputs, DTAs in Brazil, etc. And my second question is about Brazil. How do you see your business operating in a higher-saleic environment? What is your appetite for long growth? How big a squeeze from margins from the higher rates?', 'How sensitive the cost of risk to the saleic and then on your, you can update also on your transformation plans here in this market. Thank you. So on capital, let me just give you a high level and then also maybe can give you a more detail or a little bit. But let me just reiterate, we will distribute excess capital and our capital hierarchy is what we have said earlier. Economic growth, distributions, discipline in an organic and extraordinary over those aims.', 'So again, we have a lot of organic opportunity that is profitable. We cannot know how much of that is going to happen. Point number two, we are not changing our target for capital. It will remain above 12%. Our operating range will be between 12 to 13 and the excess buybacks over the ordinary buyback and cash distributions will be during 25 and 26. We are not going to be more precise than that.', 'Again, go back to the hierarchy and we want to have and we want to deliver the best possible for our shareholders. We have that optionality given our model. In terms of the regulatory ladder, do you want to act or who wants to? High back up. Sorry. Sorry, Paco. So, in terms of risk-wether as a growth, we would expect ordinary business-driven risk-wether as a growth of around 4 to 5%. Mostly compensated by asset mobilization initiatives.', \"So net, we would expect to see very little risk-wether as a growth, maybe 1 or 2%. Regulatory charges, we expect to have a figure close to 2024. And again, there is a high degree of uncertainty here because of the technical notes that need to be released by the EVA. But a bit more or a bit less than what we have seen this year. Okay, let me give you the high level on Brazil. Let me just first say that without Brazil, we will deliver on our guidance. That's what we've done for the last 10 years.\", 'In terms of the group, let me remind you 62 billion approximately, flat cost, stable cost of risk with an ROT after 81 of 16 and a half. In terms of Brazil, retail business, which is the one sensitive to moving rates. These are numbers that with the additional transparency on the global business, you can actually hopefully have as much confidence in that we will deliver as we do as a management team. So, retail Brazil contributes about 38% of Brazil net profit.', 'And that is 7% of the overall Santander Group at Tributal Profit. The rest of our global businesses in Brazil, which contribute more than 60% consumer corporate payments and wealth, we expect to continue to do well. By the way, this is more or less the same as for all the other countries. IE for the group, 50% roughly of our bottom line, 60% of our balance sheet is retail. All the other businesses, I said that in my presentation, should grow revenues much more than retail next year.', \"So this is part of the work we've done in one transformation. In consumer, it's part of the work we're doing with our network businesses leveraging on our customer relationships. All in all, what we expect is Brazil wrote to be stable in 25 as a country driven by higher customer revenues and especially fee income. Contained cost, and this is really important, one transformation will also be very important in Brazil with a flat cost to income roughly in 25.\", \"I'm very important we have structurally improved the quality of our balance sheet in 22 and have been prudent on growth. Thank you. We have the next question, please. Hello, from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First of all, I'd appreciate the color you gave earlier on the strategy in the US.\", \"When you see and hear the messaging around potentially a more accommodating regulatory backdrop in that market, how does that impact the business in the US and where does that create opportunities and how could that potentially impact your strategy in the US if at all? And then secondly, that's more of a modeling question. Looking at Q4, there was a higher than usual level of other gains and losses in provisioning and I think the full year number of 4.8 billion was up significantly year ago.\", \"Can you just walk through what is in that line and how much of that is investment into future efficiency improvements, restructuring, etc. and where should that line item trend across 2025 and 26? Thank you. Okay, so on the US, I've said it many times, operating context matters. So yes, other things equal if the operating context improves in the US that will naturally drive better returns, other things equal vis a vis other regions. So we cannot be too specific right now.\", \"We really don't know what's going to happen but everybody and ourselves included is anticipating a better operating context for banks in the United States, which again, other things equal should drive over time at least increased capital allocation, as I've said before. I mean, our investment in the US has always and even more now since we are in a growth mode, leverage the group. Even top of that, we get a better environment. We should do better.\", \"And that's what I said before, the US, as a geography will be one of the biggest upsides in our P&L without being too specific. But I think we said that, the ROTE, Ector said it, he said 14, I would say, Ector respectively between 14 to 15 percent, adjusted ROTE. I hope you agree on that. So yes, 14 to 15 percent. And the reason is very simple, consumer business is 70 percent. That already is higher and what's dragging down this year, but not next year.\", \"And of course, very positive contribution is the CIB investment, which as I said, is leveraging the network. In terms of other, I would let either Ector or Jose to answer in bit more detail. But yes, in that other, there are some one offs, for example, over 300 million, I remember correctly, in Pagonext restructuring. This is going to drive a much better performance in our payments division next year. Again, that's going to be one of the biggest upsides.\", \"So we are being very disciplined, not just without, you know, where do we put our capital in terms of lending, but where do we put our capital in terms of growth? We decided to get out of acquiring in Europe. That is going to drive a much better performance by focusing on our co-markets and acquiring, which is mostly Latin. There's a couple of things that are recurring there and a couple of others that are not. So maybe you want to take that, Ector? Sure, Ana.\", \"I mean, to complete what Ana has said in 24, the following one of the events impacted our Pina Lace, especially. I mean, in Q124, we had a higher temporary levy on the revenue in Spain, that's a $335 million. In Q224, I mean, the write down that she was explaining about Pagonext, in Q3, 70 million related to the foundation. And in Q424, that's 260 million provision taken for the situation with the motor in the UK. So only in all that's basically it.\", \"And we don't expect any of those to basically repeat themselves. Maybe just I mean, in terms of the tax levy in Spain, that we will be basically being impacted on the first quarter this year. Thanks very much, Ector. Any other questions please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Orangistan. Leap please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. I've got a couple of fellows on one on Capital and another one on the global platforms. On Capital, there's a sort of trend globally.\", \"It seems like around the regulation. I just wanted to take your brain down, maybe, on how do you think that's going to manifest itself? Sandana, because ultimately I heard, I'm also guiding for another close to 60 basis points. Capital had to win this year, similar to last year. Obviously, there was a press report here this week where you've taken the ECB, the SEMT to court around the details in Brazil.\", \"So can you maybe give us your latest thoughts on how regulators are going to treat the banks here in Ford and in particular, how do you see that they have a centa there? And second on platform on your consumer retail, I think your cross-think comes now 40%. I've heard your comment during the call. Could you maybe drop us through which countries still need to roll our gravity from here? And what we think about how low those costs and all those cost income can go.\", \"Who do you benchmark yourself against? Can you give us an idea of how good it can get? Thank you. Medium-term doesn't have to. I've heard your targets for this year. Thank you. So Alvaro, that is a tricky question. You're asking me what the regulators are going to do. You know, I wish I knew. But I would say that for the first time in 10 years, the probability, and I've said it publicly, I've said it in many different locations and recent meetings, including, I think, in yours.\", \"I think first, Europe has built 300 billion in capital, something like this over the banks the last few years. The fact that, you know, we have built capital in many cases twice. I mean, our economic capital, we've said many times, is lower than our current targets. And we will keep those targets, of course, because it's something which the market and regulators have surprised us. So we don't want to be surprised, as we said, 12 to 13 is a big buffer on buffers.\", \"But I would say that, again, for the first time in 10 years, and especially given the outlook for the US regulation being, I would say, less. Rather than more, means that at least, and this is, again, what I've said, let's take a pause. Not just on regulation, but how you interpret regulation. We need to be able to compete on a level playing field. DTA is in Brazil. Even in the case of a dissolving the bank, have value. You know, the direct claim against the government.\", \"We feel very strongly that puts us at the disadvantage, as we compete with the US and local banks in Brazil. So, you know, it's not a big number, by the way. It's more a question of principle, because every single bank in Europe has similar issues. So I do think, you know, we should be in a more predictable era, but, you know, the still CRR, there's still models. And so we want to make sure that.\", \"And the big difference is that, in spite of that, given our strong profitability outlook, the change in the model, the fact a lot depends on us. That's why we are saying we are aiming for additional distributions beyond the regular distributions. In terms of retail and the platforms, you've seen it in, you know, we call one transformation for the whole business model across the five divisions. But the biggest upside is on retail and consumer. You've seen that.\", \"I think Ektor just gave you some numbers. There is a lot of upside. Gravity is an enabler. It's not the biggest contributor to scaling. The fact that you have gravity allows you to bring, you know, through APIs, a lot of the other products that we are building, a lot of the other benefits of being cloud-native, payments is another one payments hub, which is still being rolled out. So, a lot of the work is about a lining business model, a lining the organization, and then comes the technology.\", \"And that is why we see a lot of upside in our retail consumer platform, basically bringing together 170 million customers, which, you know, we have about 4 million companies, commercial corporates. But a lot of that is retail consumer. Alvaro, you're fairly quickly. I mean, as Anna was saying, just retail and consumer are the ones that are the most important ones. I mean, in terms of cost to income, retail and consumer is going to be around flat in terms of cost to income.\", \"And consumer basically is going to be down low single-deget. Okay, so that's what we are seeing for 25. Thank you. Thanks very much, Alvaro. If you have the next question, please. Next question from Andrea Filtre from Media Banker. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll start with your guidance. Consensus is over one billion behind your minimum guidance for 2025 profits. Do you see further growth in 2026 or 25? And where is consensus to conservative from your standpoint?\", \"Second question is on one transformation. A bit of a follow-up to what Alvaro just asked. But where are the next geographies you're planning to roll the plan out to? And given you're now looking at absolute numbers, how much do you think one transformation will save in absolute European exitful facing? And finally, capital, 13% city one is what we hoped to convince the market on fundamental capital strength. I hear you on the maintaining 12 to 13% operating level.\", \"But are you amending the 10 to 15 basis points organic city one client per quarter, which was based on a much lower profitability and approach to risk with the asset? And for second, please make explicit what sort of regulatory hurdles you're expecting for in basis points. Can you just say we will be seeing that to 2024. Thank you. So the answer to your first question without being very specific on numbers is, you know, we will grow our bottom line and we will grow our profitability in 25.\", \"I think I can say that our expectation is this will continue in 26, 27. We'll get a lot more detail in our next investor day, which we expect to do towards the end of this year or beginning of next year. The model still has a lot of upside. As I've said today, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a group in a context that we do anticipate and we count will be volatile. So we're challenging.\", \"We're saying we will grow profits and profitability with stable cost in euros and cost coming down and stable cost of risk. So again, yes, Santander will continue to deliver increasing profits and profitability with all the evidence and with all the obviously market assumptions we're making. In terms of one transformation, at the end, you know, we are aiming to grow customers, grow revenues and improve efficiency. This is not about cost savings.\", \"This is about changing fundamentally how we operate the bank. We are working across the bank to make sure there's end to end accountability, for example. The same way we're building payments or gravity, we're going to build investments and others. What this means is that you're going to see the savings not just in one country, but in the global business, benefiting all the countries. This is a very important difference.\", \"As I said before, by being part of Santander, we are generating 20 billion already today of network efficiencies. This is how we will generate further efficiencies. Today we're still building investment products in open bank and retail in wealth.\", \"As of next month, we're going to have an actor, please confirm this, because that's actually between both of us, but under actor, once we create a single investments platform across the group, we're going to save money, we're going to build a better investment platform and we're going to grow faster. You need to think of this by global businesses. Having said that, what is at the end the bottom line best performing division next year?\", \"In terms of the delta, retail will be more or less flat in terms of profitability because, yes, rates matter. Not as much as people think because if you go country by country, it's only 50% roughly, 55, 45. That is retail and of that, there is the diversification by country. Again, you'll see absolute cost savings across the divisions and some of that will benefit one country more than other.\", \"Maybe actor, you want to add to that briefly in terms of in a minute, but in terms of capital, just going, regulatory hurdles, maybe Jose, you can take that more detail. 12 to 13 is operating range. We've been very clear on that. 13 is not a new minimum, but it is where we want to be by the end of this year. We will distribute excess capital following a capital hierarchy of more or less organic, profitable growth. Again, that's difficult to predict.\", \"We want to make sure we maximize shareholder value creation. 1015 basis points per quarter. That is actually much more than that now, but why don't I let you answer that? Hi Andrea. In terms of the regulatory charges, it's a combination of lots of small things in terms of model reviews and updates, inspections and the potential impacts from the RTSS published by the EVA. In terms of 10 to 15 per quarter, we are not changing that. I think we have great growth opportunities as I discussed.\", \"The most important thing is not evenly distributed throughout the year. It's the growth in capital as we saw this year. It's 10 to concentrate on the end of the year, second quarter and fourth quarter. Thank you Andrea. You are too complemented. There are three important points. I want to be brief. First of all, we are becoming the number one back to our customer. That's the most important change of the model. That's why you see fees growing.\", \"If you analyze contrary eye-contry, you will see, for example, in retail, this is the biggest change. That's basically guiding you meet high single-dead growth in terms of fees. That's the change of the model. Remember that also the change of the model is not just the platforms. It's basically simplification, which is helping us and is dropping the amount of products. Now we just offered no more than 50 products to our customers.\", \"We still have a lot of the backlog, without automatizing all of that. So automation is another very important part. And then the deployment of the platforms, for example, we finished the deployment of one up all of Europe. You see the results of the NPS on the UK. Now it's coming down to Brazil. Meet part of the year. It's going to be in Mexico and then it's coming down to Chile and Argentina. And that you're going to be basically see the results, which will improve first of all.\", \"And then we'll be number one bank to our customers. And second, the fee generations. Thank you. Thanks very much, Hector. We have the next question, please. Next question from the line of Cecilia Romero from Marcus. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the results. My first one is in Europe, where do you see the most significant opportunities for expansion and growth of within the two-year geographically?\", \"You talked about the US, but is there any other countries where you see the one gaining a scale? For example, Mexico. Also, I wanted to ask you on the quarter in regards to the very different dynamics that we're seeing in Portugal and Spain and I. Spain was flat and Portugal at minus 11%. Could you explain why such a divergent trend and is this where we're going to see in 2025?\", 'It was serious and I am Spain and I am Portugal, Pauline, I will be just and you please let us know what your race assumption is in this garden. Thank you. So in terms of growth for the next couple of years and again, we are looking at this by global businesses. So and I will give you a detail by country within the global business in terms of growth and this is important. Retail will not grow much in the next year. 26 will see what happens to growth and revenues.', \"We are putting much more emphasis at least for now on profitability. We've grown 8 million customers. We're growing the top line not just because of the euro rates benefit this year but also because 8 million customers is a lot of customers. So again, given the context, our top line in retail will not grow as much in 25 within that there will be differences as I've said.\", 'If you look at within retail what are the countries that will grow more or less, I mean obviously in the euro area will grow less because of the impact but fees will grow to compensate partly and 50% of our businesses that are not retail will all grow the top line and the bottom line. Including consumer in the US and Europe. That is why I said the US will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower rates even I want to stress not as low as probably the market things.', \"I will let maybe also give some of the assumptions behind these numbers. In terms of NII in Spain and Portugal, let me go back again to the global business and I will tell you within that. So if you look at retail, you know, the countries that will grow will not be the European countries. Top line I'm saying profitability will be the same maybe a bit lower in some of them and higher in others within retail. Overall the retail and again the four big countries are roughly 70% of retail.\", \"The other 50% is not sensitive to higher rates. Sorry it's not rate sensitive but it does at least as well if not better again given the investments with the lower rate environment. For Spain, you can give the maybe the guidance for Spain which is one of the guidance we're going to give. Okay so let me very quickly go through the measures we've taken to decrease the interest sensitivity in the eurozone. We have taken three very important measures.\", 'One we have an alcoporfolio that has been created in the last year and a half. Right now in the eurozone we have a total of 67 billion euros of government bonds. The second we implemented hedges on the asset side of the balance sheet particularly mortgages through four war starts that go up to two years and we also increase the percentage of liabilities at variable rates.', \"With this if you look at NIA in Spain in the fourth quarter with which basically concentrates on the retail business you see a negative impact of around two percent from volumes and also margins that decreased around 17%. But this was compensated by the positive impacts of these measures that I just mentioned. Hedges added around a hundred million euros to NIA and the alcoporfolio around a hundred and eighty million euros to the NIA. That's why NIA in the quarter was basically flat.\", 'Going forward NIA in Spain again which is mostly and primarily concentrated in the retail business. If race stay and stabilize at around two percent we would expect to see NIA in Spain to drop between five to six percent next year. So that is the sensitivity. But let me let me reiterate again that we have decreased the percentage of assets and liabilities subject to rates in Spain. In December twenty two seventy percent of 76 percent of assets was floating.', 'Forty six of liabilities was floating. In December twenty four only sixty four percent of assets were floating and fifty one percent of liabilities were floating. So we decrease the sensitivity on the asset side while increase the sensitivity on the liability side. So we are much better prepared for lower rates. Thanks very much Jose. We have the next question please. Next question from the line of Carlos Pichoto from Kashabang please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good morning.', \"Thank you for bringing my question. I was on shift the question a bit to Mexico. So you had a relatively good performance in the in the quarter. I was wondering how do you see how do you expect a motion in terms of long volumes and also an NIA into 2025. You know, whether you have any sensitivity to any impact that potential tariffs which were not delayed for a month or less, let's see what happens there.\", 'Well, basically you have views on how could that affect overall activity in the country particularly in the global areas in the CIV business in Mexico, which by the way, if you could tell us how much it accounts for Mexico contribution to the interesting. And then just a small clarification on the on the on the capital organic generation that you mentioned before the 10 to 15 basis points per water.', \"I just wanted to understand the stats already net generation from net from off the regulatory impact to 60 basis points you mentioned or is that before the regulatory impact. Thank you very much. So again, let me just reiterate and I'll get to Mexico in a minute, but you know, we have significant business and geographic diversification Mexico like other countries is roughly 50%.\", 'I think probably between 45 to 55 is retail and the percentage of revenue and roughly also bottom line of Mexico when it reaches 12 and Mexico is around 15% of the total. So again, not a huge contribution on retail, which is going to be the one most sensitive to volumes. Half of our business and I let actor go into that in more detail is with corporates and affluent. We have a lot of high quality business in Mexico, actually the biggest opportunity is in the retail IE and the mass market.', 'We have also launched open bank there to take advantage of that and we have been very prudent in terms of our lending much more than other peers. We have focused of the last few months actually on the high quality segment. So clearly the Mexican economy could be more affected than others, but it should not have a significant impact on our expected delivery. So maybe you want to give a bit more color on Mexico.', \"I think just feeling very well and I mean the fact of the matter is that we have been, I would say prudent given the environment in Mexico. We've been growing a lot less than our competitors because we believe that it was important to be conservative. We are very much concentrated on going towards the part of the portfolio that has collateral.\", \"We've been concentrated a lot more on auto loans, on mortgages and we've been decreasing even though we have been growing in consumer, not as much as the rest of the market toy. Basically very comfortable of what are we doing there. And I believe that the ideal side I can give you, given that we are including a mild trade war, we're talking about Mexico in terms of revenue, up high single digits. And in terms of our rate between around 22% to 22% again, it's in constant nobion effects.\", \"Thank you. It's pretty regulatory charges. Thanks very much Jose. Can we have the next question please? Next question from the line of Trophy Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, this is the feedback from JP Morgan. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the guidance, I know you have now given guidance for net interest income in Spain that is going to be done for the sixth, third, third, third, third quarter.\", \"You gave guidance on a country by country level for net interest income. But that'd be possible to also get now for 2025. And then my second question would be, I knew you've mentioned that UK is the core part of us on the near but you focus on organic growth. But if you could talk about M&E, how you view your peers that are having involved in M&E, do you think that will change the European banking landscape and how these see something there?\", \"You have a lot of positions in landscape where you have more M&E and how you can evaluate any opportunities that are always stopped. But then she imports you gold and she is out there in Europe. So if you get comment on this, thank you. So we're going to give, just on your first question, thank you. We're not going to give detailed NII by country. We're going to give most of the countries and Jose can explain that.\", \"I'd like to go back to what we are committing and it's on the last slide or I think the last slide in the presentation. We have a revenue in euros 62 billion roughly the same as this year, mid-high single-digit growth and fees. And then by divisions, I think we have given also, you know, and I think Ektro has mentioned retail which is 50% of the group, flat revenues and more or less flat returns, consumer.\", \"So roughly 90% of that is Europe and the US revenues up mid single-digit and profitability improving significantly including in the US. Our corporate bank which is about 20% of our profits and 14% of our revenues revenues up profitability improving to 20% which is roughly what we said would be by this year. We're wealth 10% payments a big delta because of the restructuring so I think that is much more detailed with giving you and I think I don't, I cannot add much more on that.\", \"In terms of the UK and M&A, I want to say several things. First we do not need to buy or sell to allocate capital to the more interesting opportunities for Santanderciay holders where we combine, you know, profitability growth franchise and that's what we are doing in a very dynamic way across our footprint. In terms of how we think about this, I want to go back to what I said I think at the beginning of the call in terms of how we think about capital allocation.\", 'In a context where we anticipate excess capital given the higher profitability, we are being very strict and very disciplined. First we prioritize profitable organic growth and investments across our current footprint. Santander, this is how you should think of us. We are a compounder. We are going to compound earnings returns, book value and distributions. Second is ordinary dividends and distributions including buybacks. Third inorganic, let me just say this again.', 'It must be complementary to our strategic aims, generate attractive financial returns which means that they have to surpass those of organic investments or share buybacks. And then, and this is the first time in 10 years, we anticipate excess capital given our plans. I want to reiterate again, we are very, very good at predicting within a range of 2 to 3 percent on average the last 10 years actually you can go back more. Some of our shareholders know this.', 'Every quarter we have very little earnings volatility. This perception of volatility is not based on facts, it is based on perception. So again, any incremental capital that exceeds our target range operating, we are not actually sorry, that exceeds the other opportunities I just mentioned will be returned as additional remuneration. And that is how we think about inorganic. Let me just say that the framework in Europe is not there for cross-border M&A.', \"And that is why you are seeing some of our peers that don't have alternative profitable growth looking more at in market M&A. But that is not where we are. Can we have the next question please? Next question from the line of Antonio Real from Bank of America, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Just two questions from me please. So you've introduced this new commitment to pay 10 billion buybacks over 25 and 26.\", \"Now you've talked about shifting capital within the group rather than asset sales and this has been an important part of your strategy. Maybe can you talk a little bit more about that point to give us a sense of the flexibility that you retain to shift capital across the group, meet your profit guidance and still achieve the buyback commitment should the macro picture worse and just to get a sense of the flexibility that you retain there on the capital optimization.\", \"And the second point you've mentioned the group is highly diversified. You've given I think a very good overview of your expectations for 2025 across products. Can I go just go back to Brazil and could you share the same for the region? It's a relatively large share of your group and and it's a market focus region particularly dig more into the link between net interest margins, learn origination and affordability ultimately reflected in cost of risk for Brazil.\", \"And maybe the measures that you've put in place at your local unit to go through the cycling cycle, please thank you. So I mean just to give you some color on you know organic capital across the group so we started working on this 10 years ago we didn't have the tools to manage regulatory capital.\", \"We always very good at managing economic capital today we have a very dynamic capital allocation strategy so we shift on a weekly basis where we put more or less capital depending on the opportunities of course there's a franchise consideration. I mean you know why would we write lots of mortgages in Spain below 2% when I can get much better value in mortgages in Mexico.\", \"This is one of the reasons that giving guidance very specifically on countries is not something that we're very keen on because you know we will deliver at the group level and we're making more and more profits and increasing profitability because we are managing an economic way.\", \"We do not have a crystal ball right we don't know what the peers are going to do we don't know exactly what the rates are going to be so we manage this it reports through the chief investment officers to the CFO and to the CEO who are top down managing this with a global business and the countries.\", \"This is really the huge advantage you have with Santander 87% and we are you know prioritizing profitability ahead of growth but as I said 8 million customers new customers in the context of focusing on profitability can you imagine once we are at the levels and our operating platform is more competitive which it will be. We can have organic growth for many years to go so yes that is what we do every day that's I don't exaggerate but every week.\", \"So going back to that and I defer to actor or Jose but on Brazil I think we've said so you know Brazil as a country I think actor has said it but if not let me reiterate we expect revenue to go up and more or less stable returns.\", 'That is why we see Brazil but let me just be very clear that as I said before you know if you look at the retail business and how much of the retail business which is 50% and the most sensitive one to what rates might do or not you know retail Brazil is about 23% no retail Brazil is 23% of retail of the group right.', \"Half of the top line and the business of Brazil is not retail roughly and that is not sensitive to rates obviously cost of risk matters but that is something which we've also been diversifying so again Brazil should do about the same as this year in terms of profitability with higher revenues and the 50% that is not retail which is not right sensitive being one of the drivers in Brazil.\", \"Just to compliment what Anna said okay it's very important that Brazil is the place that you can see where we're changing the model in terms of NII being I mean being not the driver but actually being a feast the driver in the sense that we're doing things okay the positive fish is exactly what we're concentrated on we have changed a mix of the portfolio this base Mexico basically making us most resilient to rates.\", \"And has reduced the sensitivity to higher rates through the hatching we are 100% H for 25 on the PNL in Brazil so it's very important that you know that okay it's also important to tell you that the current deal coven stepping have a similar smaller impact and previous respected as I told you and as of December 100 basis point of or move on the Selic has an impact of around 120 million of NII so we're pretty much hedge all the structure is basically in place and we believe that on quality even though we remain vigilant over the past few years he has grown lending is lower than peers and we have tightening the underwriting criteria so the current economic forecast for GDP and grow to slow but we remain positive during the year.\", \"Cost of risk in another case scenario do changes on the portfolio we see the cost of risk to perform marginy little weaker than in 24 but really not changing the outlook for the overall cost of the risk this is exactly going back to what Anna was saying it doesn't impact the rest of the group is quite small and it doesn't change overall picture diversification is the essence in the group.\", \"Thanks very much actor since we're running out of time can we take the last two questions please so the next question please. Next question comes from the line of bitsmiths and autonomous this go ahead.\", 'Thank you very much for taking my questions just to make sure that we interpret the power garden correctly and timing I guess is relevant here you got to a 13% C.1 ratio after 50% ordinary payouts and 60 basis points of regulatory had wins and you would consider dropping below that with access distribution in 2025 but not to go below to a point five performer.', 'And then the second question is the sum was elegant on the DTA or DTC is rather why has the EECB not changed its view on this has anything been recorded in the Q4 C.1 and what is the maximum remaining risk here in an atlas decision what is the decision is maintained thank you.', \"Okay so let me just be clear we will not be below 13% this year intention is to operate at 13% but we are leaving ourselves flexibility depending on the capital hierarchy I described organic you know profitable growth which we're very keen to make sure we take advantage of distributions making sure that any in organic which we're not counting on for any of the distributions everything we're saying is.\", 'Organic growth organic distributions etc being more than buybacks etc so again we are aiming to be at 13% and have some flexibility going forward between the 12 and 13 being always above 12 which is where we are in terms of the let us answer the one on on the DTAs the reason we are contesting this is because we believe that you know level playing field and asset we are going to be able to do that.', \"So what is the problem which in Brazil is valid you know full claim against the government where other banks operating in the country US or local banks have a different treatment we think that does not make sense it's a question of principle the effect is not going to be much up or down.\", \"The the the the the the action of Brazilian monetizable DTAs from capital was already taken in the fourth quarter so if this ruling is is not in favor basically maintains ECB's interpretation they will not be impact they will be no impact on capital. Thanks very much was it very clear can we have the last question please. Last question from the line of the right from UBS please go ahead.\", \"I heard more and I'm taking for taking my question I've got to on the asset mobilization efforts the first one is you can give us some detail on the breakdown of those measures both from the geographical point of view and then sort of the long books basically you're using to accelerate and capital of the world. Capital optimization and second question is you have an internal limits in terms of how much you can do.\", 'And if you can see any regulatory constraints in terms of amounts actually you can do at some point in the future thank you. Thank you natural and the around the third of what we do is hedges one third is as a dispossals and a third more or less is as art is is synthetic.', 'So we do this in all geographies obviously synthetic secretization is mostly in developed economies in hard currency but the other strategies we are doing in all geographies as long as we are not the best tenors the best holders of some of the assets we originate and someone is willing to buy this assets below our cost of capital we will we will continue mobilizing the assets.', \"So this year the average cost of equity at which we mobilize the assets was around 8% compared with our cost of capital of whatever 14% of 15% of whatever so as long as that's the case we will continue to mobilize the assets now going forward as we optimize the back book most mobilization we will be related to the front book so you should expect to see a gradual reduction in the total amount because it will be mostly related related to the actual cost of capital.\", 'So we will be related to the front book no so much as is been the case so far to the back book. Thanks very much Jose with that we are we are the end of the Q&A session I will hand back to Anna to conclude. So thank you so much Raul thank you everybody I just want to reiterate we are only scratching the surface of our potential as a group.', 'We believe 2025 will be more challenging will be volatile we are preparing for things to be exciting even Rocky maybe at times this year and we are very confident that our strategy is working that our model is going to mean that we are going to do better than peers this year in what you know again we know is not going to be any see here so thank you again and see you soon.', 'This completes our call we look forward to catching up with all of you in our usual road shows and we will reach out to anybody who did not answer a managed to get asked a question separately offline as well thanks very much. You'], [\"Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2023.

Following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session.\", 'As a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star 5 on your phone. With this I will hand over to Mr. Grisi, Hector the floor is yours. Thank you Begonia. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First I will talk about our Q&A results within the context of the strategy we outlined our investor day.', 'Jose García will review our financial performance in greater detail and finally I will conclude with final remarks. Before we start let me briefly remark that during the first quarter the financial system has experienced situations we felt confirmed that our strategy and unique business model are key factors that allow us to deliver solid and resilient results. Many in times of market volatility as we have demonstrated today through our first quarter performance.', 'As we announced at the investor day we have entered a new phase of shareholder value creation. We are focused on my semaxime value creation aiming for the first time ever to deliver double GG growth in tangible net asset value per share plus dividend per share. With solid capital generation and efficient capital location that will allow us to improve our profitability and provide more return to our shareholders.', 'And we will achieve it thanks to first our unique combination of local leadership and our global scale and network that very few others can replicate. Our business model based on customer focus, a scale and diversification which provide us growth, cost and profitability competitive advantages which is underpined by an ambitious transformation plan that is already making Santa there a digital bank with branches. Today we delivered a solid Q1 with great progress in all our strategic objectives.', \"Tina ProZPS improved 5% in the quarter. A strong capital generation increase are fully loaded CET1 ratio to 12.2%. And discipline capital allocation improved the percentage of RWA's that create value and return on tangible equity reached an extraordinary 14.4%. In a difficult environment we are growing customers and volumes. The post it increased 6% year on year which are of a double digit revenue increase with good cost control.\", 'At the same time we have maintained very solid liquidity ratios as a result of our conservative financial management strategy and accredited quality of our immense stable with cost of risk well below our target in line with the medium low risk profile of our business. This strength resulted in a profit of 2.6 billion, the highest in the last 5 quarters, while profitability improved and we also delivered a strong capital generation.', 'Olinol were on track to reach our 2022 targets I will provide more details later. Moving on to the income statement. Firstly as we usually do we present growth rates both in euros and cost and euros. There was no material difference this quarter. Secondly in January we recorded a 224 million charge related to extraordinary banking tax on revenue in Spain. 202 million accounting in Spain and 22 million in DCB.', 'Excluding this impact profit rose 10% compared to the same quarter last year, 8% in cost and euros. Additionally we have positive and negative one of impacts in Brazil which do not affect profit. To better explain the business trends they have been netted in the underlying PNL. Jose will go in more detail on this. And thirdly the most notable movements in the quarter were strong top line performance supported by NII and higher fees supported by global and network businesses.', 'Costs have started the year in line with expectations growing one point below inflation. We demonstrated the sustainability of our results with double digit growth in net operating income which rose to 8 billion. From a creative quality perspective long lost provisions continue to normalize Jose will go into more detail on all these points later. This is a great start of the year.', 'Good business dynamics are translating into double digit revenue growth within an increasing year on year a close of regions and global businesses. We are implementing our one transformation project which is helping us improve efficiency ratio to within the range of 44 to 45% that we established for 2023 and which makes us one of the most efficient global lines in the world. Our cost or risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at the end of the year.', 'Our rating will quarter on quarter to 14.4%. If we do not analyze the story in our banking tax in line to which our year end target. And we generated capital equivalent to 17 basis points after having completed the second share by Vax program to reach a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In summary very positive trends which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters as we progressed towards the 2022 financial targets that we provided during our 2022 annual resource presentation.', \"As we announced at our investor in February we are building a digital bank with branches that makes our customers' lives easier. With processes and products there are simpler and more attractive to them. These together with a global network are helping us to improve the levels of our activity, revenues and cost. This approach combined with a discipline capital allocation are the cornerstone of our value creation model. Now I will dedicate some time to explain how we are progressing.\", 'Our customer focus is driving volume and revenue growth across the group. We are progressing well in the initiatives. That will help us to improve the way we serve our customers and let me explain some of the most relevant ones. We are also taking advantage of our network effect to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model that is growing at very high rates. Multilatinas and multi-Europeans are increasing revenue 53% and 72% year-on-year respectively.', 'We are also moving fast in the construction of our branch of the future to offer a best in class omni-channel experience across all the group. A good example of this is significant advances made in the digital and boarding processes in Mexico. We have a program that aims to better serve our customers through the use of data which targets 80% of our customer base.', 'It would help us to personalize our product offering, improve interaction with our customers and provide them with the best user experience. We have developed a common mobile app across Europe as a tactical solution while we implement the common front across all the group which is already live in Spain, Portugal and Poland and will be also released in the UK in the end of 2023.', \"Customer reception has been strong as I'm showing in Portugal where we have improved for number 5 to number 2 by customer satisfaction that this NPS through the mobile channel since the app was released. Our efforts to become a fully customer centric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers, loans, deposits and transactions per active customer at a very significant pace as shown on the right side of the slide.\", 'What customer focus is not enough, simplification and automation are also needed and we are making a good progress in simplifying our product offering and fully automating our front and back end operations. This is reflected in our leading position in efficiency and significant growth of 10% in net operating income per customer year and year. As we have discussed, one transformation is improving our local bank operations.', 'We are bringing our 160 million customers onto a common operating and business model while converging into a common technology. We are simplifying our product offering to improve our customer experience and reduce the cost. We also have already simplified our product catalog by 42% since we started the project two years ago. We are reducing also administrative and operational task and branches.', 'We aim to optimize around 80 to 90% of the overall customer related processes and we are progressing well. Spain, for example, has already optimized 40% of the processes in scope for 2023 and is expected to provide significant improvements. We are leveraging our global technology capabilities to accelerate digital transformation in Europe to make our processes fully digital and to end.', 'Finally, we are migrating our core banking system to the cloud, a project which we call gravity, making it more efficient, modern and scalable. This should result in the annual efficiencies of around 150 million upon full implementation with a 67% return on investment and a payback of three years. Overall progress at the group is at 30%. As we have completed gravity in Santa under UK for a corporate platform, migrations in CIB and Chile are expected to be concluded before the end of 23.', \"These are just a few examples of our ambitious transformation program that will bring Santa under operations to the next level. Moving to our global and agro businesses, the revenue is growing above the group average and already represents 39% of the group's total revenue. Several actions and initiatives to the revenue growth are already in full swing. CIB is still growing strongly after record highs in 2022.\", 'We are strengthening the centers of expertise with value-aldued products and services, developing global and regional platforms, focussings and on our areas of strength such as energy, transition, infrastructure or projects, trade finance among others. In the U.S., we are reinforcing CIB coverage teams, strengthening product capabilities and fully leveraging the integration of APS to expand our ability to distribute risk assets. World management and insurance revenue will 43% year-and-year.', 'We are working to maintain the positive trends by scaling up alternative and institutional products and promoting collaboration between World Management and CIB, offering private banking and asset management products and services to LCIV clients and vice versa. In Pagonex, which is also growing strongly, we have progressed with the migration of Santa under payments in Spain to our payments hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in Europe.', 'Our channel-acquiring expanded its innovative value of services which have reflected in 27% year-and-year growth in total payment volumes. Auto revenue fell affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in Scusa, as well as the negative sensitivity to interest rates. We have recently announced an agreement with F. Stellantis in Europe to become its key financing partner with SPIRT to increase the outstanding portfolio by 30% to 40 billion by 2026.', 'At the same time, we continue to leverage relationships with OEMs, importers and mobility providers to grow our businesses in North and South America. We further strengthen our relationship and capital position. Our overall risk profile remains medium low and is proving to be predictable based on our diversification. Cost of risk is to have 1.05%. Provisions continue to normalize year-and-year as suspected.', 'LLP performed well in the quarter as provision dropped 3% mainly driven by South America and North America. At the same time, we deliver strong capital generation. Our CET1 ratio reached 12.2% after having absorbed the full impacts from the Second Survive Act program and the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, Jose will provide more details in a moment. We will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and check hold of value creation on profitability.', 'As I mentioned earlier, our ROTE closed at 14.4% of 100 basis points in the quarter. If we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in Spain, ROTE would have been around 15.3%. Earnings per share grew to 15 cents, 11% higher than the 2022 quarterly average supported by strong profit growth and lower number of shares following the buyback programs.', 'Additionally, in the quarter we delivered 5% growth in shareholder value creation as our result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks. At current share prices, buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. We completed last Friday the second 2022 share buyback program having reported around 7% of our outstanding shares in the last two years which provides a return on investments of approximately 21% to our shareholders.', \"This results demonstrate that Santander has a strong model and risk management capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environments. Jose will go now into more detail on the group's performance in 2023. Please Jose. Thank you, Ector and good morning everyone. Following our CEO's presentation I will go into more detail on the group's P&L, risk profile and capital performance.\", 'Starting with the income statement, I will explain the account line by line in the following slides but let me make a few initial comments. As he has been mentioned, we had some one of results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in Brazil for 261 million, 211 million in NII and 50 million in tax recovery and two provisions made to strengthen the balance sheet totaling 474 million which net of taxes is 261 million.', 'So these movements had no impact on profit and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying P&L and ratios to facilitate comparisons with previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the year end guidelines we gave at the investor day. Additionally, the P&L includes the extraordinary banking tax in Spain which we did have an impact on attributable profit.', 'On the right hand side you can see the upward trend in profit quarter on quarter, 23% if we exclude the banking tax which was driven by top line growth. Going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in cost in euros, we maintain our strong revenue improvement.', 'In the first quarter revenue was 3% higher than in the fourth quarter of 22, 1.5 billion higher than in the first quarter of 22, boosted particularly by NII which increased 1.2 billion but also by fees almost 300 million more. We have a balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates mainly in Europe which coupled with healthy volume growth and an active margin management led to a strong NII improvement in the last few quarters.', 'Therefore, the first quarter 23 was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the Americas. We had good income growth supported by value added products and the network effect. Trading gains, a small portion of potato revenue rose driven by customer base CIB transactions and here is important to take into account that 97% of our CIV revenue is customer driven. Finally, other income increase as the fourth quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution.', 'Group NIA rose 14% year-on-year supported by volumes interest rate increases and manage management as I just said. In terms of volumes, loans were up year-on-year with double digit growth in DCB and South America. North America rose 6% and Europe was stable with falls in Spain and Portugal mainly driven by prepayments of mortgages to individuals. Overall loans grew 3% by backed by consumer and mortgages.', 'Likewise the deposits increased 6% with Europe growing 4% and South America, North America and DCB growing around 10%. I will go into more detail on our loan and the post-structure later. User rate hikes mainly benefited Europe, Mexico and the corporate center. The latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration. On the other hand, Brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products and Chile and DCB were affected by their negative sensitivity to interest rates.', 'Group net interest margin improved from 2.45% to 2.63% as we continued to actively manage our margins. We are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the repricing of loans. After the market movements at the beginning of the year, our deposit betas are on track with the numbers provided at investor day. So we expect this positive and eye performance to continue in 2023.', 'Turning to net fee income, it rose 7% year-on-year reaching more than 3 billion, which is explained by more customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking. CIB, which stood out with a 16% growth in all regions, but especially in Europe, very positive trends in Pagonext and Cards. And in wealth management and insurance, we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in asset management recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of 1.7 billion.', 'Finally, in Auto, volumes growth across the board continue. However, fee income in Europe was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany. The evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to be more capital light. Moving on to costs. The first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures, costs continued to increase below the rate of inflation. This was the case many in Europe, where costs in Spain, the UK and Portugal fell around 3% to 4% in real terms.', 'A salary is in Poland and Latin America tend to be more directly linked to changes in inflation. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%, having improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Outstanding performance in Europe, improving its efficiency ratio by 6% points year-on-year.', \"We will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets, and as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer, and as a result, continue to improve the net operating income per customer, as sector just explained. Credit quality remains robust, and the cost of risk is well under control. Lonelot's provisions grew year-on-year, driving the cost of risk to converge towards the through the cycle average as expected. The main changes by countries were the following.\", \"Improvement in the cost of risk in Spain and Mexico, credit normalization in the US, from the very low levels we saw in 2021 and in 2022, but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we thought. Poland increased its Lonelot's provisions, impacted by higher Swiss mortgage provisions. And finally in Brazil, we had higher Lonelot's provisions year-on-year on the back of individual consumer lending as well as overall portfolio growth.\", \"On a quarterly basis, Lonelot's provisions fell, and the three-month cost of risk in the quarter was 4.4%. This performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio. The non-performing loan ratio continued to improve, falling to 3.05% from 3.26% in March 2022. The main improvements came in Spain and DCB, in part due to portfolio sales in the period and as well as Mexico. The portfolio distribution by stages remained stable.\", 'On the right hand side, there is a brief overview of our Lonelot portfolio structure. One 80% of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets and if we look at the segments our mortgages have low average loan to values. The consumer lending portfolio is well-coloured, realized, short-term and has high returns. And the SME and corporate portfolio is well-covered as well as over 50% has guarantees. Finally a high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade.', \"We mainly comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate which is controlled and diversified across countries. Our exposure to Cree is 6% of total groups drawn and committed exposure. This is concentrated in the US, the UK and Spain, accounting for 75% of the total. Over half corresponds to social housing in the UK and multifamily in the US. The NPL ratio is 1.6% below the group's total NPL ratio.\", 'In the US we have a total of 21 billion of total drawn and committed exposure with an average loan to value of between 50 to 60%. Office Cree is just 2 billion and it has an occupancy rate of 92% compared with around 80% for the sector as a whole. Let me also go into more detail in Brazil and the US to countries that have raised some questions in the past quarters.', 'In Brazil the Brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years and interest rate hikes were implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages. This environment accelerated the credit cycle and increased cost of risk in 2022. From now on we expect interest rates to remain stable and probably start to come down after the summer.', 'Additionally, during the last few years we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally reduce our cost of risk. We have enhanced our cost of profile, the weight of new ventages with the best ratings has increased. We have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower risk, secure portfolios like mortgages, agro or payroll.', 'All in all given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and new lending profile, we expect to remain on target, excluding one of them in 2023, cost of risk should remain stable compared to 2022. Regarding the US, despite the bumpiest start of the year in the country the messages we gave at investor day have not changed. We expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout 2023 but remain below pre pandemic levels.', 'We have actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality, which was supported by a stable, used car prices and better late stage delinquency payments. Our focus in auto at the moment is on quality and profitability over volumes. Moreover, we were able to further increase the share of auto loans funded by deposits.', 'We have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity plays us in a very strong position to face very challenging scenarios. At the end of the quarter, our liquidity buffer, comprising high quality liquid assets, exceeded 300 billion, 97% of which were level 1 assets. Two thirds of this liquidity buffer is in cash, which is equivalent to 20% of our deposit base. Our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements.', 'The group LCR remained in line with year end at 152%, and the NSFR around 120%. The alcohol portfolio represents 6% of total assets, which is below industry average. The duration of the available for sale portfolio is very low and the current market of the whole health to collect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only 2% of our fully loaded CET1 capital.', 'This demonstrates that impact from the change of the value of our bomb portfolio on capital would be very limited even in a very adverse scenario. Customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core markets. These diversified and stable funding structures supported year-on-year growth as deposits rose with positive performances across almost all countries and segments.', 'The quarter-on-quarter decline in deposits balance in the deposit balances is explained by the seasonal drop in CIB clients deposits, while retail remains stable in the quarter. Some customers using savings to prepare mortgages given the rising interest rates in Europe. We have seen some flows from current accounts behind deposits and mutual funds. We have not seen any unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the travels of banks in the US and Europe.', 'In fact, we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in February and March of over 2 billion. Regarding capital, we ended the quarter at 12.2%. Let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter. 24 basis points of organic growth, which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter, partially offset by risk-wether as a growth. This includes a negative four basis point impact due to the extraordinary banking tax in Spain.', \"25 basis points drop from shareholder remuneration, which includes the total impact of the second 2022 share-by-back program, 15 basis points, and the accrual of the cash dividend, 10 basis points for the first quarter, taking into account a 50% payout. 11 basis points were related to the update of the regulatory framework, mainly following the EVA's clarification of its interpretation of city-1 minority interest calculation.\", 'And finally, a positive seven basis points from markets, basically available for sale. So we have increased our fully loaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, improved from book Rorwa to 2.8%, continued asset rotation, and increased the percentage of risk-wethered assets which deliver returns above the cost of equity.', 'All in all, a disciplined capital allocation, which combined with our model, gives us confidence in the sustainability of our commitment to remuneration to our shareholders. Now, I will hand it back to our CEO for the conclusions. Thank you. Thank you, Jose. To conclude the presentation and open the Q&A, I will briefly outline some final remarks the Arbition for the coming quarters.', 'Growth in customer volumes, robust revenue performance, double digit NII growth through even deposited sensitivity to ration rates in most countries, and customer margin management. Fee income grew at high single digits driven by our CIV payments and payment businesses. We expect this trend to continue the coming quarters, mainly in Europe and Mexico.', 'We are implementing our one transformation plan, our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and foster process automation and simplification supporting our efficiency improvements. We will accelerate one transformation further in the coming quarters. We have already identified business opportunities across a group which will enable us to maintain strong global and not-gror businesses revenue.', 'Finally, we have a solid balance sheet in sensor liquidity, solvency, and risk profile which will remain focused on maintaining a medium, low risk profile, and in capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio. So as we embark on our new strategy phase, all this plan should increase revenue and improve efficiency and profitability of our banks. With the overall aim of supporting circular de-ballucuation and sustainability in profitability.', 'As previous explained, our standing results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our 23 financial targets. However, we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated, depending on the evolution of the macro environment. We are convinced that we are going to achieve our 15%-rotate target, but probably through a higher contribution from Europe and Mexico and a potential global contribution from the US.', 'Finally, we are also optimistic regarding our medium-term targets that we announced at the investor day. As I told our shareholders at the annual general meeting, these targets are as specific and visions and achievable. We have the vision of what we want to go and the right strategy together. And we have the best team in place to put it in motion. So I am convinced that we will progress quarter by quarter to achieve our targets. Thank you very much. Thank you Jose Nektor.', 'We can start the Q&A session now. If you wish to ask the question, please press star 5 on your telephone. We already have the first question from Ignacio Largo from BNP Paribá. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two questions. The first one is on the outlook at group level for NII and fees. If I just look to one queue, you have met the guidance provided by the bank in investor day and for 2023 of double-g each revenue growth.', 'So as the year goes by, I think that that target gets challenged a bit. So I wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on where should we particularly on NII, where should see the acceleration coming. And based on the comments that you made at the Nektor, a bit of what would be the outlook for the US and III after the performance of the first quarter. The second one is on cost of risk. Have seen a decline in MPLs in Brazil.', \"Just wanted to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here in Brazil and whether we have seen a big NPL or it's just an assistile effect. Thank you. Okay. Hello, Ignacio. Thank you very much for your question. First of all, Assay basically this cost is quite important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we set at the investor day and also our guidance given that with the combination that the group is giving you. Okay.\", \"Assay is basically set. We're going to be a little lower in Brazil and the US and we will be much better in Europe and in Mexico. So it's quite important to understand exactly the combination and the work we manage in the group to get to the levels that we want. Okay. So Europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full 2000 and 23. Okay. Mexico should be up what we call low double digit. Okay.\", 'And we expect also, as I said, we can performance in a time with the exception of Mexico, the US and the DCB. The US is down mid single digits. DCB will be low single digits decline and Brazil is basically mid single digits growth back ended and we expect improvements towards the second half of the end towards the end of the year. Okay. On the cost of risk, I will have Jose basically give you some ideas. Yeah. I may compliment the NII in Europe.', \"We have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio obviously because as you know, mortgage is repriced every 12 months. So we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in Spain. Again, again, they are 12 months, you're either based and in Portugal is six months, you rival based. So we still have again a way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe.\", 'In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in 2023 relative to 2022, excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The 474 million provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-fourth for one-off cases, for specific cases, and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So in that sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean.', \"It excludes one of cases and it reflects the true as a quality evolution of the quarter. So for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of our individuals' portfolios because these are very short-time and obviously they, most of them, have matured already and we have been adding high-quality new ventages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector.\", 'So again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year. Thank you, Jose Nectar. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Francisco Rican, from Alanta. Please go ahead. Yes, hello. So I wanted to ask about following the recent turmoil in the sector. I wonder if you as a management have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk and or if your spectra and your regulatory changes in this front in general.', 'And more specifically, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more. Therefore, in the positive during the quarter, you mentioned season 18CIV, so you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarter and also you can update your guidance in terms of deposit pitas by the end of 2003. You were previously guiding for 25, 30 in Spain or 40, 15 in the UK, 50, about 15 in the US.', 'And just lastly, last question in terms of the alcohol portfolio in Spain, if you have changed your plans, you were aiming for 16 billion on average in 23 in terms of size, you are already above, passing the slides, so you can also update on this. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, I mean, given the turmoil and everything, I mean, the group is actually responding quite well, okay? We have seen all the levels in the deposits, basically, maintained themselves.', \"Individuals probably is the most important part in which 85 to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families, etc., which are basically very solid and very stable, okay? In that regard, also, I mean, with all these times, you always be prudent about how you manage things, but I can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical.\", \"The decrease in deposits was mainly in CIV, as we described, it was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio, and we expect, basically, to get them back and it's in the normal flow of the business, okay? In terms of the retas, I will have José give you a little bit of detail on that. So, back, in the first quarter, we had a drop of around 21 billion in CIV deposits in Europe, but that was seasonal.\", \"If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase, but again, this happens every quarter. This quarter was a bit more, a bit higher than in previous quarters, because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter. So associated, basically, with year-end balance sheet performance. So, this is not recurring, and this is seasonal, but again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits.\", \"We always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter to advantage of that. It's normalizing a bit in the first quarter of the year, but I would expect this seasonal behavior to happen every year. Beat us. Where are we? So, let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a in retail banking, beta today is 6%. Yield average yield is 22 basis points. In CIV, in Spain, European branches and global CIV, beta's are between 80 to 100%.\", 'So in Spain, if you look at the whole of a Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with a beta of 25%. And this is, we guided for the year between 25 to 30. We still, this will hold. Because again, most of the CIV business has already reprised, and we expect a slow increase in the reprising of retail banking. So still within the 25 to 30% for the year. US. Beta is 35%.', \"At the cost of 167, beta is a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher, and very much in line with the average of the system. In the UK, beta is 25%. And in the first quarter, beta's were 30 to 35. We guided to around 50% for the year. So we look at our inter-resensitivity relative to the figures we gave at investor day, very much in line with Europe and the US, and probably a better outlook in the UK. Finally, Alco. Yes, we expected more or less 16 billion average in Spain.\", 'We are already there. We might be a little bit about that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral. Alcoporfolio, we have a negative balance sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So actually buying an Alcoporfolio or rebuilding an Alcoporfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023. It is probably also a matter of 24 and even 2025.', 'So again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities. Thank you, Hector and Jose, and thank you, Paco, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Carlos Pesoto from Keisha Bank, please go ahead. Yes, I am Martin, thank you very much for taking my call. The question is correct.', 'So first question, what would actually be an II, and I am sorry if it is a bit of a recap on previous ones, but I was just wondering if you could give us the help of this for an II and both Brazil and the US. And I was also wondering if you could confirm just make sure that you have a, that there is a total of 210 million euros, one of course of the effects in Brazil and II in the water.', 'And then second question would be actually on on fees, and basically the discussion that we have is in the European level regarding needs and fees, I mean, with potentially rates. And also, if you have some visibility around potential amount of fees that could be impacted by working in this month by being introduced in European level. Thank you very much. Hi Carlos, Pagonia here, sorry to do this to you, but you need to repeat all of your questions.', \"The line was terrible, we couldn't understand the word here. So can you start again, maybe slightly slower and see if it goes better? So trying again, hopefully you'll hear me better. So as I was saying on NII, the question was really on the outlook for the US and Brazil, if you could recap it. And also I was asking to confirm whether it was 210 million euros, positive one off in the Brazilian NII, just to make sure that I got that number right.\", \"And then the second question was on the potential inducement bands in Europe. What type of impacts would such bands would have in fee income for some of them there? Okay, to give you, exactly, how do we see the NII? Okay, exactly the guidance we give is 211. Sorry about that, is that. So Brazil is mid single digit growth, we're talking 8.9 and then the US is 6.1 is down mid single digits, okay, that's exactly the number. Okay, thank you Carlos. Thank you Carlos for your questions.\", 'Can we have the next question please? Next question from Sophie Peterson for JP Morgan, please go ahead. Hi, here is the fee from JP Morgan, thanks for taking my question. I know there has been a lot of questions already on net interest income, but could you give a little bit more details around when you expect net interest income to peak in your core European markets? NII was bloody down in the UK, do you think you have seen peak NII and net interest income?', 'Well, got a lot on a quarterly basis, not improved further. And when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in Spain and when do you expect it to peak in Portugal? Then my second question would be around the cost of deposits in Mexico, they increased almost 1% quarter and quarter. Could you just detail what drew these increased think cost of deposits in Mexico?', \"And then my final question would be on core x with the tier 1, you saw 11 basis points of regulatory capital tailwinds in the first quarter. How should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come and could you give details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come? Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. Okay, really quick. I mean, as Jose was explaining you, in terms of NII, what we see in Europe, we still believe we're going to be.\", \"I mean, the majority of the portfolio will reprise in probably April and May. Okay, so the portfolio is still repressing. Are we going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at that time, probably to the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end. It's also is going to depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that. So in that sense, we'll see that in the UK, we're basically seeing things as stable.\", \"Okay, we basically see that we're still basically building up in the way that the portfolio is being going and also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year. Okay. Also, the terms of what you were talking about growth in the post-its in Mexico, you're right, is still lagging behind. Okay, the growth in costumers in Mexico is starting to pick what is important to do in Mexico, was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients.\", \"Okay, and that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete head to head against our competitors. So in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in Mexico in the following quarters given also the new payrolls that we have contracted. That are coming into the portfolio. Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive and we're also being focused on profitability.\", \"What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintaining our deposit base of individuals while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins. Okay, in terms of capital also, we'd like to comment. Yes, yes, so, Fias, you said we had the Q&A from the EVA was a positive 13 basis points. We had two basis points negative from other updates, model updates and regulatory updates basically in corporate investment banking.\", \"We would expect, I don't know, just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwings from regulatory and models for the rest of the year. Very, very small charges per quarter. In terms of organic capital generation, if you do a simple math in the first quarter, the share buy back corresponds to two quarters and we had the full impact of the Spanish tax, which was four basis points. So the first quarter only corresponded one.\", \"So if you do a, let's say, clean organic capital generation, we generated 10 basis points, 10 to 12 basis points in the quarter, which is what we have always said. We, you know, organically generate 10 to 15 basis points per quarter and that's what we expect for the rest of the year. Thank you and thank you so if you have any questions, can we have the next question please? Next question from Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\", \"I've got one in the US on wine and Spain. The wine in the US is if you can elaborate a little bit on the coastal risk drivers in the future, breaking it down between probability of default, loss given default. What kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increase in installments on the auto business in particular for clients? That gives you comfort basically that again, provisions are not going to go above a pre-COVID levels.\", \"And the one in Spain is you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between retail corporate and large corporate and what kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments from a customer point of view how pushy, especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of chasing additional remuneration. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Let me explain exactly what's going on in the US.\", \"In terms of coastal risk, we expect the coastal risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit, some of the vintage on 22 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see that normally when you see customers in those vintage, this started to get the link for more than 90 days. Usually we repossess between 90 and 95% of the autos.\", \"What's been happening and it's been quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going the link went beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us, restructuring and start paying us back. So we have seen a decrease of reposs from around 90 to 95% or around 59 to 60%. That's basically 30 points. That's why you see the cost of risk is getting much better in the US.\", \"To your question, basically, of going back to pre-covid levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio. We have a lot more in-soup prime and deep-soup prime. Today we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and near prime in the business. That's why the portfolio is never going to go back to the level-sale hat. Also, in 19, we have bluestem. If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in 2021.\", \"That was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk. That's another part of that portfolio is actually much better because of that. In that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the US, even though it's normalizing because it's going back to pre-covid levels, it's not going to be as that that is used to be, but it's much better than we expected at the beginning to conclude. In terms of the break down in deposits, I don't know how soon you would like to... Spain?\", \"In Spain, the Spanish business, we have 246 billion in deposits. Individuals and SMEs is 229 billion, corporate clients, 18 billion. When we look at the public perimeter, that includes the branches and CIV in the branches, we have 15 billion and in global corporate investment banking, 38 billion for the total is what you see in the accounts of 300 and 1 billion. Thank you. That's right. Thank you, and thank you, Nacho, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\", \"Hi, thank you for the presentation. Just a couple of questions, because most of the doubts have been cleared. On the UK, we've seen how a cost of the deposit house is starting to accelerate. If you could elaborate a little bit on the structural head, and when do you foresee the peak net interesting? Because you've said this year is going to be more of a flatish NII if I understood correctly.\", \"Does it mean that we still have to see the benefits of the structural head going forward in 24 and 25 or how do you expect NII to combine competitive dynamics and the structural head upside? The second one, if you could just explain a little bit better, what was this change in the EBA criteria to have that positive impact on capital? Just understand the rational. Thank you very much. OK, I'll take the two of them. Let me answer the second one first, which is CC.\", \"What basically the EBA has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate. So obviously if capital is eventually used, let's say Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in ReIS, not in Euros. So before these, the interpretation was that a capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate. And now obviously because the capital will be used in local currency, that doesn't need to be adjusted.\", \"That's a net between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negative in some countries like Mexico, where the currency has appreciated net net 13 basis points. OK, so in the UK, we still have around 100 billion structural positions, which will help NII going forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year, more or less, around 5%. So volumes a bit down in the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates. And we still think rates might go up a little bit.\", \"So we would expect NII to go up, meet single digits, probably a bit more than meet single digits. So that's the expectation for this year in the UK. Thank you Carlos. Thank you Carlos for your questions. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from City. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the NII from your Euro balance sheet.\", 'The problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult to track your NII performance. And compare it with your peers. So you guided at the capital markets day that you would make 1.7 billion of extra NII in the Euro balance sheet this year with a curve at the time. Could you please update that number today and how it breaks down between Spain, the corporate center, the digital bank, all their Europe and Portugal.', 'The second question is on the US deposit. That was one of your expanding your deposit base was one of the pillars of your plans and possibility there. That is now becoming more and more expensive. Where do you see the cost of deposits in the US by year end? And what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able to raise the deposits without having to pay much more than your competition?', \"And just a quick one, if you could update us on the UK or what do you see for mortgage margins please. Thank you. I'll take the first one. Marta, I will get back to you with a breakdown. Basically, it's all a Euro balance sheet. It's not that difficult to do the sensitivity, but I will get back to you. The sensitivity remains the same. Remember we said 1.7 billion using the forward curve rates as of December. In the first quarter, the curves have remained.\", 'After having moved up and down, they are basically where they were at the end of December. So we would still expect, for the next 12 months, a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter. And in line with that guidance we gave, because as Ektor explained, we would see the reprecation of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year. Thank you, Jose. Okay, let me tell you, Marta, about the US deposits.', 'The US basically accumulated beta has reached around 35%, and the cost is around 1.67%. Okay? The high interest rates reflected on the saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits. What I can tell you is the majority of the deposits in the US basically is individuals. The bulk of them. And they have proven themselves very stable. We have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side.', \"We have seen a little bit of movements in the mid-corporate, which we are basically diversifying the deposits, but nothing material in that sense. Okay, what is important to tell you is that we don't foresee really high increases on that. I mean, there is a lot of competition in the market, but our deposit base has been even with this situation maintained itself very stable.\", \"So we don't foresee that we're going to have a huge increase even with a competition from some others, players that we have seen in the market. And we are not changing our assumptions at this time in the way we see the deposits in the US. Okay? The final question is UK mortgage margins. Yeah, the margins for that specific business are under pressure. We would expect a slightly weaker margins in the mortgage business going forward.\", 'We are, right now we have a market share of 11.3% when we look at stock mortgages in the UK, but when you look at the first quarter, we have originated on average around 6 or 7% of the market because we are focusing on only on high quality mortgages that obviously have a slightly lower margins. But again, the combination of all our structural position volume growth and margin management in the UK should lead to me to highest single digits in NII in 2023.', 'Thank you and thank you, Marta, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Andrea Friedtri from Mediwanka, please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I have one question and two quick clarifications. The first is essentially if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided and we just very basically add up to the end of the year, we would reach 11 billion profits in 2023 when consensus is well below that.', \"Where do you see consensus being too conservative on the estimates for 2023? And the two clarifications, the first is on Brazilian Costa Rizca. You indicated a flatish evolution excluding one of us. I just want to make sure I understood correctly that the 424 million charged on provisions of this quarter is not a one-off. And so the guidance you're giving is 4.4 to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023. The second is again, the guidance you have given before.\", \"I didn't understand if it was related to NII growth or volumes when you said Mexico, up double digit, US, down, mid single digit and Brazil, up, low single digit. Thank you. OK, so let me take consensus and Costa Rizca in Brazil and I will try to clarify that. What is consensus below where we think we might be? I think we are a bit more constructive on fees and I think the first quarter shows very good performance of fees, basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses.\", \"You've seen in the presentation that our global businesses, CIB, with management, PaganEx, are doing very, very well. Also cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 105 in the first quarter. Probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So those I think are the two, this is a bit on NII but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So generally I think it's provisions and fees. Cost of risk in Brazil.\", \"So the 474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in Brazil around one fourth of that for one of cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in Brazil. So the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs for specific cases.\", \"From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 1375 until after the summer, probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector. But by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with 2022, excluding the one-off, which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think that clarifies my comments.\", 'And then on Mexico? Yeah, on Mexico I can tell you is that you are going to see very good growth in terms of NII because of your positive in the sensitivity there. Also what you are going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees because we are growing clients in a very good way. Mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers. Also CIV is an important driver of fees. And also you are going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much under control.', 'So you are going to see an only not very good performance in the country, given that particular situation and also that economic situation in the country is doing very well. Thank you and thank you Andrea for your questions. Can we have the next question please? Yes, I have a question from Beatrice Smith from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi there. Good morning. I have got a couple of questions on the deposit development in Spain that decline.', 'Can you maybe split the trends between corporate and retail deposits there? And also a question of what are the costs of deposits in Spain? There was quite a meaningful increase Q on Q. Do you swap any of your deposit base and is that included in the number? And then lastly of course there was also loan-hield expansion regarding the management of your net interest income in Spain. Do you look more at the customer spread or do you look at the individual costing of the balance sheet?', \"And then a couple of follow-ups on Brazil could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one of those around 460, 470 basis points are things. Another question on the Polish FX saga. Do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish spring more gorgeous? And lastly one question on the regulatory outlook. Do you expect there to be any rethink other in Spain or on a global level of deposit insurance charges and the funding of deposit insurance funds? Thank you.\", \"Okay. So the deposits in Spain, as I said, 21, 22 billion drop from corporate deposits, flat, slightly down retail deposits in the quarter. Basically when you look at early mortgage repayments, they are very much aligned. So Annie, we look at February and March, as I mentioned, positive trends in both retail and corporate deposits because again, the 21 billion drop was associated with the year and balance sheets of our corporate deposits. I'm not sure I understood your second question well.\", \"Your question was if we swap deposits or... No, we don't. Obviously, no, no, we don't swap the deposits. We manage net interest income, sorry, interest risk through the asset side, not through the liability side. How do we manage NIA if I understand correctly? Do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that?\", \"I don't understand where your question, but obviously again, interest rate risk management is mostly managed through the asset side and we look at the overall net interest margin of our interest earnings assets. Brazil, the cost of risk... Basically, it's around 4.58 percent and excluding the one of that we had, okay? And that's... And in terms of the mortgages that you ask for Poland, up to now, the portfolio basically is 48 percent reserved, okay?\", \"That's exactly and we are actually looking at what we're going to do depending on how the portfolio evolves, okay? And we are now 48 percent coverage of the total portfolio. Thank you and thank you, Bridget, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, very quickly, hopefully. Two questions for me on provisions on the US.\", \"I know you touched on an earlier question on it, but I just wanted to understand the car price is so far being better, it's certainly year to date. And if you look at your surgesization data, that's also doing slightly better in the MPLs or down. So why didn't the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter didn't go down as much? Is there a lag effect here? How quickly do the second hand car prices feed into the model? Maybe some hand holding there.\", \"And I don't know if you could be more specific on your updated views for a year, cost of risk in the US. And on Brazil, I don't know if you've touched on this, but should we expect any more top ups or one-offs in Brazil beyond the recurrent cost of risk that you will rate touched on? Thanks. Alvaro, in the provisions on the US, okay, it's very important that you understand that. I already explained exactly how the vintage is performing.\", \"The previous vintage is basically performing quite well, okay? The thing is, there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS, okay?\", \"IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of the fault that was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in the US because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? When you turn that portfolio to IFRS, the NOV, the new definition of the fault basically requires you to create a lot more provisions, even though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly because it's quite complicated.\", \"So what I'm trying to tell you that IFRS does not pre-be, I mean, sees that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs, okay? So normally, a portfolio in Europe, beyond 90 days, etc., would be, I mean, would go for reposition.\", \"A portfolio in the US is not performing exactly like that, is actually, beyond 90 days is performing much better and the client might pay you one installment, two installments, then would pay you not to pay you one installment and there would pay again, etc., okay? So that's why you see those differences and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though you write car prices are better than much better than we expected and the mind-hime is actually at better levels.\", \"At the end cost of risk in the US is going to be around 2%. Okay? It's exactly what we think. And in terms of, yeah, 3% compared with pre-pandemic, all right? So as we were saying, it will gradually normalize, but it is actually performing a little bit better this year and it will not reach pre-pandemic levels because of the change in the mix that the director was referring to. But this year we would expect it to be around 2%. Okay.\", \"And in terms of Brazil is exactly Alvaro as José Jose is playing you. It's in Brazil at around 13.75%. Okay? Inflation is actually just below 7%. What José was explaining you, if the rates continue to be that way, there might be the possibility that some of the big corporates or medium-sized corporates start to suffer. Okay? We don't see that individual portfolio with suffer because it's shorter term, it's managing a different well and is a little bit inelastic to the rates.\", 'But the corporate portfolio in the mid-corporates mainly and SMEs could suffer because of that. But at the same time, individuals is improving and you can see that actually in the first quarter cost of risk isolated at 4.4% because we are growing in high quality retail loans and the old ventages are maturing very, very quickly.', \"So even with that possible and we don't know, but it might happen possible deterioration in the cost of risk in the corporate sector, we would still expect to be in line with a guideline that we gave at investor day for a flat cost of risk year-on-year excluding one-offs. And no, the answer is no, we don't expect any significant one-offs for the rest of the year. Thank you. And thank you, Alvaro, for your questions. Can we have the last question, please?\", \"Next question from Fernando Gil de Santibanes from Best Inversocurities, please go ahead. All right. Thank you very much. We'll take you in my question. Just to quickly go in on liquidity and LCR ratios. How do you see the year in LCR ratios at a group level, Spain, Portugal and the U.S. States? And can you please remind us of the TLTR or Materials that have been passed? Thank you very much. TLTR or? No, okay. So, no, the LCRs. Very difficult to predict.\", 'Around 130 to 140 in every unit at least. For the group, it might be a bit higher than that because of the liquidity of the corporate center. But when we look at specific units, 130 or above. TLTR or we have 25 billion left. So we have rebate 65 billion. This 25 billion will mature gradually until 2024. The 25 billion, 4 billion in Santa and Spain, 18 billion in Santa and their consumer finance and 3 billion in Portugal. Thank you. And thank you for your questions.', 'Thank you all for your attendance. Santa and their investor relations team. Is it your disposal for any and all questions that you may have? Thank you, everybody. Thank you.'], [\"Good morning, everybody. To Banco Santander's conference call, to discuss our financial results for the first half of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektor Grisi, and our CFO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session.\", 'If you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Ektor, the floor is yours. Thank you, Regonia. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let me share what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our half one results on the context of how we are progressing with the strategy. We outline our investor day.', 'José will then review your financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with a few closing remarks. Despite the challenges, the financial system experiences at the beginning of the year, you too was another strong quarter for Santander, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our strategy and unique business model, even in times of market volatility.', \"We delivered a record profit of 2.7 billion, an increase of 14% compared with Q2 in 22, that's plus 17% in cost and euros. In the first half of 23, profit was 5.2 billion, of 7% supported by robust customer revenue growth. Revenue increased double-deeds year-end year, supported by all regions and global businesses. Global and network businesses are continuing around 40% of total group revenue.\", 'Our numbers of customers grew by 9 million year-end year, taking the total to 164 million, and loans increased by 1% and deposits by 5%. The group continues progressing towards a simpler and more integrated model through one transformation. The program that is accelerating our structural model changed to our efficiency improvement and growth in profitability. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.3% at each point year-end year to 44.2% and our net operating income were double-deeds.', 'On return on tangible equity, Rote rose 80 basis points year-end year to 14.5%, while our earnings per shares improved 13% year-end year-end year, supported by greater profit and share buybacks. At the same time, our strong balance sheet with solid and sound capital ratio, liquidity at comfortable levels and robust credit quality, contributed to solid profit of growth, value creation and shareholder remuneration.', 'These results allow us to deliver value creation in terms of TNAB plus DPS year-on-year of 11% of which represents an increase of more than 6 billion in the first six months of the year. Moving on to the income statement, firstly, remember that as we usually do we are presenting growth rates, both in current year and constant year-end. This quarter there was no material difference between them.', 'As I have just mentioned, profit increase in the first half supported by, first of all, a strong line performance with all the regions and global businesses growing, costing line with our expectations growing 1% point below the rate of inflation, double-deed growth in net operating income to approximately 16 billion, which demonstrates the strength of our results and low-loss provisions normalizing in land with our expectations.', 'These trends resulted in our high-square-tally profit on record, 4% higher than on Q1, even after the following impacts net of taxes recorded in Q2. The S-RF contribution of more than 200 million and additional Swiss Mortgage provisions in Poland of 140 million and one of Symbrasil of 137 million. Jose will go into more detail on all of these points later on. This was a great first half that makes us confident that we will deliver our 2,023 targets.', \"Good business dynamics are rotating into double-deed revenue growth, our efficiency ratio improved as a result of good cost control and revenue trends, our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at your end. C-E-T-1 was 12.2 after profitably growing our businesses organically and at the comfort level, allowing us to accrue funds to meet our shareholders' remuneration targets of a 50% payout.\", \"Our rotate also grew year-on-year to 14.5 on track to reach our target and would already be close to 15% if we don't analyze extraordinary banking tax on revenue earned in Spain. As we announced at our investor day, we have entered into a new phase of value creation that will help us grow a T-NAP per share plus DPS at a double digits or through the cycle.\", \"I'd like to spend a couple of minutes updating you on the progress of our transformation plan now that we are six months down the road from our investor day. We are transforming the banking the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue.\", 'We are making great progress in the implementation of one transformation, creating a common operating model and technology for our retail business across our entire footprint, to better several customers and to improve efficiency and increase the size and profitability of our customer base. We are delivering across the three pillars of one transformation. In simplification, we already have reduced 5% our number of products, nearly 400 fewer products in 2023.', 'We are progressing in our digital sales service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact center by 17% just along the first quarter of 23 compared with the same period last year. We are digitalizing the onboarding process in 2020 Mexico. This initial pilot has resulted in a 36% growth in digital accounts per month compared to those in 2022.', 'And we have already captured around 70 million in savings so far in the U.S. from transformation and simplification initiatives. As you can see on the slide, the initial efficiencies for one transformation and the impact of our goodest-prone management in a context of higher rates, higher interest rates, which our CFO will cover later in depth, have already contributed 85 basis points in efficiency improvements.', 'Our global and network business keep continuing contributing to the growth profitability and have already delivered another 43 basis points.

In auto, we are increasing managing OEMs and retail relationships globally, expanding our partnerships in Europe to Latin and the US.', 'We have recently onboarded new partners in the USA, in the US, leveraged existing agreements in Europe which are expected to materialize in around 4 billion of new business per year. We have also deployed a new-parent regional listing platform in two markets and more countries will be added throughout 23 and 24. Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in 36 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio.', 'Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 80 million in savings this year mainly driven by one. Efficiency is from the recent development and deployment of gravity in three countries which has contributed with 31 million in savings in the first half. The new global agreements with vendors which represent around 40 million in cost reduction year to date.', 'The actions that we are beginning to carry out as a part of one transformation, which we are expanding across the group are starting to be reflected on cost and non-apparational efficiencies. As you can see on the slide, simplification has already driven significant improvements in our cost and revenue-practic cost-emorations.', 'The solid progress we are making with the process digitalization and automation to capture efficiencies enables us to spend less time on operations in branches and turn the branch network into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Portugal has already taken out most of the operational activities from the branches, freeing up branch employees so that they can spend more time supporting customers and commercial activities. We are extrapolating this to other of our ranks.', 'In only six months through one transformation we have already reduced the number of operational FTEs per million customers by 3%.

Revenue at the copper center also improved up nearly 400 million due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from ethics hedging which negatively affected revenue last year.\", 'Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI which continued its upward trend increasing 6% in the quarter alone driven in particular by Europe. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. First half 2023 was 15% higher year-on-year in constant euros with positive sensitivity to racing rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in auto North America and South America which more than offset negative interest rates sensitivity in Brazil, Chile and auto.', \"In terms of profitability we have improved our margins every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. We continue to actively manage our great spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. Gains on credit yields outweighed higher funding costs thanks to our discipline the positive remuneration strategy adapted to each country's specific needs.\", 'In Europe we are strictly managing the positive costs, especially in Spain and Portugal where there is excess liquidity in the system and much lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment in line with our expectations. In Latin the positive rates are more directly linked to market interest rates which implies negative sensitivity and will benefit margins when rates start to decline over the next few months.', 'Finally in the US the positive betas are higher due to the heightened competition following the collapse of Silicon Valley bank.

The non-performing-on ratio remains stable in the context of unexpected soft landing and strong labor markets as an employment is a key driver of credit quality.

Let's open the Q&A session please. So as the question, please press star five on your telephone.\", \"We already have the first question from Carlos Pichoto from Tasha Bank BPI. Please do ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call with my question. First question would actually be on Brazil. Margin stabilized quarter on quarter is still a bit under pressure year on year. I was wondering what the evolution you expect for the rest of the year and also on cost of risk, what's the outlook there. Then the second question would actually be on capital.\", \"So basically the capital generation in this quarter was only three raises points a bit below the run rate. You have discussed in previous quarters. I reckon that this partially has to do with the maximum minorities in corporation but I was wondering how do you see this evolving throughout the rest of the year and also what is behind the increase in RWAs in this quarter. Thank you very much. Thank you Carlos. What I'll do is I'll ask the first question on Brazil.\", \"We'll give a comment on capital and then Jose will tell you a little bit about what's going on with increasing RWA. In terms of the Brazil margin quarter on quarter as we say basically is explained by the following. On loans since 2021 we have become much more conservative and growth and grown volumes very selectively changing the loan mix to lower risk. So we mainly get a variety of credit cards going on to a consignado, auto loans and mortgages.\", 'On the posits also the fast increasing rates has meant a rapid rise in the cost of the posits as well as a change of the mix on the deposits. Rates are staying higher for longer has prevented that the cost of the deposit from coming down impacting NII. Remember that in Brazil we have negative sensitivity to rates. OK. So Brazil NII in the second quarter of 23 is already flat.', 'OK. As we said and Jose was very precise on that the worst since behind us and we are already seeing a reduction on the average cost of the posits and we also see an improved cost of spread. OK. So we expect NII in the second half of 23 to be higher than the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year without substantial improvement in 24. OK.', \"In terms of the cost of risk not only the macro outlook is improving but since 21 IASI explained we've been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate cost of sales as I explained. OK. This is showing what results and we believe the worst as I said repeatedly is worst. Sorry, the worst is behind now.\", \"Cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving versus the first quarter and the vintage are showing really good performance as we have seen. So we don't expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in Brazil in 23 versus 22 excluding the one off that will be which implies staying close to around 4.6%.\", \"OK. And then to be on capital to be very precise we expect to generate at least 10 basis points of organic capital on average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place. As a result we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12%. Even when the final implementation of Basel 3 comes into effect on January 1st on 25. OK. And with that I don't know how if you can comment on RWAs please. Thank you. So morning Carlos you're right.\", 'Long growth was zero but resuited assets grew more or less 2% half of that growth is due to effects. As we consolidate the Latin America basically the peso and the Brazilian based assets into the group of the other half half of the other half so a substantial amount corresponds to a stock finance. And this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in Europe and this will eventually translate into auto loans.', \"So this is obviously short term that will eventually lead higher profitability going forward. When we look at the outlook as a sector said we don't expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital impacts in the second half of the year. We see no in organic charges in the second half of the year. Obviously it looks like the available for sale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable.\", 'We see improving profitability as we have mentioned particularly driven by higher NIA in the second half and resuited assets that should be probably under under control. So net net we see a stronger capital organic capital generation in the next couple of quarters again leading to a capital that will remain well above 12% every quarter and building up sufficient capital to be above 12% post-passal 3. Thank you Hector and of course I can have the next question please.', 'Next question from Ivaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions please from my side on US and Spain. US has obviously done much better in provisions.', \"I know you've touched on it Hector but maybe you can give a bit more detail as to why the provision was so low in the quarter is it's collateral is it default rates and when you think about the rest of the year maybe you can update us about the guidance what do you expect in cost of risk for the full year I think you gave us some coloring Q1 maybe an updated view or the moving parts there. And second question on Spain it deposits much more stable this quarter previous quarter.\", \"I wonder if if you can give again a bit more color on the deposit migration remuneration and when do you what you expect and I like to peak in Spain. I'm extrapolating Spain Portugal but I assume it's the same dynamics thank you. Thank you Ivaro. Okay let me give you a look in the US okay and I explained it it's basically the same dynamic I explained you on the first quarter okay.\", 'Credit provision as you know the increased as credit quality is remaining robust and credit near charge of actually what we called realized losses show better than anticipated performance and this is basically on the back just prices continue to be strong okay as I explain and declining at slower pace that we previously anticipated.', 'The change in auto-lone sport of volume mixed over small prime remember that I told you that before 2019 we had a lot more so prime than prime and they change on the mix has also we have robust and better than expected labor market in the US okay which is sustaining that okay and auto-customers that are the link went exactly as I was explaining the first quarter for more than 90 days are rolling into charge of status at historical low levels okay.', \"Normally they were above 90 95 percent last quarter they were around 59 percent this quarter around 67 percent okay so it's still much better than we we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID okay and in that in 2023 we expect cost of risk to continue the normalization at around 2 percent and after two years of artificially low figures giving COVID etc as I was saying normalize levels should be below pre-pandemic cost of risk at around if remember pre-pandemic was around 285 it's never gonna get there okay because of the change of mix and what I was explaining okay in terms of the Spain okay in Spain the deposits I mean continue to be stable okay at around 200 we have around 299 billion okay we have excess liquidity in Santa and their Spain to the LTD is around 78 percent as this is the case for the whole Spanish system that is around 80 percent quarterly the claim is more you most link to CIV deposits flat in retail in the quarter despite the earlier repayments of mortgages okay it's 60 percent compared to the same period of 2022 and the increased volume of deposits moving of balance sheet products also what we see between the first half of 23 versus the first half of 22 is plus 0.9 percent okay so we have a different change of the mix with time deposits going up at around 61 percent up year and year while the mandiposis are going down around 5 percent on the back of the higher rates given by the growth of CIV which allows us to maintain also our and maintain a stable net liquidity position okay in terms of what I was saying NIA we don't expect expect to pick yet I mean we have still revisions and I will have host explained in detail exactly how we see NIA evolution in Spain morning Alvaro let me let me talk about the corporate center because and they say more than than Spain because this is going to give you a better a better view of our euro sensitivity to rates in Spain so we have assets of 330 billion 60 percent floating 40 percent fixed this fixed includes the alcohol which is 27 billion that we've been buying recently with an average duration of six years and an interest rate of over 3 percent we also have intragroup transactions etc money markets that are fixed but these are very short them so they will reprise a short term your IBOR actually goes up of the floating 200 billion 65 billion will reprise or reprises with 12 month Uribe or we expect the if we use today's 12 month Uribe or compare with the average of the first half so let's assume that the Uribe remains flat in the first half of next year we have at least 50 basis points pick up in the reprising of this part of the portfolio next year and then we have 60 sorry 30 billion with reprises with the six months 40 billion with the three months and 65 billion with one month so we will still expect significant reprising upwards in the first half of next year as interest rates in Europe may may go up once or twice but as they stabilize we will still have significant reprising of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year so obviously the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024 obviously margins will depend on the cost of deposits but we as a sector said we are not seeing any pressures today to increase the remuneration of retail deposits we are already paying almost Uribe or for CIB deposits institutional deposits but we don't see any pressures on the retail side of the deposits which means that probably the picking net interest margins will not happen until well into 2024 in the eurozone thank you all but a few questions and Jose and act of the answers can we have the next question well but the next question please come on I wanted to ask about NII in the UK and in the US if you can please update you guidance in the UK I see lending is weak falling local mortgage market is declining asset spreads at low the deposit bit I see still relatively low how do you see all this then I'm going forward and NII and also in the US you are gaining market share but are you gaining new clients or are you paying for deposits how do you see the the bit compared to the local peers and also in absolute transport and NII there in the US thank you thank you Francisco okay let me give you the details okay in the let's talk about first about the UK NII was up double digit in the first half of 23 okay it was driven mainly by higher rates and the strong focus on money in spreads and profitability although the UK tends to be more competitive than other Europeans markets as you know okay so we're putting profitability ahead of market share okay and we have a lower risk appetite but we're expecting good performance to continue leading to and nimespension okay so we expect it to stabilize towards the second half okay to end 23 with a high single digit growth on higher rates and despite the lower volumes that we have because of why you just explained about profitability okay in the second quarter NII was flatish okay higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slow down in new regions okay in terms of the betas Jose will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the US in terms of the US overall as you have seen has one better than expected even the change of mix towards prime okay as I explained in detail lower yield but also better risk profile and the lower credit provisioning is helping us okay NII is flatish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale retail as you know a lot of this is funded by wholesale as well and a common trend occurs sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have sometimes the US betas are a bobbler we expected more lower than the average of our peers just to give you exactly what's going on and we expect NII to be down mid single digit on lower regions nations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers however given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half the US NII could do better than we expect okay US NII is not the only one that has on better cost of risk and profitability are also better than expected in the country okay so Jose I don't know you can comment on the betas please in the UK when we look at the coastal deposits today relative to the level of rates today that's around slightly below 30% is increasing slightly in the quarter three percentage points we still think that I will continue so the UK is a market with less excess liquidity than Spain for instance and so we would expect as sector said margins probably there was stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flatish in the third and probably slightly going down from there in the US as sector said we kept our deposits flat paying less than our regional bank competitors the beta in the US is 36.8% up to percentage points quarter on quarter so after the spike that we saw in February March the betas in the US have remained very stable and we are actually increasing the deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors thank you Paco can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Largif from BMP Pariba XM please go ahead thanks very much for taking my questions I have two questions one is on the Spanish long book you could update a bit on the trends that we have seen in the quarter here in Geraintus here in a percent decline if you could elaborate a bit on what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward and the second question is a bit at a group level if I just look to the first half course of risk is around 106 basis points you are sticking to the guidance below 120 and is there any region besides the US what we could see some deterioration in the second half that makes it keep that conservative guidance which would imply a round rate of around 135 basis points 140 basis points in the second half to make 120 thank you thank you Ignacio let me tell you a little bit about what's the dynamics on the on the Spanish long book and then also we'll talk about your second question okay in the Spanish long book the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear okay we have seen low the amount of credit okay which is impacting us a little bit mainly also we have seen an increase on the uh prepayment mainly on the mortages okay because of the increased rates remember that a lot of a big percentage of our portfolio is some viable rates and floating rates so in that sense that's a dynamic that we have seen and also we have seen due to the increased rates the corporates and the SME's being more cautious in new credit demand okay and the dynamics we can we lived throughout the year continuing that way let's see what happens at the beginning of the year and also if we can see more confidence a little bit and investment okay but now now we see the dynamics in that way please close on the second one morning nacho cost of risk well um um we see cost of risk normalizing in the US as we discussed also in Mexico where we are seeing you know the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business the business mix uh in auto it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to to sell but it should remain stable in the second half of the year so we feel very comfortable that we will beat our 1.2 percent guidance for the end of the year we expect it to be better than the 1.2 percent that we gave us a guidance thank you nacho can we have the next question please next question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead yeah this is the fee from JP Morgan thanks for taking my questions so uh could you just explain that the difference between your reported net interesting gum which was 10.5 billion and the underlying 10.7 billion what explains that the 200 million delta and are there any more one of the net interesting gum that we should be aware of coming in in the short term and then the second question would be on on the capital head wind you mentioned that you expected to remain above 12 percent but could you just outline what capital or core x with the year one head winds you are expecting in the coming quarter or at least on the year end and also if you could remind us what the both of four impacts are thank you okay thank you Francois so Jose will explain you the NII evolution on capital let me reiterate exactly what I said and then Jose can expand a little bit so as I told you we expect to generate at least 10 basis paints of organic capital on average per quarter okay and with that is included with the current remuneration policy that we have okay so as a result what I told you we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12 percent also with the final implementation of base of three comes into effect in 2025 to be precise on that point Jose will comment a little bit more on that and explain you the NII evolution yeah so so fee high morning as I said we don't expect any head winds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could have had capital regulatory or supervisory charges in organic charges or other charges basically market related pensions in tangibles we don't see significant headwinds in the second half of the year in terms of Basel 3 we we we have seen the proposal is still a proposal so we need to wait to see exactly how is how the regulation is approved we still think we will have an impact of between 40 to 60 basis points probably and again depending on how this is finally written probably towards the lower end of that range if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved in terms of the accounting well I think investor relations will give you more details about this is pretty detailed but in the first half there is no impact no adjustments between net interest income statusory and underlying zero what happened in the first quarter is we we had an positive adjustment of 211 million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter which by the way in in in terms of the 20 billion it's a very small amount so no adjustment to NII in the first half where we added to underline in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter there are other adjustments in the PNL but basically netting out in most cases what happened in the first quarter in the second quarter but investor relations will give you all the details land by line of the differences between the first and the second quarter thanks Sophie thank you Sophie can we have the next question please next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from city please go ahead thank you very much my first question is on the digital bank but you please provide an update on your strategy for gathering the positive here you've raised roughly 3.4 billion year today that seems a bit below what you had planned a few months ago you're not supposed to raise your shoes running at 200 percent so how much more deposit do you expect to get and where do you feel like you need to put rates in order to be to be more successful in in northern europe and and germany the second question is follow up on mortgages in the UK you are shrinking pretty fast for billion at per quarter when do you expect to stabilize that book thank you thank you Marta okay on the study of the open bank is quite clear okay and we just don't have open bank as the only vehicle to raise the deposits we have some other vehicles also we have in some of the other different countries okay we believe that the study is right and the one that we're managing to open bank is going along our expectations and we believe that we're going to continue to manage that accordingly okay and in the some other different initiatives that we have for example in germany and some other places the study has been proven very successful and we don't believe we need to basically continue racing rates depending on what the market reacts to it okay so we're going moving it according to the market in terms of mortgages in the UK I was very specific about what we're thinking in terms of profitability okay and the way we're managing the portfolio first of all we've been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk appetite is being very prudent in the way we're managing the UK okay if we see that is there is a change of of how we see the market then we'll adjust at the point but right now we're concentrated in the two things I told you first of all profitability and being cautious on the risk appetite there if we see on of these changes then we'll adjust in any way I don't know if you'd like to comment that you'd be more in the digital consumer bank now includes shopping bank we have 60 billion in the process like you said and I think we obviously manage that to maximize profitability so not only a question of the amount of deposits but the question is managing managing the margins in a business that has negative sensitivity to rates and I think we've been very successful if you compared this figure to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and interracency sensitivity management I think you have to look at the the whole picture and I think we've been very successful in managing interracency sensitivity in a business that is naturally that has naturally negative sensitivity to rates thanks Marta thank you Marta can we have the next question please next question from Andrea Filetri from Media Banka please go ahead yes I can question what is it to get more clear and basically in H2SD one you go into the different geographies and particularly you're given a lot of detail on NII in a lot of countries can you do the same for Brazil please the second question is on Spain if you could split the drivers of NII there between feet of increasing interest rates of the posi beta and the alcoop portfolio contribution thank you okay thank Andrea let me explain a little bit the NII in Brazil and then Jose will give you the details of the drivers of NII and the beta scene Spain okay charging yeah in Spain so to start I mean Brazil NII okay performance here is a quarter is explained first of all on loans since 2021 I have been very specific on that we have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix okay and we have loans volumes electively okay changing the low mix the the low mix to lower risk on the posits okay the fast increasing rates main the rapid rise on the cost of the posits okay we expect NII in the second half of 23 to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with substantial improvement in 24 okay if we see that the rates basically start to come down because it's very important to understand that Brazil has negative sensitivity to the rates we should gain traction and we maintain we're going to maintain a cautious stance but we believe that we can go back to the market okay and we believe that the facial rates could fall in the second half bringing in the cost down in retail funding okay and then in the drivers of NII in Spain and and also we'll give you more details Spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates okay we continue to see strong growth in clients just in the first half of the year we have 300,000 more active clients okay NII in Spain is up around 57 percent in the first half of the year and 60 percent just alone is a second quarter is mostly supported by reprising of the Lomportafolio the higher yield yields and are remained contained on the cost of the posits so we have been managing very well in that sense we expect double digital growth for NII in 2023 and regarding the peak of NII in Spain there are several things to consider that Hoss already explained you assets will continue to reprise at least during the first half of 24 clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas which will be key are we're still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid okay so as of today we don't expect much high remuneration on the foreseeable future so hi Andrea the alcohol in Spain we have 27 billion alcohol 21 billion is a structural long time held to collect with an average maturity of duration of 7.7 years and a yield of 3.3 3.4 percent and then we have 6 billion which is more associated with short-term liquidity management average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below 3 percent and we expect to continue increasing the amount of the alcohol portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak we don't want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates so one way of doing that is not only we are also taking other measures but one way is obviously increasing the alcohol portfolio in terms of betas the beta for the position of Spain is 17.8 percent if we exclude CIV by the way this is 3 percentage points higher than in the first quarter if we exclude CIV the beta is 9.5 percent the beta in CIV is around 60 percent so I think I've given you all the numbers to to figure out exactly you know how we see the betas and the NIA going forward thanks thank you Andrea can we have the next question please next question from Blita Smith from autonomous please go ahead yeah hi there thanks for taking my question could you give a bit more color on the NIA increase the absolute NIA increase in Spain Q and Q the customer spread was up less in the previous quarter but NIA was up a lot more and then secondly could you also update us on the net interest income sensitivity in Brazil over one year and two years and lastly on the 500 million rate benefits that you see more so than previously can you give us an idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current one way thank you okay so let me go backwards here yeah in in the first half the sensitivity was more or less 500 million higher than what we the guidance we gave in at investor day we would expect more or less a similar amount in the second half in euros so we relative to the figures we gave at investor day the interest rate sensitivity in euros due to the fact that obviously rates are higher and we are seeing better betas remember that the betas we use to give that sensitivity at investor day in euros were around 30 percent we are below 20 percent right now and is already half of the year so we would expect another 500 million more in the second half over a billion higher than what we mentioned at investor day and I have sensitivity in Brazil I'm going to give you the rest of the of the currencies as well so if today we had a hundred basis points parallel shift upwards we would make 1.1 1.2 billion more in euros 250 million more in the UK flat slightly negative in the US and a hundred million less in Brazil I think we gave you all the details to understand the NIA sensitivity in Spain but we can take it offline and if you want to you know more detailed analysis but I think we gave you all the details I give you the composition of the balance sheet by by repricing on the asset side so I think that's sufficient I think but but we will take it we will take it offline thank you breter can we have the next question please I think we are much forward taking my questions just a quick follow up from him capital you mentioned the stock financing factor can you please quantify that in terms of stock and and one thing or specific impact on Greece with it assets just to clear that out from all the impacts thank you okay so the stock stock finance is seasonal it tends to go up in December which is the peak in the year then goes it goes down in March go shop a little bit in June and then same in September to pick again in December this year the increase in June was higher than we expected we are talking around six billion in in total risk with the assets from stock finance in in the first half thank you Carlos can we have what I believe is the last question please and if anybody wants to add another question please press star five on your phone thank you next question from Fernando Gildes Antivanias from Bestember please go ahead all right thank you for taking my question two questions please one is important let me expect in terms of mortgage provisions related to free funds come forward you can come with another use of capital and second moments on other your growth I'm looking at UK figures and polar figures and looking at loans loan growth and FIACs in fact it seems like other years are increasing faster than that and you can comment on why it's happening that in those particular changes we're having a lot thank you very much okay sorry Fernando what you said at the beginning was mortgage provisions in Poland yeah okay so Fernando let me tell you exactly how we are in Poland okay up to today okay and with the extra that we did okay we believe that is completely adequate okay we're talking about that in the blended provisions that we have we are provisioned of to 58% okay of the outstanding that we have okay and we believe that's enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there given the dynamics that we have seen in the market and if you basically changing to a slotis when these mortgages started they be about there okay so I believe that to wear at the right point and and we believe the provisions at this level is completely adequate okay on the second I will have Jose no as I explained a long growth year was zero a risk weighted assets increased to percent half of which is FX and I can take you through the composition of risk weighted assets by country but half of the risk weighted asset inflation has to do with FX of the other half we had some positive some negatives as I said we have contraction in the UK we have contraction in terms of risk weighted assets X stock financing auto and slight contraction in Europe and then we had the stock finance expansion in Europe and also risk weighted as a growth in in X effects in Mexico and in Brazil thank you Fernando I'm unclear if there are any further questions we have a question from the line of Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS please go ahead yeah hi good morning sorry it's just a quick follow up on on Brazil if you can give us a little bit more color or at least ballpark magnitude of the substantial growth of NIA you're respecting in in 24 and the sensitivity to rates Jose was mentioning suggests probably around yeah 1% for a hundred basis points decline so just trying to understand basically what kind of magnitude in terms of acceleration of NIA you are expecting next year in Brazil thank you okay thank you Ignacio I will answer the first part of the question and then Jose will help me out with the rest okay this is a sensitivity what I told you is that we believe that the worst is over in Brazil okay and we're starting to see a little bit more growth in the portfolio okay so we're changing that around we're starting to basically go back to the open market which you know in 21 we decided basically to come out of it given the what we saw in the current environment okay so at this point we believe that Brazil is going to be able to turn around and also we see that the rates are going to be helping us out because we believe that already in August should start coming down so in that sense we don't know exactly how the trends are going to work but we see that is this is coming much better than we expect okay and we see that we're going to end up the year basically flat dish to where we do where we started okay so hi Natu we believe interest rates in Brazil will start coming down in August they are at 1375 our central scenario if is for rates to end the year at around 12 12 and a quarter and then probably below 10 by the end of next year so NII when you look at sequentially quarter on quarter NII probably will be flatish in the third but it should increase in the fourth and more so into next year and the exact sensitivity I mentioned the sensitivity to a higher rates but the sensitivity in Brazil to a hundred basis point but this is a parallel shift I insist the parallel shift which is not what will happen probably because we are what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve but flatish in the long end of the curve but through a parallel shift a drop in a hundred basis points will generate 140 million higher revenue in Brazil thank you Natu thank you Natu I believe there are no for the questions so thank you everybody for your attendance and the investor relations team is that your disposal for any other questions that you may have thank you very much\"], ['Good morning everybody and welcome to Van Kursenthenders Conference call to discuss our financial results for the first nine months of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be following today are available to you on our website.', 'Let me just highlight that during the presentation when we refer to global and network businesses we are following the definition which was given during our investor day last February as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in January 24. I am joined here today by your CEO Mr. Rector Grisi and our CFO Mr. José Arteacantera. Following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session.', 'If you would like to ask a question please press star and five on your phone. With this I will hand over to Mr. Grisi, Hector the floor is yours. Thank you, Vigonia. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will focus on today. First I will talk about our nine months results in the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our investor day.', \"José will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with a few closer remarks. As you can see we had another strong quarter demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business model even in times of market volatility as well as a solid execution of our strategy. With the lever record profit of 2.9 billion that's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in 22 that's 26% in constant euros.\", 'Profit for the first nine months of 23 was 8.1 billion up 13% in constant euros driven by strong customer revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year supported by all global businesses and all our unions. Commercial activity remains solid we have the nine million new customers in the last 12 months bringing the total to 166 million.', 'We continue to advance towards a simpler more integrated model through our one transformation which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result our efficiency ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44. Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15% while earnings per share improved by 17% year-on-year supported by profit growth and share buybacks.', 'We further strengthen our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter even after the adopting the share buyback underway and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder valuation and attractive remuneration. Tina plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months and we have increased the cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year. Moving to the income statement as always we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros.', 'Profit increases strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters supported by first of all strong top-light performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as cost increase well below revenue reflecting our transformation efforts. Double digit growth in net operating income to more than 24 billion.', 'Normalization of loan-loss provisions in line with our expectations and as I mentioned in the previous slide this trend resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q223. We will now go into more detail on this once later. These results maintain some track to achieve our 23 targets, targets that we rate the rate. First of all good business dynamics led to double digit revenue growth.', 'Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range even with investments in one transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as suspected and capital ahead of target with C-T1 improving quarter-on-quarter. A rotate is close to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at the end.', \"Looking closer at capital and value creation our C-T1 ratio has grown year to date from 12% to 12.3% backed by a strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continue to grow our shareholders value creation which was up 12% in the first nine months of the year and we're increasing our shareholders remuneration with payout up to 50%.\", 'In September the board of directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results which is being executed as follows. A cash dividend of 8.1 cents per share to be paid in November 39% higher than the equivalent in 22. A share buyback program of up to 1.3 billion that is currently on the way. Since 21 and after completing the current program sometimes that will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares, buybacks through share buybacks.', \"We are progressing in our new phase of value creation and transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. One transformation which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for retail and commercial business across all of our geographies will lead to improved customer service efficiency and profitability. In simplification we have reduced the number of products by 8% in 23. That's almost 800 less products.\", \"In digitalization we're making good progress with our digital sales service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by 16%. We have set up a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just six minutes to complete. Since it's launched in July we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the US we have already captured around 114 million in savings from transformation and simplification.\", \"As you can see on this slide the initial efficiencies from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 117 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 39 basis points in efficiency gains.\", 'For example, multilatinas and multi-Europeans initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model are growing at very high rates with revenue up by 50% in 23 year-on-year. In private banking we continue boosting collaboration with CIVN corporates which has generated over 160 million revenue this year or 30% percent. In Brazil we have acquired 117 new relationships that brought 6 billion reais in net near money.', 'In payments get net already operates in five countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the UK in 24. In Auto we continue to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. In January 23 we have expanded three of our OEM partnerships to new countries. Finally our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a 29 basis points improvement in efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a 125 million saves in this year.', \"55 from the recent deployment of gravity, 60 from the new global agreements with vendors and 9 million from the implementation of new IT and OBS shared services. Let's look at how one transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue proactive customer. Process automation is enabling us to spend less time in operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel.\", \"Since our investor day we have reduced the number of operational FTs per million customers by 5%. We are already deploying global platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale and spread best practices. We have implemented across the group proprietary backhand gravity already deployed in three countries and CIB. This is delivering 55 million inefficiencies in 23 and we have executed 75 billion transactions this year alone, that's 10% of the group's total.\", \"We're expanding our cards platform across a group, delivering real-time digital processing capability store banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around 100 million per year when it's fully deployed. Finally, we are being able to transfer the best in-class products and processes from the country of Oregon to the rest of the group, which lets to a strong value creation. The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear.\", 'In CIB we continue to grow strongly. Our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop-shop service to all our clients, capturing crozor their flows and making CIB products and services available to our wealth, retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa. As a result, revenue from these two concepts or negative revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to 3 billion.', \"Wealth management and insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well-abop target, boosted by benefits of the Santander network effect. In private banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have 52 billion of assets on their management book tabo. That's 12% higher than a year ago. Our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market.\", 'Our payments have has become one of the largest processors of account-to-account payments in Europe. Spain, the UK and CIB are already processing a significant payment volume through Pagonext, while we execute full migration of all the groups 8 to 8 payments in the next 18 months. In Alto, we continue to prioritize profitability of our market share growth in a context of rising interest rates. Global auto revenue was affected by lower-list income in the US and the new regulation in Germany.', 'One transformation is now being extended across a group and the increasing contribution from a global and a group of businesses are helping us to reach our 25 profitability targets across regions and businesses. Some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates and they should continue to do so in 24. As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of improvement.', \"This is a clear competitive advantage that will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation. The group's Rote rose 126 basis points year-on-year to run 15% as mentioned before. Jose will go now in more detail to the group's performance. Thank you Jose. Thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail.\", 'Starting with revenue, there was strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. This was primarily supported by a retail business as we actively managed interest rate tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America. We delivered double digit growth across most businesses, in particular our network businesses which made up 38% of total revenue.', 'The only exception was auto which was affected by lower listening income in the US. Revenue at the corporate center also improved by more than 500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII which continued its upward trend, increasing 7% in the quarter driven mostly by Europe and Mexico. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters.', 'Nine months 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in DCV North America and South America. In terms of profitability we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion.', \"In Europe we are strictly managing the positive costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, whether it's excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment but beat us remaining in line with our expectations. In South America the positive rates are more directly linked to market interest rates with results in negative sensitivity to raising rates. Therefore as interest rates are starting to decline we are seeing improved NII trends.\", 'In North America in the US beat us continue to increase, although in line with our expectations while net interest margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward in Europe we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in a constant in a context of stable interest rates or a slight increase which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of the positive growth at least in the first half of next year. At the same time as I said we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in South America.', 'Turning to fees in an environment of low-fink and growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity our netfink and grew 9% compared to the third quarter of 22 and 6% year on year with good performance across regions and businesses. Retail banking grew well supported by a larger customer base and our tailored and targeted value propositions.', 'Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees with corporate investment banking and Paganxed leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate investment banking is increasing its share of leading roles and Paganxed continued to expand its businesses increasing total payment volumes 24% year on year and transactions 32%. Wealth management and insurance was slightly up as customers moved to lower value added funds than bringing lower fees.', \"However we saw increase activity in both private banking and Santanderas' management with three consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year on year driven by good performance in all our main markets. In terms of cost savings from one transformation initiatives which will become more evident in the coming quarters are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization.\", 'Group cost declined 0.5% real-terms and driving down the transaction cost per active the transactional cost per active customer 2% in real-terms as sector mentioned earlier. This in turn is reflected in efficiency gains laid by Europe which improved six percentage points with cost flat in real-terms. In North America and DCB cost increases likely in real-terms reflecting investments to accelerate transformation.', 'Additionally cost was also slightly affected by some perimeter effects such as the incorporation of APS in the US and MCE bank acquisition and US delantes agreement in DCB. As a result group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expected to stay for the rest of the year. Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in use car prices in the US.', 'The MPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than 1.2%. Spain continues to perform well with a 12-man cost of risk down nine basis points year-on-year supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions.', 'In other units such as the UK Portugal and the digital consumer bank the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expected to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Mexico is also increasing although it remains at comfortable levels mainly due to a change in mix towards and secure loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability. Normalization continues in the US in line with expectations.', 'As we mentioned last quarter cost of risk in Brazil seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-man cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row and the MPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high rated customers. To close with our balance structure we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment product and country. Our balance sheet is low risk.', 'The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low loan to values, average loan to values. Loans decrease 2% year-on-year as a consequence of higher interest rates reducing credit demand and driving early repayments, especially evident in Europe and especially evident within European mortgages. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and the C.B.', 'On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well at 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as the positive inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments. Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which has stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.', 'Mutual funds rose 11% with growth across all countries except the US following a year of instability in 2022. Our fully-doted capital ratio improved to 12.3%, but by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in a quarter, which included 33 basis points charged in shareholder remuneration. 21 related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual.', 'We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a frontbook return on res-weighted assets of 2.7% up from 2.5% in the first nine months of 2022 equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward.', 'Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of res-weighted assets with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our investor day target of 85 in 2025. Increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years. We are confident our fully-loaded capital ratio will remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel 3 in 2025 on a fully-loaded basis.', \"That's all from my side, Ektor, over to you. Thank you. Thank you Jose. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with customer and double digit revenue growth supported by all region regions and businesses. We are accelerating one transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth.\", 'We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CETI-1, while credit quality remains strong in line with our expectations. All of these contributes to double digit growth in shareholder value creation and increased remuneration. We remain on track to meet our 23 targets. The execution for strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability.', 'We see further upside potential for NII growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rates hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South America. Efficiency, or ready at the lower range of our 23 target, is expected to keep improving or revenue cost as we increasingly realize one transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target and we expect it to remain at similar levels in 24.', 'At our investor day, we set a rotted target of 15 to 17%. We expect to reach a rote above 15% by the year end and continue to improve significantly during 24. And we see our fully loaded CET-1 clearly above a 12% target even after the implementation of ASL-3 in January 25.', \"As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double digit shareholder value creation through the cycle further supported by our last step towards the full implementation of one standard which will enable us to fully capture our in market and global value. And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions. Thank you, Hector. We're ready to start the Q&A session. Can we have the first question please? If you wish to ask the question, please press star 500 telephone.\", \"We already have the first question from Francisco Rical from Alan Trague. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I want to focus on long growth. In Spain has been particularly weak, it's down 10% year and year, the sector is minus 3. I see that most of the fall is related to CIV, which is down over 20%, but SME and Morgan Villes are also weak if you can comment the gap with the sector. We know demand is weak, but below the sector.\", 'More broader in other regions, I mean, longs in the UK are also down 5%, the sector is up 1, Brazil is up by just 3%. The sector is growing 9%, so you can elaborate on whether you are feiorityizing margins over volumes. If you are more prudent on risk taking up this point in the cycle, so long growth in general and in Spain in particular. Thank you. Thank you Francisco. Yes, basically, as you have said, long growth has not been good in the old year, I would say.', 'Spain mainly, as you basically say, is also being affected by prepayments in some of the mortgages. If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen, I mean, normally, basically, we go down 3.5, this basically we have had prepayments up to 6.5 billion so far this year. You write SME and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much.', 'I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and the man continues to be strong, this is a fact and we have seen the clients basically being cautious. Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America, is continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability.', \"So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way. And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year and we continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear bill of what's going on. I believe that credit will come back.\", \"Little by little. I don't know if you would like just one. One final comment. Resuaded assets are down to billion in the quarter, but it's exclusively due to effects. So if we look, if we exclude effects impact on resuaded assets, resuaded assets are actually flat in the quarter, which is what, you know, matter most for profitability and capital. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone.\", \"I'm Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the profitability outlook and the second one on us acquiring the US. So starting with the first one, you've right away to your guidance for the Fulia, which, if a mom is taken implies, an app profit around 10.9 billion euros for this year. Can you confirm that? And how do you see profitability in 2024?\", \"It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the US. My second question is respect to our equality in the US. There was a big uptick this quarter and you've been talking about normalization and cost of risk. And I will see lower use car prices and higher the link, but neither of them were material changes. So a question is what's driving this?\", \"Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing specifically on us, equality, and related to that. I see you've confirmed your 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do you expect this number to look like next year? Thank you. Yes, thank you, Antonio. Okay, on profitability, as I say during the presentation, I rate the rate, the 15% rotting, so that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for. Okay, so in that sense, we'll pretty comfortable on that.\", \"On 24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing, so we see an strong first half of the year in Europe, and then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamic changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better. Okay, so in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that.\", \"In terms of asset quality in the US, and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look of what happened last year in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that and we told you so. And what is important to tell you that is actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points as you correctly appoint.\", \"In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day the link-wancies or above when it's used to happen is we use to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better and we are repossessing between 60 and 65% of those. If the trade continues like that and a use car prices in the US continue like that, we expect better performance that we normally expect.\", \"It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio. But that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain a good levels. And also the US has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamics as well.\", \"So in that sense I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you. Jose, please would like to compliment on the profitability? Yeah, just one final comment on US As a Quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85 and given the changes in the mix that Ektor mentioned, we don't expect to reach those levels at all and we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly apt compared to 2023 in the US.\", 'In terms of profitability, we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So rates start going down. We will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil in particular, coupled with higher long growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly the profitability in South America sector mentioned is going to gain momentum throughout the year, which with a much better second half relative to the first half.', \"And in Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprise on the asset side. There's one example. In Spain we have around 80 billion of mortgages. You know that they reprise around 12 every month. Well, in fact, we reprise 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of 24, we will still reprise a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to reprising.\", 'So asset reprising, particularly in Spain, and obviously some beta pressures and the cost of deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we actually, you know, we remain constructive on profitability and profitability improving actually in 24 relative to 23. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Sophie Peterson for JP Morgan, please go ahead. Yeah, hi. Here is the feedback from JP Morgan.', 'Just to develop on the previous question. So could you just remind us what the current deposit beta in Spain is? And I got a part with Moved in the quarter and also how you see the deposit beta moving in the other geographies, mainly UK, US, and I guess also Portugal. So that would be my first question. And then the second question would be around the US tax rate. It was very low this quarter. How should we think about the US tax rate going forward and what kind of normalised run rate?', \"And then if I may, just if you get comments on any capital headlines going forward, thank you. Thank you Sophie. And if you're on to use, plainly, I'll be the second question because we couldn't hear you well. First of all, on deposit bitters, I mean bitters today's in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had. And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally. And we expect pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase.\", \"I mean, it's normal because of the dynamics of what's going on. And the geographies we are present are showing a different behaviour. Our CO4 now give you a little bit further details on that. Yeah, Sophie, in Spain, total beta is slightly over 20%, 22%. But if we exclude corporate investment banking, corporate investment banking is already almost fully priced. X corporate investment banking is 13%. Remember that we have 153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes.\", \"So and the beta there is almost zero. We don't expect any significant change in the behaviour in the market in the coming quarter. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year. In the UK, beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that, it's around 50%. So here we would expect higher, gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher.\", 'The new mortgage pricing in the UK today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland 30%, and in the US is 32%. XCV, X corporate investment banking is 31%. Very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that.', 'So bottom line is we would expect cost of the process to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly in Spain, also in the UK, etc. So in terms of the tax rate in the US going forward, what I could tell you and we could basically contact you to give you more detail, I believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles and that basically helps us in the tax rate that we have outstanding today.', \"But to give you details, we later could call you and give you exactly what's going on there. Your final question, capital head. The only one is the only significant capital head we have is the final implementation of Basel III. Still some detail rulings or regulations need to be written, but bottom line is the total fully loaded impact would be around 50 or 55 basis points. The facing impact, so the charge on January 1st, 25, is going to be between 15 to 20 basis points.\", \"So again, very much in line with previous expectations, maybe it's better than what we expected. Thank you, Sophie. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Ignacio Larghi from BNP Pariva, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I just have a thanks for taking my question time for the presentation. I have just two questions.\", 'The first one on Brazil, after the performance that we have seen this quarter, where that has been growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we suspect better, moment in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk appetite? So we see an acceleration of growth also due to mixed changes as we are seeing in Mexico. And what should be a spec for 2024 from Brazil?', \"And also, if you could say a bit of color on what has been the driver of course growth in Spain in the quarter and whether we suspect some synergies coming from one to another in coming quarters in Spain or or it's more restricted to Mexico and the US. Thank you. Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been seeing is as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix. Okay?\", \"So you're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out. First of all, because our some of them, the positions that we took actually the credit loans that we gave, basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out. Because remember that the mix that we changed went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans and the mix has also changed and is getting better. We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs.\", \"So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean, we're open to a little bit more of giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well. But our credit appetite is cautious nevertheless. And we expect Brazil, basically, to perform really well in that sense. Okay?\", \"So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we manage in the portfolio. And second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe is going to be much better. In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we are being implementing one transformation. Okay?\", \"So with implementation of one transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit some processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the banking that sense. But as you're going to see, a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact, because we are, as you know, we are simplification, we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have. We are doing also automation of many different things.\", \"And we are pushing our branches, basically, to move more toward businesses than look at the incidence of problems. So all that transformation that we're making in the, in all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more. But it's going to be in control. And we expect that to continue drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that. Okay?\", \"So in terms of, in Brazil going back to just to that, just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of 24. Okay? As we continue to go on and we'll be lob the portfolio is going to be performing much better. Okay? I don't know Jose, if you would like to complement? As I said, I think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum. So we have already started to see a slight change. Rates have dropped just a hundred basis points to from 1375 to 1275.\", 'We expect another 100 basis point drop in the third quarter. Sorry, in the fourth quarter. But we would expect probably 200 to 250 drop next year. So this accumulates. So when we look at year-on-year, third quarter, fourth quarter, we would see rates probably 400 basis points down. So clearly the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?', \"Next question from Alvaro Serrano for Moro Young Stanley. Please go ahead. Next question and we'll recapture Alvaro later on. Thank you. Thank you. The next question from San Pedro from CD. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on restructuring charges. So understand your profitability target is underlying. Should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your new reporting structure?\", \"The second question is your outlook on operating expenses in the US. You've gone on a hiring of investment bankers recently. So what is the outlook for cost and how much revenue do you expect to generate as a result? And just quickly on your effective tax rating, Brazil for 2024, and what is your expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital? Thank you. Thank you, Marta.\", \"No, we don't expect any restructuring charges at all or because of the restructuring that we just did in the organization. The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. Okay, this is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what one transformation means, which means exactly simplifying first of all, okay, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly, okay.\", \"Second, basically, automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, okay, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a good, really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client. In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain, it's 50% of that.\", \"So basically, this is what one transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, MhR acquiring that has been deployed already, mostly Latin America, you see the cost coming down, and you see also that we're getting revenue on quota from our customers.\", \"So in that sense, it's very important that you understand where one transformation is, and why are we doing this? Second, in terms of, you said one question, what's on operating expenses in the US? Very important question. What we're doing in the US is just a complement of the rest of our CIV business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIV, I mean large for the standards of Latin America, and a very important player also in CIV in Europe.\", \"It's important to point out that 94% of our business that we do there is client oriented. It's very important to understand that. It's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, it's selling effects, it's selling plain vanilla derivatives, it's doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients, Admitzize and SME clients. This is basically the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the US. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIV in the US.\", \"This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in four or five particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe in the US, which by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing. This is a size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator.\", \"You're going to see that revenue is going to start to pick up in CIV pretty fast given that because it's already a complement as I was saying of the rest of the business. Tax rate in Brazil next year, Eurasian, sorry, taxes on on capital, that's been proposed and discussed is not approved and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed.\", 'The finance minister believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that because the main reason for that is to tax companies that are not paying taxes. The banks are paying already lots of taxes. So I think we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take, but by no means is a done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented. Thank you, Marta. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Hi, good morning.', 'Thank you very much for the presentation. From a side, a quick question on revenue performance, we will explain how NIR has been the key driver of revenue momentum. However, going back to the capital market day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be on the performing a little bit or initial expectation. Could you elaborate on that?', 'Is that the market momentum as weekend, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that you are running behind your initial plan? And second, when you talk about the cost of resuscitationality in the US, could you explain a little bit better why is that? And why there is such a concentration in traditions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand.', \"And lastly, on reporting changes, I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the regional commercial and new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional PNL and balance sheets for each subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail? Thank you very much. Thank you Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market.\", \"No, if you see the fees, for example, in the first nine months, we grew 6% year-on-year, okay? It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, no? Mainly CIV and payments, okay? It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income, okay? And by 25, that would increase from 42 to 50%. So basically, according to our plan, okay?\", \"It's important also that risk-capitite increase is changing the portfolio mix, okay? And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out, okay? And we see also, and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue exactly what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIV that is basically up 15% year-on-year. Pagonex is a payment side and merchant acquiring is up to 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, you know?\", \"Because exactly what's happening in the market? The auto business is generating 5% more across the board, okay? You see very good performance in Mexico and the US and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have, okay?\", \"So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to start into come up also helping out by what's the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly, okay? So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well and also as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the field revenue. That's basically what has been one of the laggers, the field revenue, okay? The seasonality in the US is has always been like that.\", \"I mean, that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marketing the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, etc.\", \"The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the US and also that people basically don't want to refine other cars or don't see the availability of loans and cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out and that's why you see better numbers and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points.\", \"And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today and was expected to continue, okay? And also the change of mix is getting us out, okay? So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind. In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment, okay?\", \"So you will continue to have that information. I don't know, Jose, if I left anything out?\", \"No, no, no, I think we will report as we manage the bank, so we will report these horizontal businesses as the primary segments obviously, but we will continue sector-set providing all the information from a country level upwards, so you will be able to see the country's performance organized by these businesses and the global performance organized by countries, so you will be able to have both views at the same time. Thank you Carlos. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?\", \"Next question from Alba Rosarano from Morgan Stanley. Hi, sorry for earlier. A couple of questions, one is really a follow-up and thanks very much for your steer on provisions for 2024. If I can sort of take advantage of, you open that door, in the context of what we've seen in the US, within flat provision, what direction or a bit of color, how could we expect the US evolve in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 6065.\", \"It was 58, I think you put the number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings, and now you have student loans picking up. Is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024, or do you think it could take more time to just understand how you're thinking about the US within that flat group context?\", \"And the second, hopefully easier one, is on the UK, you've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the UK as a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there specifically for UK, given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough comedy, on deposits you had your own offering out in September, so maybe you got more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Alberto.\", \"Actually, I was expecting your question on the US, so let me give you exactly what is the important, different dynamic that car has to student loans and different things. The car in the US is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe as in Latin America, actually people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage, and then the auto loan, etc. In the US is the other way around. The US, if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around.\", \"I mean, you're completely isolated. So the behavior of the auto loans in the US is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. That's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. That's exactly why the behavior of the link when it's basically coming from in that way.\", \"Normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60 to 62, 63 percent maybe going up. Let's see how the US evolves and if we have a soft landing or not that will only depend on that. Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio as we have set already. That's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in-prime and in-ear-prime.\", \"Even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk and the way. But we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio and also we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, etc. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that and very cautious on the way we manage in cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly.\", \"And then on the UK, the UK, as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of one transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there leading to probably and the UK is leading probably to its best year in bottom line.\", \"But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming it and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the UK with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities. NIAI has grown year on year 9.3. I was driven by higher rates as you know and we have a really strong focus on managing spreads and profitability.\", \"So you see that we have been lowering the portfolio that because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean we are as the rest of the market at 2.2. But we are offsetting the increased cost of retail funding and slowdown of new year regulations by basically playing in that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities. It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability of head of market share. Okay.\", 'And we have lower risk appetite as I told you. And we believe that we could have an immense pension by doing that. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Andrea Filtre from MedioBanca. Please go ahead. Yes. Good morning. First question on if you can remind us of the Brazilian interest rate sensitivity. Second question is follow up on several questions from colleagues.', \"If you can actually give us a concrete indication of the structural tax rate in Brazil and in the US in light of the new electric vehicles leading that you're doing. Is this a structural move or is just a one-off that we've seen? Then on capital, given that you are confirming your 15 to 17% target with a 15% for this year, should we not see also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate? And finally, digital euro.\", 'What do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation have you budgeted the impact to your business model and can you share it with us? Thank you. Thank you Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro and then Jose will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital.', \"First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and is a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated that discussions should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June 24. And they're saying that instead they were examining and in a quiet and slow way by the new Commission and the new Parliament.\", 'So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense. In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized the investigation phase of the digital euro, as they said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a two-year preparation phase as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it.', \"It will evolve finalizing in the rulebook and the selection selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important and this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen. And as a decision on the digital euro, I don't believe we'll not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't spec to release before 2016.\", 'On this context, I mean, us as Van Gogh Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the digital euro. Also developed the Pan-European integrated payments market is basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions.', \"And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe and also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and the implementation phase. Okay. So that's a way we see it at this point. With this, I will basically pass it to José to tell you. Hello Andrea.\", \"Brazil's interest rate sensitivity is 150 million euros to a drop of 100 basis points or things been equal. Tax rate, in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the US. And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation.\", \"We don't expect any significant regulatory charges or the other than the ones we mentioned and obviously always subject to available for sale, impacts, etc. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital build up. So you're right. I mean, the higher the higher the profitability, the better. We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk weighted assets across the group.\", 'In the first nine months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around 15 to 18 billion in risk weighted assets. We think we can do more or less 30 billion or close to 30 billion, 25 to 30 this year. And that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet. So on our balance sheet.', \"So the focus going forward is going to be the optimizing risk weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So you're right that we would expect the capital build up to accelerate in the coming quarters. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Pablo de la Torre quebas, from RBC. Please go ahead. Hi and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on credit cards in Brazil.\", 'Could you please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country? And if possible, could you please give us any indication of the contribution to Brazilian NII of these types of lending? And any estimate that you can give us on the potential penalty impact of the new measures announced?', 'I guess besides the negative impact to NII, are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality? And are there any offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pablo. Hoso will tell you basically about the situation in Brazil. Again, these are ongoing negotiations. I just already referred to Interstone Capital. Here again, the focus is more on corporates than financials.', \"Obviously, there might be an effect on banks, but that's not the main focus. But in our case, it would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as it has been proposed. But again, we think that will change credit cards. The 90-day period for self-regulation is already counting and is finalizing by year end. We do not expect an agreement here. So probably by sending the Bankers Association in Brazil, sorry, the central bank in Brazil will have to regulate.\", \"There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a modeling which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principle, which is called the UK model. Again, Sandandair and Febra Banda, the Bankers Association, are already working with the central bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on Nenai, but there might be ways of offsetting this through commission income, etc.\", 'Because there is a lot of significant rotation of the balances in Brazil. So again, working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank, BPI, please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good morning, Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank. A couple of questions from my side as well in a few minutes.', 'So on NNII, a minor detail, but in my majority, but in Portugal you have a 40% quarter and quarter in Greece. In NNII, this quarter, I see the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the previous quarter. You do have an increase in the alcohol portfolio, but in any case, I was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution and also what should we expect in coming quarters.', \"Then on the UK and NNII as well, I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect, I feel at previously, or you were wondering about a high single digit increase in NNI in the UK for this year, you expect that to be the case still and how do you see it evolving into next year. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you Carlos. NNII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal, no. It's been helping us out basically because of the reprising of the portfolio, the rates we're going.\", \"I believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe, so that will help out and then we'll stabilize. That's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time and we don't see more growth in that sense. NNII should stabilize in Portugal. In terms of the UK, I explained quite well exactly what's going on. If I made before you go. Just to give some more color on Portugal.\", \"When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3 in the first quarter, 4 in the second, 4.6 in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14, 26, 38, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days. All of this may explain the differences.\", \"But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent. I would expect, as Ektor said, obviously, there is a limit to the reprising of assets. Mortgage is in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the six-month Uriber, not the 12-month Uriber in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of the post-us in Portugal is really, really low and we don't see any competition there.\", 'So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. Thank you, Jose. Very quickly on the UK carlos. As I said, basically, we continue to put profitability ahead of market share. We have lower risk appetite given the dynamics on that market. And we combined that and we would like to combine that with the wood performance with that basically could lead to an immense pension.', \"But answering your question, I expect in 2023 with a high single digit growth and on high rates management of the deposit cost, well, we assume the lower volumes that we have. And that's basically the outlook that we have for the UK at this point. I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to compliment what I think with that, I answer your question. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Blita Smith from autonomous. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi there.\", \"Thank you for taking my questions. The first one will be on the NRI in Spain. The customer spread widened and you've also increased the alcohol portfolio, but the NIMO is flat. So maybe you can explain what's happened there and also give us an update on the alcohol portfolio. And the second one will be on Chile. We've seen a big decline in NRI here. I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year.\", 'But what do you think is the outlook there for this year and also when will the NRI improve in 2024? Thanks. Thank you, Blita. I will start basically, give you the overall view and then Jose can give you a little bit more of details on both. I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most from the higher rates. And we continue to see, as I said, a strong growth from clients. We have a 651,000 new customers, net new customers in the last 12 months.', \"We see also a strong contribution from the global businesses. Wealth management is increasing 84% year-in-year. CIV 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And CIV is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that. We expect double digit NRI growth in 23. Okay. And in terms, we see very factors to consider. We see as Jose explained you in detail assets reprising at least during the first half of 24. Okay.\", \"Clients continue to grow and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no minimum, no meaningful deposit moments in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. The deposit basis is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of 20,000 euros, which basically contributes to the stability. Also, it's very important to take into account that the one transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well.\", \"And we're very focused on the product simplification, as I said, where we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. Okay. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to have. Exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. Yeah. Rita, let me tell you, Elon loans. This is the same explanation that we have of Portugal.\", 'In quarter and quarter, it basically has to do with many, many, probably many small things. But when you look at Elon, Elon loans in Spain, from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5, first quarter, 3.3, second quarter, 3.8, fourth quarter, 4.3. So very much, almost an Australian line increase. And in the case of the deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53, 72, 19, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat.', 'So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprise up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages is 77 billion and around 60% reprise is in the first half. So I think the Elon loans will continue although the rates interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe might stay flat. The reprise in of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year.', 'And in terms of the pressure on the cost of the deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already reprised. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. So to what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits. And we think that is a limited amount.', \"So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of the deposits. In Chile, we have two balance sheets. So two sensitivities to the balance sheet one is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal.\", 'So we see an IIM Brazil actually expanding, again, gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantial in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year. Because again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the UF and rates. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Hugo Cruz from KBW, please go ahead. I think for the time you go from KBW, just a couple of questions.', \"Mexico and I, the growth of Q&A will be quite strong. I guess I'm not going to ask you why it's been stronger than expected by one. If you could give guidance for the full year, what kind of an agro to you expecting years? And then finally on Argentina, quite volatile, and we have elections soon. So I was wondering if you can give what to expect or impact from the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. Thank you. Thank you.\", \"Mexico, as you have seen, has been a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and on secure loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before.\", \"So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio. So it's quite important to see that. We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months. And I believe it's going to grow strongly also on 24. The important thing to understand is actually how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the US.\", \"Both I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on 24 and continue to have very good growth on NIA. Okay, in terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really, and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks at may things stay as they are.\", \"We have, as you know, a potential difference between the, in the exchange rate, between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the, in the black market. So in that sense, let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult tasks they have in front. Now, the just one final comment here, the way we've managed Argentina is to have, we're trying to hedge, obviously, against inflation, and hedging our investment against inflation.\", 'And that will continue to be the key element. Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and unofficial exchange rates. We are aware of that. We are aware of the impact that a devaluation could have on our books. So we are managing that to minimize the impact if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our investment in Brazil, but basically by managing and investing inflation risk. Thank you very much.', \"Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Fernando Gil de Santibanes from West Inverte, please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Thank you, please. First of all, I'm Peter Puchino-Bank. I see the current possible focus 11% still have reached off from the target, but 15%. Then you have for the ban, can you please comment the outlook for 2024? Please, this is the first one. The second would be about the alcohol portfolio.\", 'I see an increase in about 10 billion in the quoted. Can you please request strategy? Can the level of unrealized loss of e-calflux portfolio and highly unfolded? If you can please comment on the outlook for the extension on the mortgage holidays, please. Thank you very much. So let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We are going to have a new government and this will have to go to parliament.', 'So very early stages of this proposal and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal if any will be conducted because again this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government. The Alcozory also briefed us about this and I forgot. We have more or less 27, almost 30 billion of alcohol in Spain at an average yield of around 3. 4%. We expect to end the year at around 30 billion.', 'We might increase the alcohol a little bit more next year, obviously taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of the process or against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability but obviously this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year. Yes, on this C.B. There has been a particular change in the business in this year. In this C.B.', 'in particular, there is one very important. We had a really good growth in terms of loans but the majority of those loans at the vast majority is basically stock financing. Okay, giving the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months. First of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now the basically we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships.', \"We expect basically to start that the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. Okay, so that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve.\", \"It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale and also you're going to see a dynamic or what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans directly to individuals. Okay, so we believe that the outlook would be good.\", \"It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. One final comment here, although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously the higher the rates the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability.\", 'The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because of the way we do not have sensitivity to that movement. Obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that one point I wanted to make. The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitization, etc.', \"So a range is to try to minimize that like Ektor was saying by managing the assets that we have on our books. Thank you. Can we have the last question please? Last question from Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I've got the F3 followers. The first one is on the NIA in Brazil. I mean, I used to stick into the guidance you gave in Q2, that Q4 would be better than Q3.\", \"And if you can give a little bit of color in terms of the pattern of NIA expansion next year, QB is expecting like a linear increase through the year. You're going to have some degree of seasonality at some point. The second one is on the US. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but one has driven the 13 percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the unit.\", \"And the third one is on capital return, giving you comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of a positive or do you see any chances of stopping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in 24. Thank you. Thank you. Look Ignacio, in terms of NIA in Brazil, I think it's important. I mean, we rate the rate first of all, as I have seen the worst of the NIA is behind us.\", \"We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NIA in the coming quarters. Okay. Rates as Hoss explained to you have started to curve down. I mean, 100 basis points in the Q323. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 1175. So that's basically tells you, we're flattening the Q2. The clinging rates proscrate activity increasing plus market related NIA no longer a drag. NIA improvements.\", \"So that basically tells you that we, yes, we believe that the second, sorry, that the four quarters is going to be better than the third. Okay. In terms of what do we see in the future, it's exactly as Hoss explained you is that we see a trend going upwards towards more towards the second half of the year next year. Okay.\", \"And that's the way we see it is going to help out if rates continue to come down and Bolleux continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point. All right. In terms of the US coverage, okay. It's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed, okay. And we have an update in long to values include the current value of the cars, okay.\", \"And in addition of the quarters, we have CRE charges due to the angry rating of several companies in the sector and in FinTech charges due to origination in that sense, but I see that this would normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said, okay. So in that sense, I don't see a problem that is also there was an increasing provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with a GST remediation, but other than that, I think it's quite what it was quite normal.\", \"Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77, okay. And it's below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is about the total all portfolio is flat year and year, 2.7. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital we turn, please Jose. No, I think that's for the board to decide. So for this year, the policy has been decided and that's for the board to decide, obviously. Thank you. I believe we have no questions.\", 'So thank you very much, everybody, for your time. As always, the Investor Relations team remains at your disposal for any and all questions that you may have. Thank you. Bye-bye.'], [\"Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's conference called to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our executive chair, Ms. Ana Botín, our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi and our CFO, Mr. José García Candera.\", \"Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. With this I will hand over to Ms. Botín. Another floor is yours. So thank you very much, Oña. Good morning to everybody. It's a great pleasure to be with all of you. Thank you for joining. As a reminder, we have recently announced a last step towards one Santander. We finished the creation of the five global businesses which we began a few years ago.\", 'I will come back to this in more detail in a moment, but I would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that were communicated last December. So the focus today will be first main highlights of our results and update on our strategy. Hector will then review of our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with a few closing remarks and now titled for 24.', \"So the high-level messages we are presenting record results 11.1 billion euros. We have delivered again on all our financial targets. Our customer focus and scale the driving consistent sustainable profitable growth. In 23, we added 5 million customers and our revenue increased double digit. And we did this as we continue and something we've reiterated here after year. We are investing for the future and we are also making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model.\", \"This is the driver to the improvement in efficiency year after year, 173 basis points. And it's also the driver to increase our profitability this year to about 15% as we committed. We have also in 23 strengthened our balance growing deposits, sound asset quality, again below our guidance and increasing our growth organic capital generation. So in a summary, backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks, our earnings per share grew 21% our Tina Van Cash DPS by 15.\", \"And once approved by shareholders, we expect our different per share to be near 50% higher than last year. So just briefly to the income statement, again, you can see the successful execution of our strategy in a strong top line performance. And what's really important is that across all our global businesses, this is the case. And that interest in come rows 12%, 16% in constant euros.\", 'In a context of higher rates and with a special good performance in our retail and commercial banking business in Europe and Mexico, net fee income was also higher. In this case, the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions or global businesses, the corporate banking payments driving higher fees. Very important, the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle.', \"I want a special focus on the high quality of our revenue, where net interest income and fees are more than 95% of total income and drove the vast majority of Santa and theirs total revenue growth. We're growing costs less than revenues of positive operating leverage, including investment in our transformation, where we already seeing results.\", \"We achieved record net operating income of 32 billion, that's the second highest among our global peers, again, showing our continuing focus on operational performance. And finally, the strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk, where we finished at 118 again better than our guidance. And therefore delivering on all the targets, as I just mentioned.\", \"So what this means in terms of capital generation, and the double digit, the check hold of value creation that resulted from the results. We're ending the year at the same level as September with a city 1 ratio at 12.3. And that is after a crewing 20 basis points for the buyback, which means that actually would have been at 50 basis points on a like for like compared to last year. We delivered 15% growth in check hold of value creation.\", \"Again, this represents an increase of more than 10 billion in the year. And already mentioned 50% increase in cash dps against 23 results, once we get a shareholder's approval in March. The reduction in the number of shares throughout share buybacks also of course helped and a higher payout, which we increased from 40 to 50 this year. We continue to believe that at these prices share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate a shareholder value.\", \"Since 21, we have repurchased 9% of outstanding shares. And buybacks currently deliver and return on investment of close to 18% for our shareholders. So let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets. Step by step, we're making a business model stronger. We continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year after year, global utility, high predictability, while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration.\", 'The record results in 23 means a 10% kegar in profit since 2013, increasing profitability to 15.1 from below 10. Again, improvements each and every year with the exception of COVID. And at the same time, we have steadily grown our capital. Please remember that when I took over, we had a CT1 ratio of 8.3, so we have a lot more capital and delivering much better results.', \"I also want to point you to a couple of numbers, which is over the past nine years we've generated approximately 26 billion of capital, which we've used to build up the CT1 to 12.3. And that is on top of the 27 billion paid to shareholders over this time period. Very importantly, today's shareholder remuneration is five times that of 2014 and has grown again every year except for the COVID crisis where dividends were halted in light of the ECB's recommendations.\", \"As we think about value creation, this is our framework. We presented this one year ago in our new medium-term plan. This is a new face of value creation where we are having a very strong foreseer as you've seen in today's results. We're on track to achieve all the targets and very importantly, compounding our equity through increased profits, which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road.\", \"I would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with retail and consumer DCB, which of course is the majority of Santander. And this is the reason we're confident we will continue to deliver medium-term targets and beyond the customer-focused diversification, huge strength, at times like this.\", 'And because we are doubling down on a very unique Santander strength, which very few can replicate, which is our local leadership and our global scale and network. We are the only bank in the world that has such a global and in-market scale at the same time. 165 million customers globally with a market share over 10% in most of our co-markets and operating at scale in every one of them.', \"The strength and potential of Santander's scale and network, again, are already evident in the numbers for this year. We can serve more customers, captured new revenue streams that some of our competitors cannot. And it is precisely this network effect, which is helping us to grow across border flows. And you see this already in the very substantial growth in global businesses like the corporate bank. And we are increasingly seeing that also in payments and others.\", \"But very important this scale allows us to invest together once across the group to operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience. So it's a win-win combination, both on revenues and efficiency. And you're going to see much more of this in the years ahead. Because this combines a very strong starting point with a strong franchise and in parallel the deployment of our global platforms which include proprietary technology. Again, this is incredibly differential for Santander.\", \"This has been most of our peers. And we are ultimately aiming to be the most profitable retail and commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate. We're already top three in terms of profitability in eight over 10 markets, but we have a lot more upside. I'm not going to go over this slide, but it's really a summary just to remind us where we are. It's a last step. We took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions.\", \"But now in the retail bank and in the consumer bank slash DCB, we have taken a very important strategic step. We're operating in this way already during 2023. We're pulling investments. We're reducing cost in a structural way. And I want to emphasize in a structural way, we are already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently. And again, improving customer experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth. So just briefly the five divisions.\", 'The retail commercial bank, which I will refer to as retail, our vision we said a year ago is becoming a digital bank with branches. This means three very important steps for simplifying a product offering and making it digitally available with a branch network and our people serving as very powerful sales and value added advisory channel. In 2023, we reduced products by 16% globally. And 56% of our products are already fully available through digital channels.', 'But very importantly, in the second half of the year, we did most of this. So there is an acceleration in this transformation, which actor is driving. Second step, really important, a common operating model across our banks, which allows automation at a much higher level, freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on value added services. Again, the education of resources and this is a metric will continue to track non-commercial activities, drop 1.5% in the second half of 23.', \"Again, a trend that is accelerating, you'll see more good news of this in the next few years. And the third incredibly strategic step is the out global tech platform. This is being rolled out in retail commercial. This is not a PowerPoint. This is happening.\", 'We are leveraging gravity, which is a award-winning backend where we partnered with Google and ODS, which is a cloud-based frontend, which is built by us, operating in open bank and tested and working open bank as a reminder is the largest native digital bank in Europe in 23 by size of deposits. All our retail and consumers are not just retail, but our consumer bank, the PCB, all will be convergent to this common retail global front tech starting in 24 with the US.', \"This is going to allow us to both drive customer growth but also better efficiency and therefore profitability in a sustainable way. So our consumer bank, this is digital consumer bank, the goal here is to become the partner choice for our customers and again, deliver superior profitability. Three main points here is an auto and consumer lending. We're offering best-in-class solutions for both commercial customers and consumers.\", \"We are benchmarking very much the same as in retail against the best players, whether banks or digital players. We want to be number one, fastest credit approval, fastest onboarding, more convenient, etc. The second point is we're and we've done this already for a couple of years, managing OEM relationships and our retail relationships globally. This is again a very important advantage.\", \"This means for example we can integrate the large digitally commerce players just once and of course that is something which is not available to many and expanding our partnerships in Europe, to Latam and the US. And third and really important with planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by deploying these common platforms and there's several. There's open bank of course, leasing, there's buy now pay later which we have built our own buy now pay later.\", \"It's already up and running in Europe and there's common front end with OEMs and dealers. Again we deployed a new pan regional leasing platform in 23 and very important in the US. Our own open bank ODS gravity platform is already technically up and running. We expect to launch in the US in the second half of 24 a fully digital offering nationwide and then in 25 to have all our US customers including our current retail customers on that same platform.\", \"Again this is a big driver already behind our numbers improving our efficiency overall but in specific in the US and would be an even bigger driver down the road. In our corporate bank we're building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five six years. We're leveraging our strengths, our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have more profitable customer relationships across our markets while maintaining the same risk profile.\", 'We will continue to pursue the same strategy focusing on customers more than 80% of our revenues are coming from customer revenues and with a very close coordination between the global local teams this is working really well.', \"We are now having strategic dialogues with customers that were mostly lending customers and that is something which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the US but there's also a very important opportunity to leverage the nine million existing group corporate and SME customers with these products and of course this will grow collaboration revenues. This will deepen relationships, will drive profitable growth, growing fees and support a capitalite model.\", 'I want to also point out some of the numbers on the slide where our corporate investment bank business is already growing faster than the balance sheet and you can see here how total revenues to AWS is improving to 6.7%. And last but not least this is a very predictable sustainable and no volatility business delivering consistent profitable growth for the last five, six years. A very different path from other players. So again the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger.', \"We've done that in London and we're now doing that in the US to make sure we can leverage our network, accelerate process automation. We will increase asset rotation and this all in all will drive efficiency and profitability improvements. In our wealth business we are aiming again to leverage our strengths. Our global model is aiming to capture growth by leveraging in the case of private banking. Our strong presence in Miami, one of the top Latin American private bankers.\", \"So we'll expand on that basis in the US. In our asset manager again leveraging to the strengths we have in vertical such as renewables infrastructure, the threat SMEs. Again this is something we've already been doing the last few years and in insurance focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like health savings also SMEs.\", \"In general again the same principles as for other global divisions, simplification in the case for example of our investment products and building together. I want to end by saying it's same as for corporate bank that private banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together and this is again a very very unique strength that drives profitability. Last but not least payments. In our payments business it's a large and growing and profitable industry.\", \"We have a unique position we're on both sides of the value chain. We will use this to become a global leader in payments supported by a current franchise of 165 million customers and 100 million active payment card customers. We're driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition. As of today this is also allowing us to grow in the open market because our products are competitive with the best.\", \"We're 16% of revenue coming from the open market and we expect this to continue to grow significantly in 24 and beyond. We are leveraging again as in the other divisions and optimizing our use of topics to meet customer needs in our acquiring platform GedNet which is already number three in Latam. It's adapting to customers payment ecosystems.\", \"We're also deploying our global cards platforms starting with Brazil which again will drive significant opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out. I want to just point to one specific number in Pagonex where activity increased 15% to reach 36 billion of total transactions and very importantly one of the key metrics we gave you in invested day which is EBDA margin which last year was 910% has risen to 22% this year. Sorry 25 almost 25% and 23 already. So we have focused on growth.\", \"You'll see the numbers but we're also focusing on profitability and we've done a big improvement, achieve a big improvement this year. So let me just give you a very specific example with the US of how these global platforms are being rolled out in different countries. I mentioned it already briefly but very important the first technical integration of our proprietary tech for consumer which combines the ODS, the open bank front end with our gravity backend will be launched in the US in 24.\", \"This is a fully digital savings account. We'll start with that in a year from now in the first quarter of 25.\", \"We'll complement this with the transactional offering and really important this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business including improving profitability and this is already showing in some of the numbers one of the key metrics we look at is retail deposit costs to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets but we also need the funding side.\", \"I want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in the US. As you can see in the screen we're not a full retail commercial bank as we're in Mexico or Spain or some of the big US banks. We're a consumer bank with a limited commercial multifamily business. We are targeting to grow in segments where we have local scale such as consumer commercial again or we can leverage a contribution of the group such as the CIVO wealth.\", 'Now with the platform on the retail side we will be much more efficient and an actor will share some of these big numbers you saw them at the investor day. We are a head of a plan in terms of improving efficiency on the retail and deposit catering side and just as I close in remark between 2019 and 22 Santander US distributed to our shareholders more than 8.3 billion individuals. So we are confident to reach our profitability targets of 15% in the medium term in a medium term plan.', \"So let me just finish by summing up I'm not going to go through the slide but I want to give you a sense of these five global businesses underweight in the Santander model just to reiterate the importance of retail and consumer. This is 70% of our revenues. This is where we have the most upside and we already are delivering on some of these platforms.\", \"I'm not going to go through the others but I just want to say that this model has already delivered improving profitability and growth 169 improvement in our ROT in 23. Again by moving to these five global businesses we'll unlock the full potential of our business model. It's all now going to be about execution and actor and I and all the teams are very focused on that. So again we aim to become as I said the most profitable punk in each one of our markets.\", 'So actor will now thank you through the performance in 23. Thank you and a good morning to everyone. Moving on to the income statement remember that as we always do we present growth rates both in current and constant euros.', 'As I know already mentioned we achieved a record profit last year with double-de revenue and net operating income growth but we also have a very solid quarter with profit growing 1% in euros even after seasonally effects in Q4 from the deposit warranty fund contribution in Spain and the bank levy in the UK which represent around 210 million post tax. On the line trends remain strong as profit excluding the seasonal factors will have grown about 8% in the quarter.', 'The differences between growth in euros and constant euros became more evident in the quarter as a devaluation of their long time peso in December introduce some distortions across the PNL. Remember that the full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in Q4.', 'Excluding Argentina profit would have grown 7% in the quarter in current euros and there is no material impact from other currencies so growth in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines. I will now take you through the main lines in the PNL in much more detail. Starting with the revenue there was a strong growth driven a custom revenue against this quarter which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter.', 'In the year it was primarily supported by native interesting common retail as we actively manage interest rates tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and the positive fee performance of CIV and payments mainly in Latin America. Moreover we have delivered double-deed revenue growth across most of the businesses especially those that benefit most from the network effects.', 'Revenue and the corporate center improved by more than 1 billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from the effects hedging. NII continued to be the main driver of our revenue growth. In 23 it was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back off. Basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in the Americas.', 'In terms of profitability we improved net interest marginal year-on-year and every quarter even in Q4 if we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in Argentina. This is mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than at weighted funding cost thanks to our discipline-reposted remuneration leading to our robust margin expansion.', 'Going forward we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in South America while the positive impact from interest rates in Europe starts to moderate. This is a great example of the power of the value of the application that we have.', 'Turning to fees in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and a weak consumer activity our net income grew 7% in constant euros compared to Q422 and 5% year-on-year. CIV and payments grew double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower activity or market volatility which against demonstrates the value of diversification.', 'We saw a strong growth in CIV across regions and products while Westrenthan are capabilities in the US. Total payments volume grew 22% year-on-year back mainly by Brazil, Europe and Mexico. On the other hand, consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the US.', 'In 24 we expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionality as we implement our common platforms and reap the benefits from our new operating model becoming the principal bank for our customers. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 424.1%. Saving from one transformation initiatives are already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization.', 'Cost as you have seen remain flat in real terms in 23 and driving the cost to serve as Anna mentioned earlier. This is reflected in efficiency gains of almost 2% edge points in the year led by Europe which improve 5% edge points driven by strong revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms. In North America and DCB, cost increases slightly in real terms reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects.', 'As mentioned, in queue for efficiency ratio is always affected by the DGF change. If we exclude it, efficiency is 43.7% fairly in line with that of queue 3 despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter. We expect that savings from one transformation will become more evident in 24 and onwards which together with the positive revenue outlook should result in further efficiency gains.', 'We are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. The efficiencies we have captured from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 112 basis points in efficiency improvements. For example, in the US we have already generated around 200 million in savings from transformation and simplification initiatives.', 'Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to the growth profitability and have delivered 28 basis points in efficiency gains in 23 alone. Multi-latings and multi-Europeans are initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model grew at very high rates with revenue increasing 40% in 23 alone. Finally, our global technology capabilities have already generated 32 basis points in efficiency so far.', 'Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a hundred and eighty seven million savings this year mainly driven by the deployment of gravity, new global agreements with vendors and implementation of new ITNOPS share services. Credit quality remains robust across all of our footprint and ended 23 in line with our expectation supported by our prudent approach to risk, strong-gabour markets and resilience in use car prices mainly in the US.', 'The MPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels. We met our cost of risk target ending 23 below 1.2 percent despite the impact of single-lane cases and additional provisions in Poland related to the Swiss franc mortgages. Spain continues to perform well. MPL improving 21 basis points and cost of risk is stable year and year supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions both metrics remained stable across the quarter.', 'In other European units the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expect it to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Normalization continues in the US and Mexico in line with expectations and group credit quality trends are confirmed in Brazil. A MPL ratio improved for the four quarter in a row and underlying cost for risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions.', \"Going forward we don't foresee signs of significant credit quality deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level. As we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product and country. Moreover our balance sheet is low risk the portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average LTVs.\", 'In 23 loans decreased 1 percent as higher rates reduce the credit demand and incentivize early prepayments which was especially evident in Europe. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and DCB. The posits continue to grow well up to 2 percent both year and year and in the quarter as the posits inflows more than offset savings used to prepare the mortgages. Growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates.', 'Our deposit base is diversified and has a stable using LCR criteria around 75 percent of our deposits are transactional which are a lot thicker and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits warranty schemes. Mutual funds rose 13 percent with road-based growth across all countries except the US following a year of instability in 22. Closing with the capital we maintained a CET1 ratio of 12.3 percent in Q4.', \"That's 0.2 percentage points up if we exclude the impact from the new EVA guidelines related to the current of the share bivots driven by strong growth, growth, organic capital generations or we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book written on risk-weighted assets of 2.7 percent. That's up from 2.6 percent in 22 equivalent to our ROTE in excess of 15 percent which will support profitability going forward.\", \"Finally we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization, improving the percentage of RWA's with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our investor-day target of 85 percent by year 25. These principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years and we are confident that our CET1 ratio will remain above 12 percent even after taking into account the final implementation of VailSill 3 in 25.\", \"That's all from my side, Anna. Thank you. Over to you. Thank you very much, Ektor. So let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions. So three very simple points. 23 was a very first strong year in our new face of value creation. By the way the best is yet to come. We grew customers, we increased revenue and profits double digit in all regions and businesses basically. Second a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model by one transformation to one Santander.\", 'There was also of course an improved operating context especially for our retail business and especially in Europe this year.', 'And point number three we have further strength and already very strong balance sheet increasing our CET1 ratio and very importantly with a very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our expectations once again all of this of course leading to the 15 percent growth in value creation and 21 percent increase in EPS and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share bybacks. Sorry can I get? Yeah thank you.', \"So what this means again is we've delivered once again in all on all our 23 targets. We're on track to achieve the 2025 goals that we communicated last year and very important as Ektor mentioned. You're just seeing the initial results of our transformation in our 23 results you're going to see much more coming in the next few years.\", 'I want to emphasize again that not only do we have solid foundations but these foundations are already proving an our model that we can deliver sustainable profitable growth increase returns to our shareholders leveraging our model. And taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer businesses absolutely critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years because it depends on us. So our guidance for 24 is 24 will be an even better year for Santander.', 'You can see here the numbers we are confident that our customer focus diversification will be differential this year vis-à-vis our peers. We have many engines and all of the engines are going strong with different focuses in the regions but all our global businesses going strong will continue to accelerate the implementation of a model in the retail and consumer to deliver again on these targets.', 'Just very briefly if you go down across the slide we continue to see revenue growth single mid-single digit in 24. This will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses. You saw actors presentation that this was the opposite this year. This year the consumer top line will be much stronger than this year. We will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in South America and Mexico with higher growth than Europe.', 'And very importantly much higher fees in many of our global businesses than we saw this year driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers. Again the one transformation would be absolutely key in delivering this supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency. In terms of cost of risk will be roughly flat against this year on an underlying basis ahead of this year we had someone off this year.', 'We said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite and this is still the case. There will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our current economic forecast.', \"And finally we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue but very importantly also on efficiency you can see we're continuing to target positive operating jobs with flat-touch costs for next year leading to a cost income below 43% and a return on tangible equity of 16%. So we're now happy to take your questions. Again thank you very much. Thank you. Can we start the Q&A session and have the first question which I believe is from Ignacio Largui. Thank you.\", 'If you wish to ask a question please press S-R-5 on your telephone. And our first question comes from the line of Ignacio Largui from BMP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the presentation and taking my questions.', 'I have two questions if I may link a bit to the revenue growth target the first one which is when we look to the mid-single digit revenue growth and you have just give a bit of clarity on that but just wanted to give a bit of sense of probably be the driver of the growth NII of fees in that customer engagement that you were commenting before and in terms of businesses which will be in your view the one that has a biggest potential into 2024. The second one is focus on course.', \"You've made a case for one transformation throughout the presentation. I would just like to get when when you mention flat is course what should be looking for going forward?\", 'What is the advantage that the global footprint will give Centunder in terms of that in translating into course growth and should we just expect that the efficiency again will continue towards say 42 in 2025 which if I remember correctly was the target of the strategy plan so we are not yet at the end of the journey we are just filled in in the process of that in that. Thank you. Sure. So in terms of revenues we of course deliver the very high.', \"Remember we've started a very strong year guidance for the three years was high single digit revenue with delivered double digit. What's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe of course with a with a higher rate but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses. You can see that for example in our transactions per customer which grow 10 percent year on year.\", \"As I said the retail Europe business has had very strong tailwinds. We do expect this to continue we have positive momentum in all of five global businesses. I want to be clear on this they're going to come from different regions and different sites I'll give you a high level and then maybe actor can give you a bit more detail.\", \"So again revenue growing at mid single digit the high level summary of the drivers of this on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business very high double digits in South America. Brazil Chile with a positive sensitivity to falling rates you've seen that already in Q4 and of course very strong momentum in Mexico.\", \"If you look at the other important global business consumer which this year suffered from the higher rates this year it's exactly the opposite so you're going to see consumer Europe and consumer in the US with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates again that's also going to be good for fees.\", \"Overall in fees they're going to be driven as sector said by customer growth increased transactionality and very important as we implement these global platforms you're going to see much more of that but again the high performing fee businesses will be corporate bank would be payments but maybe actor you want to give a couple of highlights for on revenues will take net interest income maybe in another question otherwise it's going to be too long a reply but net interest income we also are projecting that to rise again mostly in retail and consumer but actor why do you want to give some more?\", 'Sure, thank you.', \"Okay I mean you going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail CIV and consumer as Sanatol you know mid-singular digit and positive revenue growth in 24 you're going to see a little bit of the regions basically Europe moderating because of the rates and but we don't expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago you're going to see also that the main driver will be South American what's going on in Mexico and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the US okay so in that sense you'll see also the consumer business globally and then I have both in Europe in the US to grow benefited by credit growth and the progressives repricing that we have okay and you're going to see in CIV high income from financial transactions all right but asking you I mean answering your question in terms of fee we expect the income to grow and that's very important as Sanat was saying supported by a study of being the number one banktor for a customer this is quite important the moment that you become the number one bank to your customer fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially and that's going to help us quite a lot you can figure out a lot about connectivity several times but let me tell you why it's very important okay connectivity between the global businesses platforms and the countries is the one that drives extreme free generation okay that basically leads to double digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in 24 so we can reach the me to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees okay so that's very important and going to cost I don't know if I can come very quickly or if you want to come in Dana let me just give a high level and then maybe give a bit more detail so basically what's important in cost is that we we want to do better in cost next year than this year we're aiming for I would say flat-touch cost so the goal is to grow customers grow top line have positive operating leverage of flat-touch cost that is below 43 percent by the end of 24 you also said how do we see it in 25 obviously we see it better we as I said we intend to go step by step sustainably getting better we've had big improvements in 2324 we expect also improvements in 25 and reaching at least our target if not better I'm not changing the guidance I'm just saying we should do better than that so I want to be clear on that but yes we see many more benefits so and I want to again insist on the structural change in the model and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do we're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio but the cost to serve the customer we see a very very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year and we hope to carry that we have positive momentum in all our markets and again as I use the example of the US because the US is the place where we have an at-scale auto business but with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks we will get to be very competitive on the asset sorry on the deposit coloring side you saw in the in the slide that Ektor showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the US by 25 we've delivered 200 million this year we are of course investing investments in the US transformation will not be as large next year so you are going to see a much better performance for the US as a whole in the in 25 but what I said before we will migrate our existing retail customers in 25 to this new platform so in 25 and again this is only one example with the US driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running which is in the regulatory approval process so that should drive increased efficiencies and then again in Ektor slide you saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology so our investments one transformation investments in technology have reached 2.4 but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform so again we are we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and we'll get better you want to give it a bit more in the one transformation I think this is one very important point Ignacio to remember it about I mean one transformation is not just about the platforms there are two steps before it which are quite important where you see the impact on the cost one is simplification have you have seen in one of them as slides you saw the amount of products that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization okay so that's very important as simplification then the second is automation which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling products etc and also diminishing the cost ultimately means better service user experience less cost per transaction and client more revenue which is basically means profitability and then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through 24 25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Thompson from RBC please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my questions you've guided for UK Nimm to be down in 2024 can you quantify how much Nimm pressure you'd expect materialize this year in the UK versus the Q4 exit rates or if it's easier express this as an percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023 and secondly your structural hedge notion when the UK increased by seven billion or seven percent quarter on quarter that compares to a fall in current accounts of about 1.6 billion that's a little counterintuitive can you explain that this is driven by growth and savings deposits or rather is it because you manage the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than the catapetra approach and could you guide us please for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notion in the UK in 2024 thank you so yes let me just frame the answer in in terms of the UK Nim in the context of our retail business so again our overall retail business for 24 will do better than 23 driven more by the Americas in this case both Latin America but also the US because it's on the consumer side actually so what's very important is again single mid-single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall with mid-single digit growth overall también also for that interesting come within that the UK who this year has delivered a 13 I believe 13 percent ROT will continue to be double digit but will be lower profitability so as you as you know volumes and the top line net interesting come and let actor and Jose give you a bit more detail on that but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability so we have a very strong business in mortgages very strong business in current accounts in the in the UK at scale and competitive and for 24 we expect still double digit profitability but lower than this year what's important and again as we think about the one transformation that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the US in terms of the top line but it's going to help already on the coast side so we're guiding UK should be flatish cost next year with low cost of risk in a very very strong balance sheet and and so again leading to lower profitability overall in the UK but still double digit ROTE so in terms of I don't even want to give a bit more detail on volumes on on them in the UK sure I will do so but mainly I think it's important to tell you a couple of things asana said basically RITEL represents the bulk of the business in the UK mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have we anticipate in terms of you question in terms of cost flatish cost this is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing and also we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you okay it's important to understand that high rates and economics low down are continue to affect the long volumes and the market deposit growth continue to be so do okay so in 24-ganties it paid a challenging competitive environment as a one that you've saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks which is basically what's going on there mortgages rates have started to fall in December 23 you saw that following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then so we see a little bit changes in the in the volume the outlook is doing by increased competition also which will keep focusing on profitability as as Anna basically said and we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost at better levels and to find new revenue streams cost as I said flatish and as are we sold we anticipate and it's low and it's lightly lower ROT but I don't know Jose if you want to be the stock details yeah on the on the hedge in the structural hedge now I think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis it very much it may suffer some volatility due to materials etc if we look at the structural hedge in December 22 it was 108 billion pounds it is now 106 billion pounds and at that time the duration was 2.5 years and is 2.4 years that shows this very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable this is a structural so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits but again this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and like you said linked to our interest race sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts thank you can we have the next question please next question from Antonio Realio from Bank of America please go ahead morning it's Antonio from Bank of America I have two questions please one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy so you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 16% charity which implies an appropriate of more than 12 billion on current tangible value and this one has been growing so we hope that continues so it'd be implicitly guiding between 12 and 12.5 billion a profit they say which would be I mean it would be a strong number if delivered now I want to ask you to confirm if that's right but it would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year particularly Europe Brazil and the US actually when you talk about Europe if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness with this quarter that I think would help my second question is on strategy so you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the US and now over the years we've seen a few European international peers have ambitions change the allocation of capital industry AB businesses in the US which is almost systematically resulted in negative jobs and higher capital consumption can you talk us through what your expectations are here please and possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments thank you so in terms of the guidance again we're not going to give specific numbers but you can do the math I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues you know profits cost etc is that the key here is the operating leverage as I said this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control we control the top line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts and so what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model so we have a structurally lower cost to serve so we're going to work very hard on both of those as you know we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business so if you allow me I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage this is how we predict we have been managing this way forever by the way at the country level so we've been predicting retail commercial by country it's not anything different we're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that actor explain in detail so again we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 24 this is really important so we expect revenue growth in all our businesses retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80 percent so it's obviously very important both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single digit again our retail commercial as I said will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe but with exception of the UK the top line will grow in all the countries including Spain so revenues will continue to grow in Spain poll and Portugal so again very diversified and I would say very strong momentum in some cases more now fees than net interest income actor mentioned on the retail commercial side fees were negative to to flat this in 20 and 23 it should be much more positive in 20 in 24 including in Europe by the way because there's more activity we're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up so fees should grow in retail commercial what's going to be doing better and actor and I mentioned that already is our consumer business DCB and that is both in Europe and in the US so again here both net interest income and revenue growth should also should continue to grow fees growing much faster because of a higher activity so again very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more sensitive positive sensitive positive sensitivity to the to the lower rates the corporate investment bank will continue to grow very well mostly on fees as you've seen there we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not we're not planning to increase the size of the business we just wanted to be more profitable but not the size in terms of capital so that should remain basically where it is today it's a 13% of our revenues but the composition of our business is really different from our peers so a lot of transaction of banking a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with I mean both actor and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new in this new context right so we are very very focused on on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing what we are not either the best or could be the best at and and leveraging on our corporate relationships which are incredibly strong across Latin America Europe and increasingly the US so that is really the focus of the strategy there in terms of most specific guidance on specific countries I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more thank you thank you can we have the next question please next question from Carlos cobo from the state general please go ahead hi thank you for the presentation with a couple of questions from me one is on please and I'm sorry if you touched on this already feel free to refer to the call because I couldn't connect and to do simply the thing is that feeling going with the area where you have sort of under delivered the new premises stronger growth and fits how long only grown by mid-sing of the year 2023 I would like to understand why what do you think that was the case and where you bullish for 2024 were you again as back to grow by high single digits and understand the hiring in the US but all on that what is driving that is strong growth growth across the world and the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer best which retail it's just the quality of this comparative it we're looking at feeling like cost income ratios in both segments where you feel it would respect the digital consumer to be a more efficient business line than retain within network could explain what extent the cost income ratio in the digital consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development and will be a more normalized cost income ratio thank you so let me just very briefly answer the second question you're totally right there's a lot of upside in our in our consumer business remember that this is mostly Europe but also the US so we invested a lot in this especially on the retail side sorry on the wall retail and consumer the the the bank side is exactly the same back end but you're totally right so that should improve a lot next year so we actually targeting lower cost absolutely for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the US so yes absolutely that is a big goal we have fees so again we you know we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said but we're going to deliver because diversification because we're working on different angles and so you're going to get some lags one of the reasons you know our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity especially in Europe in some markets and that is a big driver of fees we accept we're targeting fees in our retail commercial to to turn positive next year so from zero growth this year as you saw an extra presentation that should be up maybe not much we're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank again as we said our diversification is a huge strength it's differential against most of our peers if not all of them so as rates stabilize and come down you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business not just on the cost side as I just explained but also in you know revenue growth net interest income and fees and fees should be you know high single digit in our consumer bank which is pretty big and yes absolutely our corporate investment bank should grow fees much faster that is one of the goals that is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the US because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships so you're going to see CIP fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year double digit for sure and you're going to see a lot of that in the US again so you will see the US as a country both consumer doing better CIP doing better the whole of the US going to you know above double digit returns next year but again it's and you're going to see hopefully hopefully you see payments also doing very well this year and next year and wealth management doing better next year than this year so that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in 24 thank you can we have the next question please next question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead yeah hi this is the fee from JP Morgan so my first question would be on US as a quality if I look at the NPL ratio in the US it increased from 4.2 to 4.6 coverage from 73 to 68 growth of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points if I look at the second hand core values that dropped over 30% since big value and in addition you're doing more eb financing as far as I can see given that tax right given that you had heard something at 20,000 eb vehicles in the US I think of 80% discount and the second hand core price is coming down so much and as a quality already showing signs of deterioration how should we think about the cost of risk in the US going forward and if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is and then my second question would be on the corporate center as far as I can see the first time you make a profit in the corporate centers in the global financial crisis you also made a positive net interest income in the corporate center so how should we think about the contribution from the corporate center going forward thank you okay let me take a couple of these high level and then I'll pass to Jose and actor but in terms of asset quality I want to say we see no signs of asset quality deterioration at all we are guiding and we're confident that cost of risk will stay around 1.2 that is probably a through the cycle number roughly so it could be lower it could be a bit higher but it should be a 1.2 we're not seeing really we had set previously 1% through the cycle we have a bit bigger balance sheets in in some emerging markets but you know we haven't given this but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that but I'd say around 1.2 what's important is that and this is not just Europe but it's mostly Europe a balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured in the case of Europe a lot of that is mortgages so 33% actually about total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs we're not anticipating a big change in in those numbers maybe a few basis points yes that's why we as you know the 1.13 is the underlying so we do have some space to grow there but this really is about basis points and the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolio is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet so again we are confident the economy will remain resilient if you look at the latest actually today the IMF just upgraded growth especially for Spain and some of our key economies and then our consumer portfolios and maybe actor wants to come into a bit more in the US but yes there will be some normalization but to be honest everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios Brazil is trending down the US is normalizing as we expected there will be some normalization in consumer next year but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year a led actor answer on that but let me just address the corporate the corporate center maybe that's for Jose but just to say that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center so in the corporate center for example we place our excess liquidity with ECB then we have transfer pricing and so again you should see some of that and I let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business for example in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal again part of that is let's say more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose and our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market-based transfer pricing and so you can see the actual commercial business and so some of those financial benefits of higher rates sometimes in our case as you've seen this year go to the corporate center so maybe you want to take the US maybe autos and then Jose you want to also expand on the corporate center sure so I mean really quickly on the US now our the US altowitnesses that we have has shown a very robust growth in 23 saves volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new relationship we have with some new OEMs that we have included in the portfolio and we have as you know a continued dominance in the Supreme Use Car segment which we are the leaders in the market now this volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained okay and also compensated for some declines from volumes that we had in other OEMs okay and then you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with the lead-wences and losses increasing seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter but it's still below the pre-pandemic levels okay so we expect the performance to continue through 24 and we see lower role rates of charge-offs and lower the link-wences driving that of the ship that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally US recovery in the US economy so Rob I wouldn't say recovery but robust US economy new vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre-pandemic period and just prices are falling but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have remember that is playing last quarter about about after 90 days the link-wences will still below pre-pandemic levels are about I mean 67% compared to about 90% so our outlook for 24 is a positive on the US auto sales growth in both loans and leases and a sustained income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term so we don't expect basically cost or risk to deteriorating the US sofi the NIAI of the Co-Presenter the NIAI of the Co-Presenter basically comes from the relationship between the Co-Presenter with a balance sheet in Spain and there are two different balance sheets in Spain one is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an independent bank so we charge to Spain the TILAC emerald costs which are the financing of the alco portfolio and a couple of other things so net commercial Spain balance sheet which are around 1.4 billion for those items and then we also have a CIV balance sheet in Spain that's group CIV booked in Spain plus the branches and like canna said we isolate the CIV business from interest rate risk so there is a an intra group transfer pricing for the CIV business that that is in the balance sheet of Spain and that's around 800 million so although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and the position of 308 billion the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate but then we charge these items that I explained making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIV against the TTI so obviously when rates are up we have at the Co-Presenter higher income from the TTI coming from CIV as rates will come down that should also come down thank you can we have the next question please next question from Francisco Riquel from Alanda equities please go ahead yes good morning I want to ask about the capital and I wrote the 60% you stick to your 50% payout ratio but yet the capital bill built is limited in 24 as per your guidance so I wonder what are the regulatory impacts that we should expect if any or what are the moving parts are impacting the 24 capital ratios and second here is the the 12% capital target the CET1 has been raised by 75 basic points in the last two years to 9.6 so regulatory escutors impose further counter-secular buffers so in this context do you think that the 12% capital target was Basel IV is still valid or would you be looking to increase this bar over time thank you so in terms of capital we are very comfortable with our level of current capital it's over 12% not 12 and just very important it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel III so again really important that we are comfortable we have ample buffers in terms of of the regulatory requirements the second point is that every year we're generating more and more capital organically we are compound we're compounder we're adding to equity and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important so this is allowing us enough capital to grow we have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet so as you can see the net AW growth last year was zero but increasing the front book profitability and so again we're aiming to in terms of capital build this year on a like for like basis we went from 12 to 1250 we're now accruing the buyback in December so that means 1230 that goes up from 12 and that's after increasing the payout to 50% as you know from 40 so again we're generating more and more capital we generated 10 billion of capital this year it's much much larger than the last few years we continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund out growth increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital and next year we will have the Basel 3 but the number that we're projecting for the end of this year is 1240 to 1250 from the 1230 for the end of 24 we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one again 1240 to 50 by the end of the year and on day one in January the same the final impact in 28 we estimate 25 30 basis points so that would mean that on January the first 25 we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road with the 1240 to 1250 that I'm saying anything else on the requirements you want to say on the P2R and P2G because no back very quickly we will generate between 10 to 15% of organic capital per quarter and we expect to have around 30 35 basis points of regulatory charges of which 20 will be up I mean front loading Basel 3 so that's why by the end of December 24 the ratio that we will publish will be already fully basal 3 compliant as Ana just explained and the capital ratio of 1240 to 1250 will be the same on December 31 and on January 1st 25 because we will not have any impact from Basel 3 on day one that impact will be absorbed in 2024 and in terms of the 12% and headroom well you know we're I believe one of the few European banks that under the stress test doesn't reach MDA I mean there's not very many the headroom is very comfortable we have hundreds of basis points I never know if we've given this number or not but we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic our risk appetite and the regulators so we're comfortable with our with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis which again we don't think that is the only number we should look at but on a nominal basis 12 months from now we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis a vis appears thank you can we have the next question please we are running a little bit out of time so can you make them as specific as possible thank you next question from Andrea Fri 3 from Mediapanca please go ahead first question is on the NII prospect have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the NAA trajectory in your representative geographies can you please update us on your net trust income sensitivity with the forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration the second is a more conceptual question you hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability while capital is growing yet a consensus estimate are hesitant to meet your guidance and valuation stays on demanding what do you say to the skeptics on something there thank you what I say to the skeptics look at and what I tell everybody every time they evaluate something is look at the numbers look at the track record if you look at a track record that's why I showed a slide by the way the NII will answer Jose will answer that on the hedge but basically it's I think you know we we have gotten some recognition this year way we need way way more absolutely you know we are distributed to shareholders 10% of our market value 5.5 that is five times to shareholders what we gave nine years ago but very importantly on a per share basis as we said this year we're up 50% as we increase the payout 50% cash dividend per share I mean any number you look at is at the group level is I think sorry to say this but impressive but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years so what I would say is just look at the numbers and that's what we're doing look at a track record look at a model look at our diversification I think it's going to be and you know as we are preparing for this call if you look at the group by global business it's a much more simple to understand group but very importantly by managing the bank now by five global business we have a lot more upside for many more years and this is the key the market will see this year we're launching our own tech platform in the US this is totally differential for the US of course but also for the group there is and and this is really important a plan to deploy as Ektorset common business model common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank so you know as well you know the numbers your recommendations are higher I think you're still way short by the way of how we see things but that's fine so you're not even half as bullish as we are we own a lot of shares and I think just to answer the last question the market tends to look and this is the feedback we've got from a couple of long-term Santander investors they look at us through the rearview mirror and if you look at Santander through the rear view mirror the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension and not all our peers but our goal is to outperform all our peers don't get me wrong is 23 and what they tell us is you need two years of consistency and you will see that I am very confident we will see that Ektor and I are working together really well we like what we do we believe in this company we have a great team we just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run an open bank platform we're going to deploy our national digital platform in the US this year all our customers from our current retail bank in the US will be on the new platform in 25 so just you know we'll keep on delivering and we'll keep on buying shares at 18% ROI so I'm sure this is something which we'll get to Jose can you answer the instructions Andrea and I and Prospect sensitivity etc you're right we have a hedging of our very more mortgages which is basically expired already it will expire in by April it will expire so the sensitivity that we're going to have next year it's going to be the actual sensitivity of the portfolio there are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity one is let me give you the sensitivity to a drop a parallel drop of a hundred basis points in Spain it would be minus one billion all things being equal another way of looking at it is the way you post the question which is if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024 which is probably not realistic NIA is positive around 500 million okay so so we will still have positive reprise in next year with costs of deposits remaining flat but again that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion so I give you the minus one billion a hundred basis points drop by 500 million with cost of deposits flat thank you can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Fereto from UBS please go ahead yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions too very quick ones first one is if you can give us your best approximation of what to expect from Argentina in terms of earnings in 2024 and the second one if you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the UK and if you can give us your view of how that this cash basically can develop and what kind of restructure and charges you know impermanence actually might have to face in 24 and 25 on the basis of this thank you so Argentina a bank in Argentina is doing incredibly well obviously the exchange rate has meant a few basis points of effect on a capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers I believe for next year and how we're going to report is going to be leaving Argentina in current so you can get a better view of what really is going on so this is really important we report in constant when you look at the performance of the business but we leave Argentina in current in terms of the P&L it's not really material except for this volatility across the from no and the effect on capital was a few basis points I think two three basis points in Q4 Argentina we we're not anticipating nothing very different for for the next year in terms of the UK it's still early days it would not be a significant I mean we I'm going to say it's a significant we don't really know but it should not be a big number because it's not a really big portfolio FCA is looking into it so nothing really that right now we're concerned about thank you can we have the next question please next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley please go ahead hi thanks for taking my questions to two quick ones hopefully on Brazil obviously very strong growth in NII can you maybe talk us through that strong growth I see the cards seen a pickup in growth maybe you can update us where you are in that card growth strategy in versus your your the run rates you've given us in the past and will the 100% cap on rate on loan rates how will that affect you in in 2024 and second very quick one can you give us what tax rate you're assuming for your 2024 and 25 targets and any color you can give us in particular in Brazil and the US for how how to think about in those regions thank you so let me answer this quite a few questions I'm going to answer very high level and we can then address some of the others in the coming quarters but basically Brazil is as you know as you've seen it's doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters we're expecting a much higher profitability in 24 in the high teens actually cost actually growing less in in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in Brazil we can grow and actually grow our cost-based less because we're investing together revenue growth net interest income you know between double digit and yeah all double digit growth in all the top line and efficiency ratio improving again so very strong performance anticipated for 24 across all the different global businesses but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards just I don't think any you want to say about cards all I can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually 18 months ago you seeing that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down we anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year and that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards we will start to grow again but again the growth in Brazil is across all the global businesses not just the retail but also the consumer CIV and all the others in terms of the tax rate for 24 no I mean just one one comment on growth in Brazil if you look at the consumer finance which includes everything in Brazil this year it was the portfolio together we say I did agree the least just 2.2 percent and obviously as rates come down that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average so if we are expecting more or less you know very low double digit growth in loans in Brazil next year this portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average and we would expect corporate loans corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average so that shows the change in mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion together with the sensitivity that we have to rates on the tax rate I don't know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards you can follow up Jose or Boronja but there is an effect in the tax rate from the which is actually a business business line of business quality revenue because of the electric vehicles in the US you're seeing that some of that already in Q4 it's actually as I say it's a business but you're seeing that through the through the tax line so that maybe you want to give some color on that later on thank you can we have the next question please next question from Marta Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much my first question do you expect positive jobs in the US in 2024 and then I guess you are in 2025 I'm interested in 2024 and then second following up on your strategy in the UK you're shrinking you're saying that you is going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposit but you're expecting your group platforms to watch the revenue line over time I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the end point in the UK is because of the industry could have claimed beneath a bank you gathered the deposits you give mortgages in a very challenging and a very competitive environment so unless you throw money into your UK business you're not going to do anything so what is the plan thank you so the answer in the US yes absolutely we're expecting positive jobs in the US so we are basically growing the top line in revenues more or less flat fees efficiently racial improving cost flat to flatish I would say and I just wrote it that is actually a 12% going up in a quite a significant way so yes absolutely positive jobs in the US in terms of the UK strategy and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries and these are the UK and the US where our US we call it it's in retail because we have current accounts of mortgages but I would say it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal Spain Mexico Brazil and that is really the strategy so actors working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually you know focus on profitability so we are not as you say I think use the word throwing and we never throw capital around with total respect we are super efficient and we focused on profitability not just in the UK but across and we are putting as you can see more capital at work in the more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets very important this is a very granular work that is actually led by Ektor and Jose where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability UK is one of them so again full focus on profitability you can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain for example you can see that in the front book that actor showed the front book this year is above 2% 2.3% raw oil I remember correctly we are being very disciplined again not just by countries and global businesses even by portfolios and this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years all right um so we're going to take the last question now um we do realize that there are a couple of others in the queue but the investor relations team will be at your disposal for any for any questions that you may have so can we take it the last question please last question yeah I think so thank thanks so can you hear me yes go ahead please oh thank you um yeah first of all thanks for still disclosing the the country reporting which is very useful to us as analysts thanks for that my question relates to the to the customer growth which was one of the KPI's to drive scale effects you've added 5 million customers 265 the target is 200 million until 2025 to what extent this is dependent on the rollout of the fully digital offering and to what extent without then backload some of the revenue growth that you expected to see until 2025 so yes absolutely in a consumer bank especially the deployment of the platforms including senior and euro should drive a much faster more customer growth in the next few years but very important sometimes I mean our definition of customers is net customers so some of our peers give gross customer we give net customers and so again as we improve an actor mentioned that several times as we improve our service our experience and become the number one bank customer rotation should be less on the retail side we should accelerate the consumer growth but in any case the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues whether and again think that the revenues are coming with the active customers more than total customers so total customers drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank and that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years so I think there's a few more if you don't mind begony on the team we'll address those again thank you all very much I just want to reiterate actor and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about continued delivery on our targets and we see an even better 24 for Santander thank you very much\"]]\n",
