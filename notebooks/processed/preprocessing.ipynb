And then just separately to squeeze in \\u2013 you guys took some securities losses again this quarter.

Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching\\u2026\",\n          \"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace.

And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website. But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Garc\\u00eda Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion. That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions. We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate. Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends. In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year. While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight. First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online. We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth. Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jos\\u00e9 or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please Jos\\u00e9. Jos\\u00e9, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance. Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%. So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year. Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment. This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue. We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses. We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer. Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re\\u4f0eed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re\\u4f0eed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year. This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it. And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25. So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail. Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see. I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jos\\u00e9 to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments. With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect. Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good. We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect. I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail. Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds. Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well. For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important to understand what the model changes about. The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I. If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you. Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask Jos\\u00e9 to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina. In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points. And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead. Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks. First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits. Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please. There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead. Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken. Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates. Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you. Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye you\",\n          \" Good morning, everybody. And welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, etc. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be as always available in the Excel sheet and reports that is published in our website. But now to the presentation, I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Ektorgrisi and our CEO, Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Garc\\u00eda Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your phone. And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Ektorgrisi. Hector, the floor is yours. Thank you, Begonia. Good morning, to everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander, positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of 2.9 billion. That's an 11% increase versus Q1, 23. 9% in cost and euros, as Begonia said, excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain, recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record our customer focus and scale are driving profit-able growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-deed year-on-year in cost and euros and that supported by all global businesses and the regions. We are executing on an transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6% and net operating income has grown double-deed year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on valuable equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet, with some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profit-able growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation. Tina Ploseviden per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased Tina by more than 4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth boasting current euros and in cost and euros. Although, there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is incurring euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. Strong top and number one, strong top line performance driven both by NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost-remined flat-tissued real-terms in language expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and low-loss provisions continue to normalize as suspected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a $335 million charge related to the temporary 11-spane, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit grows 14% year-on-year, in playing a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into this once later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year. We are well-entracted to achieve our 2014 and 2014 targets, targets that we comfortably rate the rate. Good business dynamics supported high-single digital revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we are investing for the future through one transformation, and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remains fairly stable, in language target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully-loaded C-T1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown or reasons organically, and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout, and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and our RoteGrew year-on-year, 16.2% put in also on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we are achieving these results back by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continue to grow well, with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of 237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization new operations and implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. A business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech, this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor-day targets. This operation leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year respectively. In CAB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continue to go as strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally, in payments where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide we are seeing good activity trends. In Q123, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now, let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation. As operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year. While Santa and their key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions, we have a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform, Continuting Q1, and gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile, and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe, and at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following 30 things to highlight. First, double digit revenue increase driven by good performance both in NNI and FIS, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost-under-control. Flat in real terms, as the benefits from our transformation, in some units, are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly, with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing 3.17.6%. In consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to peer-direct out-of-players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online. We are also progressing well-on simplification and automation, supporting a 15-basis-point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing our cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced a launch of Open Bank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with not operating income growing by 7% year-on-year driven by the following three elements. First, an increasing revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good and I.I. performance and 22% figure of mainly for insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in Europe and the US, though it still below the historical average as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are re-inating at high rawas. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double-deget, year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an area of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline, with markets also performing strongly across asset classes. As a result, revenue and CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as synergy transition, healthcare, and more others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continue to support great-treat organization and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-wide, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 23, making Q1 24 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for world management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, EuroMoney once again named most the best private banking in the time and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. A tributeable profit grew double digit on the back of a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from Santa and the RSA management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year and rotor rose nine points to 80 percent. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than a hundred million carts group-wide and merchant-acquiring. We are gaining market share as when friends are strengthening, gets its value-proposition for customers through continued product development at greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where GEDNET has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the Pagonex Global Platform to leverage on the group's scale. Around one billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy PLART, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in PLART and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million carts in dual-running Brazil and we have launched a friend-some-family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good-or-deline revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning carts dropped 22% year-end-year profit growth. Finally, Pagonex Aveda margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set our last investor day. Cost efficiency and capital optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-deach shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Roto was 16.2% if we analyze the Spanish Bank levy, up 93 basis points year-end-year reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Aveda per share rose to 17 cents, of 14% year-end-year supported by a strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the buy-back programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our discipline capital allocation and the impact of the share buy-backs. Buy-backs continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buy-back that is currently underway, we will have bought back around 11% of our standing shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I leave you now with Jos\\u00e9 or CFO to go in through more detail on our cartel-leaf financial performance. Please Jos\\u00e9. Jos\\u00e9, thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I'll go into more detail on the groups, P&L and capital performance. Let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant euro, and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso de evaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter and quarter. Let me also, as Cector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant, where we present here as constant, is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant, is growing 13%. NIA is growing 20%, instead of 16%, fees would be up 8%, instead of 5, or total revenue would be increasing 12%, instead of 9%. So, we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. Let me go to the main components of the P&L. As Cector said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer, and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%, actually 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NIAI, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-and-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management. Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no as-equality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-and-year. Driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary living in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of these tax living in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter, and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right hand side, excluding this impact profit would have increased 14% year-on-year, or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double rates, with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions, and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses, and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIV also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-deyear revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends. Year-on-year, as both Pagan and Extankards are growing, if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Ektor has explained. Finally, at a corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NIAI, which contributed, which continued, growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group Sennai. It went up 16% year-on-year, on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico, and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer, and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by high yields on assets, as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of the interest rate environment. This gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain, thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration in Europe, and the positive rep writing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue. We expect to benefit from the interest rate cut in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low-finch income growth in general, because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of 3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing a strongly quarter and quarter, despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses. We retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer, fueled by insurance, CIV also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses' business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter, and they aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 23 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer. Scores remain stable at around 6.5 billion for the last three or four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms, despite the lack of effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, remain well under control in retail, consumer and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5% reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CAB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in terms of our liquidity, which remains robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remains stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's long-lost provisions, which are under lying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, with represents around 36% of groups' long-lost provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5% of points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, as trends in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year, Spain will be stable and in the UK will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital are fully loaded capital ratio, remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3% back by a strong capital generation and significant risk weighted asset mobilization. This quota we generated 32 basis points organically, after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary living Spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charged for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIV models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with implementation of Basel 3. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available for sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our discipline capital allocation is resulting in a new book, Return on Re\\u4f0eed Assets, of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last years. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to 30 billion in re\\u4f0eed assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, Dr. Overti. Thank you Jose. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first and strong and increasing organic at capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continue improving our profitability. Investor-day target, just to remember you, was 15 to 17% rotate. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off, Q124 was another strong quarter supported by a recurring customer revenue growing in high single digit backed by strong performance in other businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q124. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in 2025. Supported by first of all is important to acknowledge that it is supported by global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good and eye performance in the year. This is based on first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least another quarter. Second, enjoying the benefits for the interest rate cuts in South America and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's rotate improved from 16.2% in Q124 and was expected to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All in all, our TNAF plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Hector and thank you, Jose. We can start the Q&A session now. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone. We already have the first question from the line of Francesco Rican from Alandra. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. First is on NIA in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detailed the main assumptions behind it. And then how big a cliff shall we expect in 25 with the current jail car. Also connected to this day in the court for example, because the Spanish liquidity in the stand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to the access the combined NIA performance of Spain and the corporate center. And my second question is on capital after the 20 beeps from Lodete in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 beeps left for January the first 25. So meaning that you are already in line with that 12% performance. Post Basel IV, I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect. And where do you see your C-E-T-1 target in the context also of potential contestically compacted. Thank you. Thank you for Francesco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NIA basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail. Do do the fact that we have really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say and as I commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see. I mean C-I-B is also performing quite well and the commercial business too. And that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 24 all along in NIA in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jos\\u00e9 to give you the details. Thank you, actor. Let me compliment actors comments. With the current forward rates, as he said, we see NIA is still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NIA in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NIA in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 24 relative to 23 with a current level of interest rates and forward rates. We see actually NIA up in Spain year-on-year. In the corporate center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increase the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NIA in the corporate center to gradually perform better as future effects charges might be lower. Capital, Basel 3. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel 3. There are a few elements, well several elements of uncertainty to European banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the US has stated that they will not implement a fartyb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel 3 rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel 3 rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1st, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EVA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EVA mandate is that it aggregates all the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesn't guarantee that all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimates for a very low day one impact of Basel 3. So in January 1st, the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and facing once Basel 3 comes into effect. Counter-sickical Galbafers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk weighted assets for the group. So any counter-sickical Galbafer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will be 12 basis points, if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember however, from the time counter-sickical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, it is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. Most likely will not impact 2020-5 capital requirements or they might impact year end capital requirements in 25 but not 24. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Question from Ijana Fiolargi from BNP Pariba. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have to if I may. The first one is on feed and feed generation in the quarter was quite good. We're looking into the coming quarters. What should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the group of four months of CAB and World Management and Insurund? The link to these Ijana Fiolargi is one to see if there was any kind of one of in the feed's reported in the US which jumped a lot, quarter and quarter. The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand the organic generation that you expect. I mean as profitability improves I feel that the 10 to 15 beeps has passed to the a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able to add to an additional growth of our other delays. Thank you. Thank you Ignacio. Okay in terms of feed generation okay we have as you can see in a strong Q1, 14% quarter and quarter that's an 18% quarter and quarter growth in retail. Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and is continued to do so. Okay you talk about the standing performance in CAB that's 39% quarter and quarter that's a record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one off whatsoever in all the bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from from all kinds. Okay in wealth we have also a very strong recording activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that will help us out. Okay consumer growth came mainly from Europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall help us as well. For 24 respect that trying to continue as I told you the fees are growing to reach mid to high single digit this not an official target but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see this is most to do than by the increase in CAB with the connectivity we have with wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality and most of the global businesses with experience double the fee growth in 24 as we change a business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important to understand what the model changes about. The model changes exactly about that when I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we just to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that we're executing today so you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWA's with that then I leave on the capital question to Jose thank you. Hello Nacho. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we can keep reswitted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low reswitted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds 15 per quarter than extra quarters we still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management so net net with all of that I you know we still see 1240 to 1250 capital ratio by year end. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Mongols. Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. Ektor you gave details on the fee performance I just wanted to circle back to it to US again in Brazil in the US so is this I know to you you said there's no one off but is this the run rate we should expect going forward how's the pipeline looking I realize there's no one off but but the maybe seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in Brazil there was a renegotiation or in Paronex I suspect that's why the fees are a bit lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on an I.I. If you you thanks for your comments on Spain can I invite you to comment on Brazil and UK Brazil obviously very very strong sounds like above this sensitive you gave can do you expect what do you expect for a year can you continue strong and on UK just when when you think it can bottom thank you. Thank you Alvaro yes I explained you the performance in the US is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline is and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend I mean how the market basically goes but what I can tell you is that the the the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the market helps us I'm sorry to repeat myself in what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly what you were saying I mean we had a and one of in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one 95 million euros so that basically slowed us a little bit but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice and I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what I saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of NIA in Spain Brazilian the UK I could tell you that the indications we get at the beginning is that with rates continue the way they are this is going to give us I mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in Brazil so it's important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and NIA in Spain already Jose gave you a very good explanation but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one in terms of the UK let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is I mean as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to throw to improve their the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay NIA down 4.4 in the quarter similar as I said to the UK banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of Ross but we're taking actions to improve the NIA we're doing pricing changes we're announced both the deposits and lending in the first quarter and we'll try to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and acid mortgage spreads also are improving the uke market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so you wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK and the cost of risk is basically where you will man I mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that I'll ask Jos\\u00e9 to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NIA so in Brazil NIA should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that year on year we should see mid to high double digits tens no double these tens growth in NIA and in the UK the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter with as sector said we've seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarter on quarter so year on year for the full year you know NIA down mid single digits something like that with all of these estimates we believe NIA for the group should grow quarter on quarter this year so sequentially we should see higher NIA every quarter this year and year on year customer revenue we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so year on year customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 23 thanks thank you both can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Ferreto from UBS please go ahead hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there too both on the US I don't think I've seen that slide used to have been last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% road hit target in the US so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number on what the main drivers and the main initiatives have seen open ban being launched in the US recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the US I mean you used to give some information around PDs charge of being the past as well I had don't think I've seen those actually so forgive me if I've missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US as a quality the link is on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you thank you Ignacio okay in terms of the US a particular thing is first of all I mean as you know we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is the business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the CIV side to be for our presence there and we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for non-US alliance okay so those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% rotate and we I believe it's gonna be more towards the end of 25 that we're gonna be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the US let me explain exactly how the 20s first of all we still see a strong labor market in the US okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in the linkages above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID that remember pre-COVID was about 90% we went all the way down to 59 percent today is more around close to in between mid 60s okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expected to continue to be like that over the end of the year we don't see any surprises and the way that the portfolio has behaved okay so it's circa around 2% that's where I see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability we're being very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40 percent prime and near prime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you thank you Hector can we have the next question please next question from Carlos Pesoto from Gacha Barg BPI please go ahead yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the US on the outlook for for NII how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did on the cost of risk in the UK it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first key level is something we're currently throughout the year thank you very much sorry thank you Carlos first of all on the outlook of NII in the US I see it flatish okay let's see how volumes basically turn out and as I explained before since we are very much focused on profitability and also in the in capital allocation I see that is going to be flatish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the UK sorry the cost of risk in the UK as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro I see it very flatish I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points the most so below 2 percent sorry below 20 basis points so if I may add we as I said we see no as a quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure there's no signs of as a quality deterioration so we could extrapolate but we've seen in recent quarters in the UK we could extrapolate for the rest of the year thank you can you have the next question please from Marta Sanchez Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so the bank of Spain where to introduce the CCIB of 100 Bips that is 25 Bips for you but that would leave your 12 percent fully loaded correctly to year one ratio leaving or implying an MBA buffer of just about 177 basis points which is pretty low for European standards standards so do you think that 12 percent fully loaded perfectly one ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the UK so the bottom line is now 25 percent smaller than last year is the shrinking on a continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly at clarification on on a previous question the revenue growth that you are for seeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you let me answer your final question oh we are we are estimating almost or around double digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as I explained we believe this is the best the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation and Argentina. In terms of capital what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said no I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 1240 to 1250 okay and I really do believe I actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12 percent after base on three I would be that would be the main points. And again the country's call buffer will be implemented in a year's time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once you know the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points in the A with our actual capital buffer. Thank you can we have the next question please. Next question from Brita Smith from autonomous please go ahead. Yeah other thanks for taking my questions I've got two questions you some more optimistic on that interesting come in Spain, Ukraine, Brazil but let us know when no change for your official group targets for 2024 what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then technically you got it to double digit customer revenue growth and the group our revenue target Smith single digit what's the delta year for 24 thanks. First you know as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was six country million we have 1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51 percent in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was six hundred million that's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the P&L obviously we don't control so that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for I mean the total revenue target for the group meet single digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits. Brita in terms of of of the revenue overall as you were saying an NNII yes I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and I rate rate that we're going to meet the 16 percent rotting that we basically have announced. Onward I believe that is it looks good and it looks promising but I rate the guidance that we have gave you. Thank you can we have the next question please. There's a question from the line of Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead. Yeah hi here is the fee from JP Morgan thanks very much for taking my question so I'm also just wondering about the flat cost guidance for 2024 does it still hold your cost for up by percent in constant euro seven percent in current euro so I should be thinking about the cost guidance I did previously gave and then my second question with the on rate sensitivity 200 basis for change in rates if you could just remind us what does mean in sporespan Brazil the UK you ask all the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place that the the radius that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide five you say that your new you only got five million new customers year and year but at the investor day a year ago you target it I think 75 million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have five million new customers or or does it make a difference and and how do you plan to get to the 75 billion new customers that you got it for at the master day a year ago thank you thank you so if you let me answer you the the last question first I mean what we've been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer basis and even though we are growing quite hard we've been cleaning up that and basically that's at the end what's going to be telling I mean moving up towards then the number of customers that we are able to include we're going to be working on that and both I mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost I was basically as I explained you I mean this remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen that's plus one percent quarter in quarter if you exclude Argentina that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down that's plus 2% year-on-year and real terms and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 24 target of below 43% cost to income and I believe that we're going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are you coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplified it we have 10,000 different products today we're down to 7,500 and automation which is a very important part and I was explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better that we've been doing okay that's basically the efficiency gaze if you look at that simplified product simplification gave so 17 basis points year-on-year of savings automation is helping us out 58% of product services are now digitally available okay that's 2% each points in help versus December 23 and if I can tell you of an example the US have captured 10 million inefficiencies just in Q1 alone and that's 210 million since we started the process in 22 and that's just in consumer and retail so it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely cost-coding exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year now in terms of race sensitivity there hasn't been any change in all countries in most countries but Europe let me let me in euros let me let me explain so in the US is plus minus 150 million in Brazil plus minus 150 million in the UK is plus minus 200 but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the UK a structural hedge in the UK is 113 billion pounds with an average duration of 2.4 billion it was 106 billion pounds in December so 113 2.4 years average duration and in Spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination by an alcohol portfolio we now have 30 billion alcohol in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the 240 billion resuited assets 50 billion 250 billion average earning assets we have in Spain 60% is floating 40% is fixed that significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe sorry so just to be more precise what I was saying is the cost income is going to be below 43% okay that's efficiency that we have set for a year and we wait to rate that and efficiency this quarter was 42.6 okay but let me so let me just finish the NIA sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5% and we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we as we know in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher NIAI and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken. Thank you can we have the next question please let's question from Andrea Fintri from Medioanka please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question the first is on your profitability targets you're about 16% ROT guidance for 2024 implies more than 12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and we've tailwind in H2 that you indicated in Brazil in the UK where they get import volume in consumer with lower rates. Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 ROT outlook. Second question if you could give us a target for 2024 group costs in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in 2025? Finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you. Thank you Andrea are you right I mean we are confident that we're going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROT for the year and we set correctly in our investor we set 15 to 17% over 25 and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today I write to you that we're going to be at the 16% ROT that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have set is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been we've been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said I mean if you said it is you saw it's quarter and quarter is around 1% top and we're going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have and on them on what I presented on retail you see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and I believe that the trend would continue like this so I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flatish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love that business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil I could tell you Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have 222 different products per market the idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be more more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so that's a huge opportunity as you say the the other side of the coin is that we have JB's that in place on the long-term basis mainly in Latin America and in Spain and Portugal and that will continue to have them over the years because they're a long-term I would like to I would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the JB's and we need to respect what we have there but as you say this is a huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantage and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the law penetration in the different markets thank you thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Tom's from ABC please go ahead thank you for taking my questions at their four-year results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of motor finance in the UK and since then one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue used to expect no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue and then secondly we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you ROT in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you I mean first of all on the UK motor finance issue I mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remain with the regards to the existence scope and the timing of any positive possible outcome there so as a result we're not getting a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and I don't believe until basically this I understand there is an expert basically running through that so I don't believe that we can give you an idea what I can tell you is that so far we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far we've been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the UK I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my viewing that sense thank you can we have the next question please this question from Chris Hallem from Goldman Sachs please go ahead yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on Basel 4 and then on Argentina so I'm I hope to say thanks for the colour earlier on Basel 4 I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame you know let's say towards July 1st 2026 and you mentioned the delegated act provisions for frtb here in Europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it i.e if we only get parts of Basel 4 in January the first 2025 and then frtb follows on July 1st 26 how much would that change the phasing of the capsule headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on Argentina so clearly it has quite a distorted effects on the group figures and then you know there's the associated cost of hedging and it's below five percent of group earnings so I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina I guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic so the answer to the first question yeah when when we've always mentioned Basel 3 but when we gave the impacts we were including a frtb you're right so when we said where day one impact of a of Basel 3 was Basel 3 plus a frtb isolated is 10 basis points so if a frtb gets postponed we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates I hope this clarifies the matter thank you in terms of Argentina I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on if if if Argentina basically can sustain what's going and and we're trying to be positive about what could happen I don't believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and we'll just wait and we'll we'll continue operating our business our business is doing well it's very good structured is that is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on thank you can we have the next question please the last question comes from Andrea Filtre from Medioanca please go ahead yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024 the 16 percent of the implies over 12.3 billion can it be more specific about what number you're actually targeting and then you're on the cross the same story I'm asking for a nominal euro deliminated that group cost target for 2024 thank you thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost but so again for net income 13 percent sorry 16 percent return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 north of 12 billion it's what it's the conclusion of this 16 percent we agree with that and in terms of cost we're looking at a cost growth which is going to be around 2 percent this year to 2 and a half percent this year going forward if we've discussed we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but as the internal target we have we haven't given any guidance for 25 but what I'm saying is that long median term our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in 2024 close we think we could be closer or there in 2025 but it's too early we are still you know in early 2023 sorry 2024 so we will give you these guidance in due course but again our medium-london objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms thank you very much thank you Hector and thank you Jose I believe there are no more questions thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance our investor relations team is as always at your disposal for any further questions you may have goodbye turtle\",\n          \" Good morning everybody and welcome to Van Kursenthenders Conference call to discuss our financial results for the first nine months of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that during the presentation when we refer to global and network businesses we are following the definition which was given during our investor day last February as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in January 24. I am joined here today by your CEO Mr. Rector Grisi and our CFO Mr. Jos\\u00e9 Arteacantera. Following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question please press star and five on your phone. With this I will hand over to Mr. Grisi, Hector the floor is yours. Thank you, Vigonia. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will focus on today. First I will talk about our nine months results in the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our investor day. Jos\\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with a few closer remarks. As you can see we had another strong quarter demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business model even in times of market volatility as well as a solid execution of our strategy. With the lever record profit of 2.9 billion that's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in 22 that's 26% in constant euros. Profit for the first nine months of 23 was 8.1 billion up 13% in constant euros driven by strong customer revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year supported by all global businesses and all our unions. Commercial activity remains solid we have the nine million new customers in the last 12 months bringing the total to 166 million. We continue to advance towards a simpler more integrated model through our one transformation which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result our efficiency ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44. Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15% while earnings per share improved by 17% year-on-year supported by profit growth and share buybacks. We further strengthen our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter even after the adopting the share buyback underway and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder valuation and attractive remuneration. Tina plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months and we have increased the cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year. Moving to the income statement as always we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros. Profit increases strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters supported by first of all strong top-light performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as cost increase well below revenue reflecting our transformation efforts. Double digit growth in net operating income to more than 24 billion. Normalization of loan-loss provisions in line with our expectations and as I mentioned in the previous slide this trend resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q223. We will now go into more detail on this once later. These results maintain some track to achieve our 23 targets, targets that we rate the rate. First of all good business dynamics led to double digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range even with investments in one transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as suspected and capital ahead of target with C-T1 improving quarter-on-quarter. A rotate is close to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at the end. Looking closer at capital and value creation our C-T1 ratio has grown year to date from 12% to 12.3% backed by a strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continue to grow our shareholders value creation which was up 12% in the first nine months of the year and we're increasing our shareholders remuneration with payout up to 50%. In September the board of directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results which is being executed as follows. A cash dividend of 8.1 cents per share to be paid in November 39% higher than the equivalent in 22. A share buyback program of up to 1.3 billion that is currently on the way. Since 21 and after completing the current program sometimes that will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares, buybacks through share buybacks. We are progressing in our new phase of value creation and transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. One transformation which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for retail and commercial business across all of our geographies will lead to improved customer service efficiency and profitability. In simplification we have reduced the number of products by 8% in 23. That's almost 800 less products. In digitalization we're making good progress with our digital sales service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by 16%. We have set up a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just six minutes to complete. Since it's launched in July we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the US we have already captured around 114 million in savings from transformation and simplification. As you can see on this slide the initial efficiencies from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 117 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 39 basis points in efficiency gains. For example, multilatinas and multi-Europeans initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model are growing at very high rates with revenue up by 50% in 23 year-on-year. In private banking we continue boosting collaboration with CIVN corporates which has generated over 160 million revenue this year or 30% percent. In Brazil we have acquired 117 new relationships that brought 6 billion reais in net near money. In payments get net already operates in five countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the UK in 24. In Auto we continue to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. In January 23 we have expanded three of our OEM partnerships to new countries. Finally our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a 29 basis points improvement in efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a 125 million saves in this year. 55 from the recent deployment of gravity, 60 from the new global agreements with vendors and 9 million from the implementation of new IT and OBS shared services. Let's look at how one transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue proactive customer. Process automation is enabling us to spend less time in operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Since our investor day we have reduced the number of operational FTs per million customers by 5%. We are already deploying global platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale and spread best practices. We have implemented across the group proprietary backhand gravity already deployed in three countries and CIB. This is delivering 55 million inefficiencies in 23 and we have executed 75 billion transactions this year alone, that's 10% of the group's total. We're expanding our cards platform across a group, delivering real-time digital processing capability store banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around 100 million per year when it's fully deployed. Finally, we are being able to transfer the best in-class products and processes from the country of Oregon to the rest of the group, which lets to a strong value creation. The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear. In CIB we continue to grow strongly. Our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop-shop service to all our clients, capturing crozor their flows and making CIB products and services available to our wealth, retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa. As a result, revenue from these two concepts or negative revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to 3 billion. Wealth management and insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well-abop target, boosted by benefits of the Santander network effect. In private banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have 52 billion of assets on their management book tabo. That's 12% higher than a year ago. Our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market. Our payments have has become one of the largest processors of account-to-account payments in Europe. Spain, the UK and CIB are already processing a significant payment volume through Pagonext, while we execute full migration of all the groups 8 to 8 payments in the next 18 months. In Alto, we continue to prioritize profitability of our market share growth in a context of rising interest rates. Global auto revenue was affected by lower-list income in the US and the new regulation in Germany. One transformation is now being extended across a group and the increasing contribution from a global and a group of businesses are helping us to reach our 25 profitability targets across regions and businesses. Some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates and they should continue to do so in 24. As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of improvement. This is a clear competitive advantage that will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation. The group's Rote rose 126 basis points year-on-year to run 15% as mentioned before. Jose will go now in more detail to the group's performance. Thank you Jose. Thank you, Ektor and good morning everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail. Starting with revenue, there was strong growth driven by customer revenue again, this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. This was primarily supported by a retail business as we actively managed interest rate tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America. We delivered double digit growth across most businesses, in particular our network businesses which made up 38% of total revenue. The only exception was auto which was affected by lower listening income in the US. Revenue at the corporate center also improved by more than 500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII which continued its upward trend, increasing 7% in the quarter driven mostly by Europe and Mexico. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. Nine months 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in DCV North America and South America. In terms of profitability we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs thanks to our discipline, the positive remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion. In Europe we are strictly managing the positive costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, whether it's excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment but beat us remaining in line with our expectations. In South America the positive rates are more directly linked to market interest rates with results in negative sensitivity to raising rates. Therefore as interest rates are starting to decline we are seeing improved NII trends. In North America in the US beat us continue to increase, although in line with our expectations while net interest margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward in Europe we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in a constant in a context of stable interest rates or a slight increase which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of the positive growth at least in the first half of next year. At the same time as I said we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in South America. Turning to fees in an environment of low-fink and growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity our netfink and grew 9% compared to the third quarter of 22 and 6% year on year with good performance across regions and businesses. Retail banking grew well supported by a larger customer base and our tailored and targeted value propositions. Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees with corporate investment banking and Paganxed leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate investment banking is increasing its share of leading roles and Paganxed continued to expand its businesses increasing total payment volumes 24% year on year and transactions 32%. Wealth management and insurance was slightly up as customers moved to lower value added funds than bringing lower fees. However we saw increase activity in both private banking and Santanderas' management with three consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year on year driven by good performance in all our main markets. In terms of cost savings from one transformation initiatives which will become more evident in the coming quarters are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization. Group cost declined 0.5% real-terms and driving down the transaction cost per active the transactional cost per active customer 2% in real-terms as sector mentioned earlier. This in turn is reflected in efficiency gains laid by Europe which improved six percentage points with cost flat in real-terms. In North America and DCB cost increases likely in real-terms reflecting investments to accelerate transformation. Additionally cost was also slightly affected by some perimeter effects such as the incorporation of APS in the US and MCE bank acquisition and US delantes agreement in DCB. As a result group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expected to stay for the rest of the year. Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in use car prices in the US. The MPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than 1.2%. Spain continues to perform well with a 12-man cost of risk down nine basis points year-on-year supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. In other units such as the UK Portugal and the digital consumer bank the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expected to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Mexico is also increasing although it remains at comfortable levels mainly due to a change in mix towards and secure loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability. Normalization continues in the US in line with expectations. As we mentioned last quarter cost of risk in Brazil seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-man cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row and the MPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high rated customers. To close with our balance structure we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment product and country. Our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low loan to values, average loan to values. Loans decrease 2% year-on-year as a consequence of higher interest rates reducing credit demand and driving early repayments, especially evident in Europe and especially evident within European mortgages. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and the C.B. On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well at 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as the positive inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments. Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which has stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes. Mutual funds rose 11% with growth across all countries except the US following a year of instability in 2022. Our fully-doted capital ratio improved to 12.3%, but by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in a quarter, which included 33 basis points charged in shareholder remuneration. 21 related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual. We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a frontbook return on res-weighted assets of 2.7% up from 2.5% in the first nine months of 2022 equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of res-weighted assets with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our investor day target of 85 in 2025. Increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years. We are confident our fully-loaded capital ratio will remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel 3 in 2025 on a fully-loaded basis. That's all from my side, Ektor, over to you. Thank you. Thank you Jose. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with customer and double digit revenue growth supported by all region regions and businesses. We are accelerating one transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth. We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CETI-1, while credit quality remains strong in line with our expectations. All of these contributes to double digit growth in shareholder value creation and increased remuneration. We remain on track to meet our 23 targets. The execution for strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability. We see further upside potential for NII growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rates hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South America. Efficiency, or ready at the lower range of our 23 target, is expected to keep improving or revenue cost as we increasingly realize one transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target and we expect it to remain at similar levels in 24. At our investor day, we set a rotted target of 15 to 17%. We expect to reach a rote above 15% by the year end and continue to improve significantly during 24. And we see our fully loaded CET-1 clearly above a 12% target even after the implementation of ASL-3 in January 25. As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double digit shareholder value creation through the cycle further supported by our last step towards the full implementation of one standard which will enable us to fully capture our in market and global value. And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions. Thank you, Hector. We're ready to start the Q&A session. Can we have the first question please? If you wish to ask the question, please press star 500 telephone. We already have the first question from Francisco Rical from Alan Trague. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I want to focus on long growth. In Spain has been particularly weak, it's down 10% year and year, the sector is minus 3. I see that most of the fall is related to CIV, which is down over 20%, but SME and Morgan Villes are also weak if you can comment the gap with the sector. We know demand is weak, but below the sector. More broader in other regions, I mean, longs in the UK are also down 5%, the sector is up 1, Brazil is up by just 3%. The sector is growing 9%, so you can elaborate on whether you are feiorityizing margins over volumes. If you are more prudent on risk taking up this point in the cycle, so long growth in general and in Spain in particular. Thank you. Thank you Francisco. Yes, basically, as you have said, long growth has not been good in the old year, I would say. Spain mainly, as you basically say, is also being affected by prepayments in some of the mortgages. If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen, I mean, normally, basically, we go down 3.5, this basically we have had prepayments up to 6.5 billion so far this year. You write SME and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and the man continues to be strong, this is a fact and we have seen the clients basically being cautious. Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America, is continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability. So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way. And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year and we continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear bill of what's going on. I believe that credit will come back. Little by little. I don't know if you would like just one. One final comment. Resuaded assets are down to billion in the quarter, but it's exclusively due to effects. So if we look, if we exclude effects impact on resuaded assets, resuaded assets are actually flat in the quarter, which is what, you know, matter most for profitability and capital. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. I'm Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the profitability outlook and the second one on us acquiring the US. So starting with the first one, you've right away to your guidance for the Fulia, which, if a mom is taken implies, an app profit around 10.9 billion euros for this year. Can you confirm that? And how do you see profitability in 2024? It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the US. My second question is respect to our equality in the US. There was a big uptick this quarter and you've been talking about normalization and cost of risk. And I will see lower use car prices and higher the link, but neither of them were material changes. So a question is what's driving this? Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing specifically on us, equality, and related to that. I see you've confirmed your 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do you expect this number to look like next year? Thank you. Yes, thank you, Antonio. Okay, on profitability, as I say during the presentation, I rate the rate, the 15% rotting, so that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for. Okay, so in that sense, we'll pretty comfortable on that. On 24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing, so we see an strong first half of the year in Europe, and then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamic changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better. Okay, so in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that. In terms of asset quality in the US, and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look of what happened last year in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that and we told you so. And what is important to tell you that is actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points as you correctly appoint. In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day the link-wancies or above when it's used to happen is we use to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better and we are repossessing between 60 and 65% of those. If the trade continues like that and a use car prices in the US continue like that, we expect better performance that we normally expect. It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio. But that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain a good levels. And also the US has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamics as well. So in that sense I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you. Jose, please would like to compliment on the profitability? Yeah, just one final comment on US As a Quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85 and given the changes in the mix that Ektor mentioned, we don't expect to reach those levels at all and we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly apt compared to 2023 in the US. In terms of profitability, we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So rates start going down. We will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil in particular, coupled with higher long growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly the profitability in South America sector mentioned is going to gain momentum throughout the year, which with a much better second half relative to the first half. And in Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprise on the asset side. There's one example. In Spain we have around 80 billion of mortgages. You know that they reprise around 12 every month. Well, in fact, we reprise 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of 24, we will still reprise a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to reprising. So asset reprising, particularly in Spain, and obviously some beta pressures and the cost of deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we actually, you know, we remain constructive on profitability and profitability improving actually in 24 relative to 23. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Sophie Peterson for JP Morgan, please go ahead. Yeah, hi. Here is the feedback from JP Morgan. Just to develop on the previous question. So could you just remind us what the current deposit beta in Spain is? And I got a part with Moved in the quarter and also how you see the deposit beta moving in the other geographies, mainly UK, US, and I guess also Portugal. So that would be my first question. And then the second question would be around the US tax rate. It was very low this quarter. How should we think about the US tax rate going forward and what kind of normalised run rate? And then if I may, just if you get comments on any capital headlines going forward, thank you. Thank you Sophie. And if you're on to use, plainly, I'll be the second question because we couldn't hear you well. First of all, on deposit bitters, I mean bitters today's in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had. And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally. And we expect pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase. I mean, it's normal because of the dynamics of what's going on. And the geographies we are present are showing a different behaviour. Our CO4 now give you a little bit further details on that. Yeah, Sophie, in Spain, total beta is slightly over 20%, 22%. But if we exclude corporate investment banking, corporate investment banking is already almost fully priced. X corporate investment banking is 13%. Remember that we have 153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes. So and the beta there is almost zero. We don't expect any significant change in the behaviour in the market in the coming quarter. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year. In the UK, beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that, it's around 50%. So here we would expect higher, gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in the UK today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland 30%, and in the US is 32%. XCV, X corporate investment banking is 31%. Very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that. So bottom line is we would expect cost of the process to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly in Spain, also in the UK, etc. So in terms of the tax rate in the US going forward, what I could tell you and we could basically contact you to give you more detail, I believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles and that basically helps us in the tax rate that we have outstanding today. But to give you details, we later could call you and give you exactly what's going on there. Your final question, capital head. The only one is the only significant capital head we have is the final implementation of Basel III. Still some detail rulings or regulations need to be written, but bottom line is the total fully loaded impact would be around 50 or 55 basis points. The facing impact, so the charge on January 1st, 25, is going to be between 15 to 20 basis points. So again, very much in line with previous expectations, maybe it's better than what we expected. Thank you, Sophie. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Ignacio Larghi from BNP Pariva, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I just have a thanks for taking my question time for the presentation. I have just two questions. The first one on Brazil, after the performance that we have seen this quarter, where that has been growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we suspect better, moment in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk appetite? So we see an acceleration of growth also due to mixed changes as we are seeing in Mexico. And what should be a spec for 2024 from Brazil? And also, if you could say a bit of color on what has been the driver of course growth in Spain in the quarter and whether we suspect some synergies coming from one to another in coming quarters in Spain or or it's more restricted to Mexico and the US. Thank you. Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been seeing is as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix. Okay? So you're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out. First of all, because our some of them, the positions that we took actually the credit loans that we gave, basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out. Because remember that the mix that we changed went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans and the mix has also changed and is getting better. We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs. So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean, we're open to a little bit more of giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well. But our credit appetite is cautious nevertheless. And we expect Brazil, basically, to perform really well in that sense. Okay? So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we manage in the portfolio. And second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe is going to be much better. In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we are being implementing one transformation. Okay? So with implementation of one transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit some processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the banking that sense. But as you're going to see, a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact, because we are, as you know, we are simplification, we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have. We are doing also automation of many different things. And we are pushing our branches, basically, to move more toward businesses than look at the incidence of problems. So all that transformation that we're making in the, in all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more. But it's going to be in control. And we expect that to continue drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that. Okay? So in terms of, in Brazil going back to just to that, just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of 24. Okay? As we continue to go on and we'll be lob the portfolio is going to be performing much better. Okay? I don't know Jose, if you would like to complement? As I said, I think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum. So we have already started to see a slight change. Rates have dropped just a hundred basis points to from 1375 to 1275. We expect another 100 basis point drop in the third quarter. Sorry, in the fourth quarter. But we would expect probably 200 to 250 drop next year. So this accumulates. So when we look at year-on-year, third quarter, fourth quarter, we would see rates probably 400 basis points down. So clearly the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Alvaro Serrano for Moro Young Stanley. Please go ahead. Next question and we'll recapture Alvaro later on. Thank you. Thank you. The next question from San Pedro from CD. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on restructuring charges. So understand your profitability target is underlying. Should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your new reporting structure? The second question is your outlook on operating expenses in the US. You've gone on a hiring of investment bankers recently. So what is the outlook for cost and how much revenue do you expect to generate as a result? And just quickly on your effective tax rating, Brazil for 2024, and what is your expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital? Thank you. Thank you, Marta. No, we don't expect any restructuring charges at all or because of the restructuring that we just did in the organization. The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. Okay, this is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what one transformation means, which means exactly simplifying first of all, okay, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly, okay. Second, basically, automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, okay, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a good, really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client. In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain, it's 50% of that. So basically, this is what one transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, MhR acquiring that has been deployed already, mostly Latin America, you see the cost coming down, and you see also that we're getting revenue on quota from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand where one transformation is, and why are we doing this? Second, in terms of, you said one question, what's on operating expenses in the US? Very important question. What we're doing in the US is just a complement of the rest of our CIV business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIV, I mean large for the standards of Latin America, and a very important player also in CIV in Europe. It's important to point out that 94% of our business that we do there is client oriented. It's very important to understand that. It's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, it's selling effects, it's selling plain vanilla derivatives, it's doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients, Admitzize and SME clients. This is basically the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the US. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIV in the US. This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in four or five particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe in the US, which by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing. This is a size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator. You're going to see that revenue is going to start to pick up in CIV pretty fast given that because it's already a complement as I was saying of the rest of the business. Tax rate in Brazil next year, Eurasian, sorry, taxes on on capital, that's been proposed and discussed is not approved and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed. The finance minister believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that because the main reason for that is to tax companies that are not paying taxes. The banks are paying already lots of taxes. So I think we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take, but by no means is a done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented. Thank you, Marta. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for the presentation. From a side, a quick question on revenue performance, we will explain how NIR has been the key driver of revenue momentum. However, going back to the capital market day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be on the performing a little bit or initial expectation. Could you elaborate on that? Is that the market momentum as weekend, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that you are running behind your initial plan? And second, when you talk about the cost of resuscitationality in the US, could you explain a little bit better why is that? And why there is such a concentration in traditions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand. And lastly, on reporting changes, I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the regional commercial and new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional PNL and balance sheets for each subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail? Thank you very much. Thank you Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market. No, if you see the fees, for example, in the first nine months, we grew 6% year-on-year, okay? It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, no? Mainly CIV and payments, okay? It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income, okay? And by 25, that would increase from 42 to 50%. So basically, according to our plan, okay? It's important also that risk-capitite increase is changing the portfolio mix, okay? And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out, okay? And we see also, and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue exactly what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIV that is basically up 15% year-on-year. Pagonex is a payment side and merchant acquiring is up to 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, you know? Because exactly what's happening in the market? The auto business is generating 5% more across the board, okay? You see very good performance in Mexico and the US and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have, okay? So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to start into come up also helping out by what's the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly, okay? So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well and also as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the field revenue. That's basically what has been one of the laggers, the field revenue, okay? The seasonality in the US is has always been like that. I mean, that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marketing the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, etc. The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the US and also that people basically don't want to refine other cars or don't see the availability of loans and cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out and that's why you see better numbers and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today and was expected to continue, okay? And also the change of mix is getting us out, okay? So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind. In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment, okay? So you will continue to have that information. I don't know, Jose, if I left anything out? No, no, no, I think we will report as we manage the bank, so we will report these horizontal businesses as the primary segments obviously, but we will continue sector-set providing all the information from a country level upwards, so you will be able to see the country's performance organized by these businesses and the global performance organized by countries, so you will be able to have both views at the same time. Thank you Carlos. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Alba Rosarano from Morgan Stanley. Hi, sorry for earlier. A couple of questions, one is really a follow-up and thanks very much for your steer on provisions for 2024. If I can sort of take advantage of, you open that door, in the context of what we've seen in the US, within flat provision, what direction or a bit of color, how could we expect the US evolve in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 6065. It was 58, I think you put the number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings, and now you have student loans picking up. Is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024, or do you think it could take more time to just understand how you're thinking about the US within that flat group context? And the second, hopefully easier one, is on the UK, you've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the UK as a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there specifically for UK, given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough comedy, on deposits you had your own offering out in September, so maybe you got more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Alberto. Actually, I was expecting your question on the US, so let me give you exactly what is the important, different dynamic that car has to student loans and different things. The car in the US is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe as in Latin America, actually people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage, and then the auto loan, etc. In the US is the other way around. The US, if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean, you're completely isolated. So the behavior of the auto loans in the US is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. That's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. That's exactly why the behavior of the link when it's basically coming from in that way. Normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60 to 62, 63 percent maybe going up. Let's see how the US evolves and if we have a soft landing or not that will only depend on that. Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio as we have set already. That's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in-prime and in-ear-prime. Even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk and the way. But we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio and also we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, etc. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that and very cautious on the way we manage in cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly. And then on the UK, the UK, as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of one transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there leading to probably and the UK is leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming it and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the UK with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities. NIAI has grown year on year 9.3. I was driven by higher rates as you know and we have a really strong focus on managing spreads and profitability. So you see that we have been lowering the portfolio that because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean we are as the rest of the market at 2.2. But we are offsetting the increased cost of retail funding and slowdown of new year regulations by basically playing in that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities. It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability of head of market share. Okay. And we have lower risk appetite as I told you. And we believe that we could have an immense pension by doing that. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Andrea Filtre from MedioBanca. Please go ahead. Yes. Good morning. First question on if you can remind us of the Brazilian interest rate sensitivity. Second question is follow up on several questions from colleagues. If you can actually give us a concrete indication of the structural tax rate in Brazil and in the US in light of the new electric vehicles leading that you're doing. Is this a structural move or is just a one-off that we've seen? Then on capital, given that you are confirming your 15 to 17% target with a 15% for this year, should we not see also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate? And finally, digital euro. What do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation have you budgeted the impact to your business model and can you share it with us? Thank you. Thank you Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro and then Jose will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital. First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and is a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated that discussions should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June 24. And they're saying that instead they were examining and in a quiet and slow way by the new Commission and the new Parliament. So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense. In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized the investigation phase of the digital euro, as they said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a two-year preparation phase as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will evolve finalizing in the rulebook and the selection selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important and this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen. And as a decision on the digital euro, I don't believe we'll not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't spec to release before 2016. On this context, I mean, us as Van Gogh Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the digital euro. Also developed the Pan-European integrated payments market is basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe and also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and the implementation phase. Okay. So that's a way we see it at this point. With this, I will basically pass it to Jos\\u00e9 to tell you. Hello Andrea. Brazil's interest rate sensitivity is 150 million euros to a drop of 100 basis points or things been equal. Tax rate, in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the US. And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation. We don't expect any significant regulatory charges or the other than the ones we mentioned and obviously always subject to available for sale, impacts, etc. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital build up. So you're right. I mean, the higher the higher the profitability, the better. We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk weighted assets across the group. In the first nine months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around 15 to 18 billion in risk weighted assets. We think we can do more or less 30 billion or close to 30 billion, 25 to 30 this year. And that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet. So on our balance sheet. So the focus going forward is going to be the optimizing risk weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So you're right that we would expect the capital build up to accelerate in the coming quarters. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Pablo de la Torre quebas, from RBC. Please go ahead. Hi and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on credit cards in Brazil. Could you please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country? And if possible, could you please give us any indication of the contribution to Brazilian NII of these types of lending? And any estimate that you can give us on the potential penalty impact of the new measures announced? I guess besides the negative impact to NII, are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality? And are there any offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pablo. Hoso will tell you basically about the situation in Brazil. Again, these are ongoing negotiations. I just already referred to Interstone Capital. Here again, the focus is more on corporates than financials. Obviously, there might be an effect on banks, but that's not the main focus. But in our case, it would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as it has been proposed. But again, we think that will change credit cards. The 90-day period for self-regulation is already counting and is finalizing by year end. We do not expect an agreement here. So probably by sending the Bankers Association in Brazil, sorry, the central bank in Brazil will have to regulate. There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a modeling which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principle, which is called the UK model. Again, Sandandair and Febra Banda, the Bankers Association, are already working with the central bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on Nenai, but there might be ways of offsetting this through commission income, etc. Because there is a lot of significant rotation of the balances in Brazil. So again, working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes. Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Next question from Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank, BPI, please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good morning, Carlos Peixoto from Cascha Bank. A couple of questions from my side as well in a few minutes. So on NNII, a minor detail, but in my majority, but in Portugal you have a 40% quarter and quarter in Greece. In NNII, this quarter, I see the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the previous quarter. You do have an increase in the alcohol portfolio, but in any case, I was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution and also what should we expect in coming quarters. Then on the UK and NNII as well, I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect, I feel at previously, or you were wondering about a high single digit increase in NNI in the UK for this year, you expect that to be the case still and how do you see it evolving into next year. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you Carlos. NNII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal, no. It's been helping us out basically because of the reprising of the portfolio, the rates we're going. I believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe, so that will help out and then we'll stabilize. That's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time and we don't see more growth in that sense. NNII should stabilize in Portugal. In terms of the UK, I explained quite well exactly what's going on. If I made before you go. Just to give some more color on Portugal. When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3 in the first quarter, 4 in the second, 4.6 in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14, 26, 38, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days. All of this may explain the differences. But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent. I would expect, as Ektor said, obviously, there is a limit to the reprising of assets. Mortgage is in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the six-month Uriber, not the 12-month Uriber in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of the post-us in Portugal is really, really low and we don't see any competition there. So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. Thank you, Jose. Very quickly on the UK carlos. As I said, basically, we continue to put profitability ahead of market share. We have lower risk appetite given the dynamics on that market. And we combined that and we would like to combine that with the wood performance with that basically could lead to an immense pension. But answering your question, I expect in 2023 with a high single digit growth and on high rates management of the deposit cost, well, we assume the lower volumes that we have. And that's basically the outlook that we have for the UK at this point. I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to compliment what I think with that, I answer your question. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Blita Smith from autonomous. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one will be on the NRI in Spain. The customer spread widened and you've also increased the alcohol portfolio, but the NIMO is flat. So maybe you can explain what's happened there and also give us an update on the alcohol portfolio. And the second one will be on Chile. We've seen a big decline in NRI here. I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year. But what do you think is the outlook there for this year and also when will the NRI improve in 2024? Thanks. Thank you, Blita. I will start basically, give you the overall view and then Jose can give you a little bit more of details on both. I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most from the higher rates. And we continue to see, as I said, a strong growth from clients. We have a 651,000 new customers, net new customers in the last 12 months. We see also a strong contribution from the global businesses. Wealth management is increasing 84% year-in-year. CIV 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And CIV is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that. We expect double digit NRI growth in 23. Okay. And in terms, we see very factors to consider. We see as Jose explained you in detail assets reprising at least during the first half of 24. Okay. Clients continue to grow and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no minimum, no meaningful deposit moments in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. The deposit basis is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of 20,000 euros, which basically contributes to the stability. Also, it's very important to take into account that the one transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well. And we're very focused on the product simplification, as I said, where we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. Okay. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to have. Exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. Yeah. Rita, let me tell you, Elon loans. This is the same explanation that we have of Portugal. In quarter and quarter, it basically has to do with many, many, probably many small things. But when you look at Elon, Elon loans in Spain, from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5, first quarter, 3.3, second quarter, 3.8, fourth quarter, 4.3. So very much, almost an Australian line increase. And in the case of the deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53, 72, 19, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat. So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprise up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages is 77 billion and around 60% reprise is in the first half. So I think the Elon loans will continue although the rates interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe might stay flat. The reprise in of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year. And in terms of the pressure on the cost of the deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already reprised. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. So to what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits. And we think that is a limited amount. So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of the deposits. In Chile, we have two balance sheets. So two sensitivities to the balance sheet one is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So we see an IIM Brazil actually expanding, again, gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantial in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year. Because again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the UF and rates. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Hugo Cruz from KBW, please go ahead. I think for the time you go from KBW, just a couple of questions. Mexico and I, the growth of Q&A will be quite strong. I guess I'm not going to ask you why it's been stronger than expected by one. If you could give guidance for the full year, what kind of an agro to you expecting years? And then finally on Argentina, quite volatile, and we have elections soon. So I was wondering if you can give what to expect or impact from the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. Thank you. Thank you. Mexico, as you have seen, has been a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and on secure loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before. So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio. So it's quite important to see that. We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months. And I believe it's going to grow strongly also on 24. The important thing to understand is actually how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the US. Both I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on 24 and continue to have very good growth on NIA. Okay, in terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really, and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks at may things stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the, in the exchange rate, between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the, in the black market. So in that sense, let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult tasks they have in front. Now, the just one final comment here, the way we've managed Argentina is to have, we're trying to hedge, obviously, against inflation, and hedging our investment against inflation. And that will continue to be the key element. Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and unofficial exchange rates. We are aware of that. We are aware of the impact that a devaluation could have on our books. So we are managing that to minimize the impact if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our investment in Brazil, but basically by managing and investing inflation risk. Thank you very much. Can we have the next question, please? Next question from Fernando Gil de Santibanes from West Inverte, please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Thank you, please. First of all, I'm Peter Puchino-Bank. I see the current possible focus 11% still have reached off from the target, but 15%. Then you have for the ban, can you please comment the outlook for 2024? Please, this is the first one. The second would be about the alcohol portfolio. I see an increase in about 10 billion in the quoted. Can you please request strategy? Can the level of unrealized loss of e-calflux portfolio and highly unfolded? If you can please comment on the outlook for the extension on the mortgage holidays, please. Thank you very much. So let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We are going to have a new government and this will have to go to parliament. So very early stages of this proposal and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal if any will be conducted because again this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government. The Alcozory also briefed us about this and I forgot. We have more or less 27, almost 30 billion of alcohol in Spain at an average yield of around 3. 4%. We expect to end the year at around 30 billion. We might increase the alcohol a little bit more next year, obviously taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of the process or against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability but obviously this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year. Yes, on this C.B. There has been a particular change in the business in this year. In this C.B. in particular, there is one very important. We had a really good growth in terms of loans but the majority of those loans at the vast majority is basically stock financing. Okay, giving the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months. First of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now the basically we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start that the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. Okay, so that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve. It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale and also you're going to see a dynamic or what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans directly to individuals. Okay, so we believe that the outlook would be good. It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. One final comment here, although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously the higher the rates the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because of the way we do not have sensitivity to that movement. Obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that one point I wanted to make. The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitization, etc. So a range is to try to minimize that like Ektor was saying by managing the assets that we have on our books. Thank you. Can we have the last question please? Last question from Ignacio Ferrezo from UBS, please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I've got the F3 followers. The first one is on the NIA in Brazil. I mean, I used to stick into the guidance you gave in Q2, that Q4 would be better than Q3. And if you can give a little bit of color in terms of the pattern of NIA expansion next year, QB is expecting like a linear increase through the year. You're going to have some degree of seasonality at some point. The second one is on the US. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but one has driven the 13 percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the unit. And the third one is on capital return, giving you comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of a positive or do you see any chances of stopping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in 24. Thank you. Thank you. Look Ignacio, in terms of NIA in Brazil, I think it's important. I mean, we rate the rate first of all, as I have seen the worst of the NIA is behind us. We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NIA in the coming quarters. Okay. Rates as Hoss explained to you have started to curve down. I mean, 100 basis points in the Q323. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 1175. So that's basically tells you, we're flattening the Q2. The clinging rates proscrate activity increasing plus market related NIA no longer a drag. NIA improvements. So that basically tells you that we, yes, we believe that the second, sorry, that the four quarters is going to be better than the third. Okay. In terms of what do we see in the future, it's exactly as Hoss explained you is that we see a trend going upwards towards more towards the second half of the year next year. Okay. And that's the way we see it is going to help out if rates continue to come down and Bolleux continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point. All right. In terms of the US coverage, okay. It's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed, okay. And we have an update in long to values include the current value of the cars, okay. And in addition of the quarters, we have CRE charges due to the angry rating of several companies in the sector and in FinTech charges due to origination in that sense, but I see that this would normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said, okay. So in that sense, I don't see a problem that is also there was an increasing provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with a GST remediation, but other than that, I think it's quite what it was quite normal. Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77, okay. And it's below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is about the total all portfolio is flat year and year, 2.7. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital we turn, please Jose. No, I think that's for the board to decide. So for this year, the policy has been decided and that's for the board to decide, obviously. Thank you. I believe we have no questions. So thank you very much, everybody, for your time. As always, the Investor Relations team remains at your disposal for any and all questions that you may have. Thank you.
