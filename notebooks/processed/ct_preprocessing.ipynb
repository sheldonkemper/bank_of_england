No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about \\u2013 it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.\",\n          \"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting \\u2013 continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that's sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf\",\n          \"jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"3Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-10-11\",\n          \"2023-10-13\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about \\u2013 it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.\",\n          \"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting \\u2013 continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that's sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf\",\n          \"jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"3Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-10-11\",\n          \"2023-10-13\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleaned_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_tokenised_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleaned_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone.

These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights. Firmwide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealth Management business. we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic \\u2013 revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in Card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex. Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12%, driven by higher Firmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC's special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $816 (sic) million, predominately driven by Card. On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre-pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs which were up $825 million year-on-year, predominately due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card, largely offset by a release in Home Lending. 3 Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8K with historical results including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the re-organization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions, with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and Commodities compared to a strong prior-year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year- on-year, driven by higher non-interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year, with increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year and client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on page 9. We now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. 4 Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income; we're just mentioning this to help with your models. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase Thank you, and good morning, everyone. the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. we have more on our fourth-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion or 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in Card and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. you can see the reported results for the full year. I'll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and Securities Services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues. Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolve growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card. The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% year-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges. 2 Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as continued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes in Cash. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology and legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And Commercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year. And we had client asset net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a net loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth. We expect healthy Card loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business driven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure. And as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios. 3 Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"jpmc-third-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf\",\n          \"jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"financial_quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3Q24\",\n          \"3Q23\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-10-11\",\n          \"2023-10-13\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
