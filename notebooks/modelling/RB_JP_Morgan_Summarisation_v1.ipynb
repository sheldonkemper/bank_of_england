So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['yeah sure let summarize drivers change outlook primary driver really lower deposit rate paid expectations across consumer wholesale which mentioned driven couple factors so change rate environment cuts coming sooner outlook else equal take pressure reprice said were getting lot positive feedback field product offerings short-term cd particular really getting lot positive feedback folks branches attractive yield-seeking customers thats kind working well asset side seeing little bit higher card revolve helping ill remind conference february suggested already starting feel like uncertainties mentioned giving guidance started moving direction one things contributed upward revision like uncertainty kind went way jamies pointed \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c uncertainties still there highlight page look forward year next year medium-term remain focused those']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['yeah sure let summarize drivers change outlook primary driver really lower deposit rate paid expectations across consumer wholesale which mentioned driven couple factors so change rate environment cuts coming sooner outlook else equal take pressure reprice said were getting lot positive feedback field product offerings short-term cd particular really getting lot positive feedback folks branches attractive yield-seeking customers thats kind working well asset side seeing little bit higher card revolve helping ill remind conference february suggested already starting feel like uncertainties mentioned giving guidance started moving direction one things contributed upward revision like uncertainty kind went way jamies pointed \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c uncertainties still there highlight page look forward year next year medium-term remain focused those']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive Role\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CFO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Q&A\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go to the live presentation Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Offic er, Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning everyone The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the b ack Starting \\non page 1, the firm reported net income of $93 billion, EPS of $304 on revenue of $399 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15% These \\nresults included the $29 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate  \\n \\nOn page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results Simi lar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where \\nrelevant You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate line s of business For \\nthe quarter, First Republic contrib uted $19 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income  \\n \\nNow focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $381 billion was up $25 billion or  7% year -on-year \\nNII ex Markets was up $2 2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates NIR ex Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets \\nrevenue was up $141 million or 2% Expenses of $236 billion were up $46 billion or 24% year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC \\nspecial a ssessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology  \\n \\nAnd credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $22 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million Net charge -offs were up $13 \\nbillion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved The net re serve build \\nwas primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuat ions in the Commercial \\nBank  \\n \\nLooking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $1623 and revenue of $162 bi llion And we \\ndelivered an ROTCE of 21% On to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quar ter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points \\nversus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pac e of capital \\ndistributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endga me requirements  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5 Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year -on-year, driven by strong \\naccount growth, and consumer spend remained stable Turning now to the financial results excluding Fir st Republic, CCB reported net income \\nof $44 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nIn Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year -on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with \\naverage balances down 8% year -on-year Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c in \\nfact, it's been a record year for retail net new money In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by  the absence of \\nan MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower Auto lease income C ard outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve \\nAnd in Auto, originations were $99 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins  \\n \\nExpenses of $87 billion were up 10% yea r-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, \\nadvisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology In terms of credit  performance \\nthis quarter, cre dit costs were $22 billion, largely driven by net charge -offs, which were up $791 million year -on-year, predominantly due to \\ncontinued normalization in Card The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 6 Th e CIB reported net income of $25 billion on revenue of $11 billion Investment Banking revenue of $16 billion was \\nup 13% year -on-year IB fees were also up 13% year -on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 88% In \\nAdvisory,  fees were up 2% Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior -year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up \\n30%  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nWe are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but anno unced M&A remains a \\nheadwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain Payments revenue was $23 billion, up 10% \\nyear-on-year Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit -related client credits  \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $58 billion, up 2% year -on-year Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8% It was another \\nstrong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lo wer revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year \\nEquity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash Securities Services revenue of $12 billion was up 3% year -\\non-year Expenses of $68 billion were up 4% year -on-year, p redominantly driven by the timing of revenue -related compensation Credit costs \\nwere $210 million, reflecting net charge -offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 7 Commercial Banking reported net income of $15 billion Revenue of $37 billion was up 7% year -\\non-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances Payments revenu e of $2 billion, \\nwas up 2% year -on-year, driven by fee growth, la rgely offset by deposit -related client credits Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue \\nof $924 million, was up 32% year -on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity  \\n \\nExpenses of $14 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as \\nwell as higher volume -related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition Average deposits were down 6% year -on-year, primarily \\ndriven by l ower non -operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter -on-quarter as client balances \\nare seasonally higher at year -end \\n \\nLoans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revo lver utilization and muted demand for new loans as \\nclients remain cautious And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff acti vity Finally, \\ncredit costs were $269 million, including net charge -offs of $127  million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our \\ncommercial real estate valuation outlook  \\n \\nAnd then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c with p re-tax \\nmargin of 28% Revenue of $47 billion was up 2% year -on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average \\nmarket levels, predominantly offset by lower NII The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balance s, partially offset by wider \\nspreads on loans  \\n \\nExpenses of $34 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance -based incentives; \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J P Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the \\ncontinued investment in Global Shares  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $12 billion \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c positive across Equities and Fixed Income \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c and $140 billion for the full year In \\nliquidity, we saw net  inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year And we had record client asset net \\ninflows $489 billion for the year AUM of $34 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 9 Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million Revenue of $18 billion was up $597  million year -on-year NII of \\n$25 billion, was up $12 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix NIR was a net loss of $687 million, \\ncompared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities lo sses I mentioned upfront And expenses of $34 billion \\nwere up $3 billion year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment  \\n \\nWith that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10 We expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be  approximately $88 billion \\nGoing through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this ye ar On deposits, we \\nexpect balances to be very modestly down from current levels While lower rates sho uld decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset \\nsensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins We expect strong loan grow th in Card to \\ncontinue, but not at the same pace as 2023 Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates Outside of Card, loan growth will \\nlikely remain muted  \\n \\nIt's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex Markets run rate of $94 billion Combining that with the ful l year guidance of \\napproximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for \\nsome time And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII out look r emain \\nAnd on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which , as always, you \\nshould think of as largely offset in NIR  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to expenses on page 11 We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion You'll see on the slide, we provided detail \\nby line of business Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the \\ngreatest opportunities are, both in terms  of share and available returns And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and \\nthen  \\n \\n4\\n \\n \\nOn the right -hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call busines s \\ngrowth wr it large Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue -related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the \\ncompany as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023 But in addition, the ongoing growth of  the company, \\nwhich continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categ ories  \\n \\nThe quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, \\ntechnology, as well as marketing Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lo wer 2024 exit run \\nrate as the result of business integration efforts Finally, despite significantly l ower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see \\nsome residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories  \\n \\nIt's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have be en executed both in response to \\nmarket conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company We've included the fourth qu arter 2023 exit \\nrate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year -on-year incre ase in expense is already in the run rate  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 35%, \\nconsistent with Investor Day guidance So, in closing, we shouldn't le ave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing \\nrecord revenue and net income despite some notable significant items We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank \\neveryone who made it possible At the same time, w e emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over -earning, as indicated by \\nan ROTCE that is 4% above our through -the-cycle target  \\n \\nAs we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns \\nBut, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncerta inties, we remain \\noptimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a bro ad range of environments, and this management team \\nremains laser -focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies  and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on \\nJPMorgan Chase's web site, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please standby  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum Mr Barnum, pleas e go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $181 billion, EPS of $612 on rev enue of $51 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 28% These results included the $ 79 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation \\ncontribution of the appreciated Visa stock Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate E xcluding these \\nitems, the Firm had net income of $131 bi llion, EPS of $440, and an ROTCE of 20%  \\n \\nTouching on a couple of highlights In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year -on-year and 17% quarter -on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up \\n10% year -on-year In CCB, we had a record number of first -time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and \\nCard, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM  \\n \\nNow, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling o ut the First \\nRepublic contribution in the presentation Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in  the year -on-year \\ncomparison As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior -year quarter  only has two months of First Republic \\nresults compared to the full three months this quarter Also, in the prior -year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now \\nthey are primarily in the relevant line of business  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2  for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $86 billion or 20% year -on-year Excluding both \\nthe Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $27 billion, revenue of $431 b illion was \\nup $34 billion or 9% NII ex Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates,  higher revolving \\nbalances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic -related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit \\nbalances  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $73 billion or 56% Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $21 billion or 21%, largely driv en by higher \\nInvestment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees Both periods inc luded net investment securities losses And Markets revenue was \\nup $731 million or 10% year -on-year Expenses of $237 billion were up $29 billion or 14% year -on-year Excluding the Foundation \\ncontribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, prim arily driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees And credit costs were $31 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $22 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million Net \\ncharge -offs were up $820 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and \\n$189 million in Wholesale  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, up 30 basis points versus the pri or quarter, \\nprimarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA As you know, we completed CCAR a coup le of weeks \\nago and have already disclosed a number of the key points Let me summarize them again here Our preliminary SC B is 33%, although the \\nfinal SCB could be higher The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 29%, results in a 123% standard ized CET1 ratio \\nrequirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 And finally, the Firm an nounced that the board intends to increase the \\nquarterly common stock dividend from $115 to $125 per share in the third quarter of 2024  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $42 billion on revenue of $177 billion, which was \\nup 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year -on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin \\ncompression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter -on-\\nquarter Client investment assets were up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by market performance In Home Lending, revenue of $13 \\nbillion was up 31% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one addit ional month of the First Republic portfolio  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances \\nCard outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the co ntinued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were \\n$108 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins Expense s of $94 billion \\nwere up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven b y First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as \\nwell as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing  \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecti ng net charge -offs of $21 billion, up $813 million year -on-year, \\npredominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues The net reserve build was $579 mil lion, also \\ndriven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certa in macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $59 billion on  revenue \\nof $179 billion You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client \\ncoverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise This  quarter, IB fees \\nwere up 50% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 95% In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven \\nby the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior -year quarter Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up \\n51%, benefiting from favorable market conditio ns \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year -on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter We remain cautiously optimistic \\nabout the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect It's also worth noting that pull -forward refinancing activity was a \\nmeaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year  \\n \\nPayments revenue was $45 billion, down 4% year -on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit -related client credits were \\nlargel y offset by fee growth Moving to Markets, total revenue was $78 billion, up 10% year -on-year Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued \\nstrength in Securitized Products And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record \\nrevenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels Security Services revenue of $13 billio n was up 3% \\nyear-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compressio n Expenses of $92 billion were up \\n12% year -on-year, largely driven by higher revenue -related compensation, legal expense, and volume -related non -compensation expense  \\n \\nIn Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year -on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially \\nDemand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic \\nenvironment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre -pandemic levels Also, capital markets are open and are providing an \\nalternative to traditional bank lending for these clients In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination an d pay -off activity \\nAverage client deposits were up 2% year -on-year and relativ ely flat sequentially Finally, credit costs were $384 million The net reserve build \\nof $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach Net charge -offs were $164 \\nmillion, of which about half was in Office  \\n \\nThen, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $13 billion, with p re-tax \\nmargin of 32% Revenue of $53 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and \\nstrong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression Expenses of $35 bill ion were up 12% \\nyear-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue -related compensation and continue d growth in our private banking \\nadvisor teams For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of \\n$16 billion AUM of $37 trillion was up 15% year -on-year, and client assets o f $54 trillion were up 18% year -on-year, driven by higher market \\nlevels and continued net inflows And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $68 billion on revenue  of $101 billion Excluding this quarter's Visa -related \\ngain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year -on-year NII was up $626 \\nmillion year -on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mi x and higher rates Expenses of $16 billion were up $427 million year -on-year \\nExcluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year -on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic -related \\nexpense out of Corporate into the relevant  segments  \\n \\nTo finish up, we have the outlook on page 8 Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at In vestor Day \\nWe continue to expect NII and NII ex Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net \\ncharge -off rate of approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net incom e, or more \\nimportantly, after excluding the significant it ems, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong And, as always, we remain focused \\non continuing to execute with discipline  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's
