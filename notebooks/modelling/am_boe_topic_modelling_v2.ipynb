Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking \\u2013 are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?Okay.

So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look \\u2013 meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day.

Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking \\u2013 are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?Okay.

So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look \\u2013 meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day.

so, I think our strategy is now focused on regaining clients who left due to fears of instability.\\\"\\n   - **Explanation:** This demonstrates the forward-looking strategic direction aimed at regaining lost clients and managing future asset outflows, reflecting on broader strategic ambitions and growth planning.\\n\\n5. **Topic Name: Unified Approach Post Merger**\\n   - **Example Sentence:** \\\"So now, after the merger, the issue is no longer Credit Suisse versus UBS; it's one team working on maximizing outcome.\\\"\\n   - **Explanation:** Post-addressing a merger scenario, this sentence illustrates a shift in strategy to a unified team effort, marking a significant strategic pivot in organizational behavior and goals, particularly in the context of a merger with UBS.\\n\\nEach of these topics involves strategies and actions the financial institution is taking or planning to take, both in response to challenging conditions (like massive outflows and personnel changes) and as part of broader strategic goals (like asset retention and future growth planning).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking \\u2013 are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?Okay.

So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look \\u2013 meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day.

Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well? Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business? Appreciate the color. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year -over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks. Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?\\nThat's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?\\nGot it.

So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. Thank you.\",\n          \"Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\\nSo, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\\nSo, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\\nSure. The truth is \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\\nI think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\\nAnd another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\\nBut any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\",\n          \"I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c if they \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c one thing to project it today based on what \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history. Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of questions. I'll just ask two things. One is, could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes time and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just wondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage? How you intend to keep the businesses stable whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question. And the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target I imagine it implies that you're going to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital stack. And I saw a headline the other day that you might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in terms of issuing AT1. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty important in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us exactly the main pieces and in terms of the timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen within the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check the progress there. And then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there's the commentary on the transactional income and NII. Just thinking \\u2013 are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex-NCL are likely to be in line with what we've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Thank you.Got it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it's like getting the legal work done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, obviously, have to get done to do the mergers, is that right?Okay.

So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is 5% of risk-weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our investor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion\\u2019s in non-core I think for now, that split remains pretty robust in terms of how we're thinking, how we're seeing it, and naturally will continue to work down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time. In terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on \\u2013 it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in Swiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned in 3Q, we see low \\u2013 a low-single- digit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good outcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to reaffirm the guidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including some loan repricing actions that have helped. So those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.\",\n          \"Thank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of course, you know, now that we go through, as I mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of the different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two parent company, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. And as a follow-through different entities underneath will go through the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspects. And last but not least, also one of regulatory approvals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss business. You know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in the Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. So, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it very smooth for clients to go through the transition. And so once we go through this kind of legal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at the same time, we are also tackling the IT migration, the operational migration. And this is something that will only be completed early on in 2025. So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the way forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner. So that people you, our clients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served. In terms of the CET1 target, well, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack and strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully, we will assess the timing and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate. But, yes of course we are looking at the AT1 markets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.\",\n          \"Thanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn't have a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds obviously on the smaller base that we were talking in terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the UBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold. In terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in 4Q. I think we've seen the progress that we've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing integration at pace. And you see the results of that. I'd say 4Q in a way standing alone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would look \\u2013 meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the case back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the cost side, but also considering some of how we're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect that number to come in.Okay. I think this was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you can see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next milestones, other than the operational one I just or we just described, is to prepare the three-year plan that we will present in February. In the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I'm totally convinced that we are in a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge restructuring story, but also something that has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I mean, we look forward to present you the three-year plan in February. And I'm sure in the meantime, we're going to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow-ups of this call. Thank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day.
