Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\\nThank you.\\nThanks.\\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\\nSo, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\\nSo, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\\nSure. The truth is \\u2013 and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\\nI think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that \\u2013 the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\\nAnd another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\\nBut any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\\nThank you.\\nThanks.\\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Executive_Role\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CEO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\\nSo, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\\nSo, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\\nSure. The truth is \\u2013 and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\\nI think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that \\u2013 the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\\nAnd another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\\nBut any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Q&A\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

DISCUSSION SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements Please stand by \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum \\nMr Barnum, please go ahead \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $481 on revenue of $437 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21% On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results The Firm reported revenue of $437 billion, up $38 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year NII ex Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances NIR ex Markets was up $31 billion or 30% Excluding the prior year's net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $12 billion or 21% \\n \\nExpenses of $228 billion were down $17 billion or 7% year-on-year Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $12 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees And credit costs were $26 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $24 billion and a net reserve of $267 million On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year I'll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024 Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$1822, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20% Touching on a couple of highlights for the year In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 157%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $45 billion on revenue of $184 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth And in Auto, originations were $106 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory \\n \\nExpenses of $97 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $21 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6 CIB reported net income of $66 billion on revenue of $176 billion IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 93% for 2024 Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline Payments revenue was $47 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression Lending revenue was $19 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash Securities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances Expenses of $87 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $15 billion with pre-tax margin of 35% Revenue of $58 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees Expenses of $38 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $59 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $13 billion Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $29 \\nbillion in the prior year With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex Markets to be approximately $90 billion Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025 It's \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10 We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very \\nconsistent with what you've been hearing from us recently The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business And finally, while we \\nhaven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 36% So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios  \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A \\n \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do I \\njust wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made \\n \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGreat All right So let's go to questions \\n\",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorganChase's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being recorded  \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation  The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's \\nwebsite Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please stand by  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum Mr Barnum, please go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $129 billion, EPS of $437 on revenue of $433 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19% Touching on a couple of highlights In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $433 billion, up $26 billion or 6% year -on-year NII ex Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $18 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year  \\n \\nExpenses of $226 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense And credit costs were $31 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $21 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side  \\n \\nWe had $60 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $40 billion on revenue of $178 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit Expenses of $96 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $28 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $19 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 The CIB reported net income of $57 billion on revenue of $17 billion IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 91% In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3\\n \\nclosing of few large deals Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty Payments revenue was $44 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression  \\n \\nMoving to Markets Total revenue was $72 billion, up 8% year -on-year Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the US and increased late -quarter activity in Asia  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $13 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes \\nExpenses of $88 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $14 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33% For the quarter, revenue of $54 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression  \\n \\nExpenses of $36 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion AUM of $39 trillion and client \\nassets of $57 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7 Corporate reported net income of $18 billion Revenue was $31 billion, up $15 billion year -on-year NII was \\n$29 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8 We now expect 2024 NII ex Markets to be approximately $915 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $925 billion Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $915 billion And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A  \\n        \",\n          \"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \\n           \\n \\nOperator : Good morning, ladies  and gentlemen Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call This call is being \\nrecorded Your line will be muted for the duration of the call We will now go live to the presentation The presentation is available on \\nJPMorgan Chase's web site, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements Please standby  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum Mr Barnum, pleas e go ahead  \\n           \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co  \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $181 billion, EPS of $612 on rev enue of $51 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 28% These results included the $ 79 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation \\ncontribution of the appreciated Visa stock Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate E xcluding these \\nitems, the Firm had net income of $131 bi llion, EPS of $440, and an ROTCE of 20%  \\n \\nTouching on a couple of highlights In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year -on-year and 17% quarter -on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up \\n10% year -on-year In CCB, we had a record number of first -time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and \\nCard, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM  \\n \\nNow, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling o ut the First \\nRepublic contribution in the presentation Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in  the year -on-year \\ncomparison As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior -year quarter  only has two months of First Republic \\nresults compared to the full three months this quarter Also, in the prior -year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now \\nthey are primarily in the relevant line of business  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2  for the Firmwide results The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $86 billion or 20% year -on-year Excluding both \\nthe Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $27 billion, revenue of $431 b illion was \\nup $34 billion or 9% NII ex Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates,  higher revolving \\nbalances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic -related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit \\nbalances  \\n \\nNIR ex Markets was up $73 billion or 56% Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $21 billion or 21%, largely driv en by higher \\nInvestment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees Both periods inc luded net investment securities losses And Markets revenue was \\nup $731 million or 10% year -on-year Expenses of $237 billion were up $29 billion or 14% year -on-year Excluding the Foundation \\ncontribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, prim arily driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees And credit costs were $31 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $22 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million Net \\ncharge -offs were up $820 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and \\n$189 million in Wholesale  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 153%, up 30 basis points versus the pri or quarter, \\nprimarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA As you know, we completed CCAR a coup le of weeks \\nago and have already disclosed a number of the key points Let me summarize them again here Our preliminary SC B is 33%, although the \\nfinal SCB could be higher The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 29%, results in a 123% standard ized CET1 ratio \\nrequirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 And finally, the Firm an nounced that the board intends to increase the \\nquarterly common stock dividend from $115 to $125 per share in the third quarter of 2024  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4 CCB reported net income of $42 billion on revenue of $177 billion, which was \\nup 3% year -on-year In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year -on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin \\ncompression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter -on-\\nquarter Client investment assets were up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by market performance In Home Lending, revenue of $13 \\nbillion was up 31% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one addit ional month of the First Republic portfolio  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances \\nCard outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the co ntinued normalization of revolve And in Auto, originations were \\n$108 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins Expense s of $94 billion \\nwere up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven b y First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as \\nwell as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing  \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $26 billion, reflecti ng net charge -offs of $21 billion, up $813 million year -on-year, \\npredominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues The net reserve build was $579 mil lion, also \\ndriven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certa in macroeconomic variables  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5 Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $59 billion on  revenue \\nof $179 billion You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client \\ncoverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise This  quarter, IB fees \\nwere up 50% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 95% In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven \\nby the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior -year quarter Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up \\n51%, benefiting from favorable market conditio ns \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year -on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter We remain cautiously optimistic \\nabout the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect It's also worth noting that pull -forward refinancing activity was a \\nmeaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year  \\n \\nPayments revenue was $45 billion, down 4% year -on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit -related client credits were \\nlargel y offset by fee growth Moving to Markets, total revenue was $78 billion, up 10% year -on-year Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued \\nstrength in Securitized Products And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record \\nrevenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels Security Services revenue of $13 billio n was up 3% \\nyear-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compressio n Expenses of $92 billion were up \\n12% year -on-year, largely driven by higher revenue -related compensation, legal expense, and volume -related non -compensation expense  \\n \\nIn Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year -on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially \\nDemand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic \\nenvironment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre -pandemic levels Also, capital markets are open and are providing an \\nalternative to traditional bank lending for these clients In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination an d pay -off activity \\nAverage client deposits were up 2% year -on-year and relativ ely flat sequentially Finally, credit costs were $384 million The net reserve build \\nof $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach Net charge -offs were $164 \\nmillion, of which about half was in Office  \\n \\nThen, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6 Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $13 billion, with p re-tax \\nmargin of 32% Revenue of $53 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and \\nstrong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression Expenses of $35 bill ion were up 12% \\nyear-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue -related compensation and continue d growth in our private banking \\nadvisor teams For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of \\n$16 billion AUM of $37 trillion was up 15% year -on-year, and client assets o f $54 trillion were up 18% year -on-year, driven by higher market \\nlevels and continued net inflows And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter -on-quarter  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $68 billion on revenue  of $101 billion Excluding this quarter's Visa -related \\ngain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year -on-year NII was up $626 \\nmillion year -on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mi x and higher rates Expenses of $16 billion were up $427 million year -on-year \\nExcluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year -on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic -related \\nexpense out of Corporate into the relevant  segments  \\n \\nTo finish up, we have the outlook on page 8 Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at In vestor Day \\nWe continue to expect NII and NII ex Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net \\ncharge -off rate of approximately 34%  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net incom e, or more \\nimportantly, after excluding the significant it ems, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong And, as always, we remain focused \\non continuing to execute with discipline  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's
