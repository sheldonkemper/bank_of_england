        "\n",
        "- **Be Specific About the Timeframe:**  \n",
        "  Instead of asking “What were the key insights?” specify the quarter or transcript you’re interested in. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"What were the key financial insights from the Q4 2023 earnings call?\"  \n",
        "  - \"Summarize the main drivers of revenue in the Q1 2023 transcript.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Target Specific Financial Metrics or Themes:**  \n",
        "  Focus on particular areas the transcripts cover, such as revenue trends, expense drivers, or capital performance. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"How did revenue change compared to the previous quarter in the Q4 2023 earnings call?\"  \n",
        "  - \"What were the primary expense drivers discussed in the Q4 2023 transcript?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Incorporate Domain-Specific Language:**  \n",
        "  Use terminology that reflects the financial domain to guide the model. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"What risk factors and forward-looking statements were highlighted in the Q3 2023 transcript?\"  \n",
        "  - \"Outline the key operational challenges and strategic responses mentioned in the earnings call.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompt for Summaries and Insights:**  \n",
        "  Asking for summaries can help the model focus on extracting concise information from large volumes of text. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"Provide a concise summary of the key financial insights from the Q4 2023 earnings transcript, including revenue, expenses, and capital allocation.\"  \n",
        "  - \"What are the overall sentiments and key management strategies discussed in the transcript?\"\n",
