        "- **Be Specific About the Timeframe:**  \n",
        "  Instead of asking “What were the key insights?” specify the quarter or transcript you’re interested in. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"What were the key financial insights from the Q4 2023 earnings call?\"  \n",
        "  - \"Summarize the main drivers of revenue in the Q1 2023 transcript.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Target Specific Financial Metrics or Themes:**  \n",
        "  Focus on particular areas the transcripts cover, such as revenue trends, expense drivers, or capital performance. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"How did revenue change compared to the previous quarter in the Q4 2023 earnings call?\"  \n",
        "  - \"What were the primary expense drivers discussed in the Q4 2023 transcript?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Incorporate Domain-Specific Language:**  \n",
        "  Use terminology that reflects the financial domain to guide the model. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"What risk factors and forward-looking statements were highlighted in the Q3 2023 transcript?\"  \n",
        "  - \"Outline the key operational challenges and strategic responses mentioned in the earnings call.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompt for Summaries and Insights:**  \n",
        "  Asking for summaries can help the model focus on extracting concise information from large volumes of text. For example:  \n",
        "  - \"Provide a concise summary of the key financial insights from the Q4 2023 earnings transcript, including revenue, expenses, and capital allocation.\"  \n",
        "  - \"What are the overall sentiments and key management strategies discussed in the transcript?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By tailoring your queries with specific quarters, financial metrics, and industry language, you guide the retrieval and summarization process more effectively. This structured approach should lead to more precise and contextually relevant responses from your system."
