So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\",\n          \"Right, Mike. So I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s at a leadership off-site. That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s why he was here remote. So, I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.\",\n          \"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['yeah good questions lets reprice first so think else equal dovish fed environment six cuts effect taking little bit pressure reprice especially product-level reprice time continue expect internal migration particularly checking savings cds wholesale little bit ongoing migration non-interest-bearing interest-bearing trajectory would expect continue even lower rate environment so result look weighted average rate paid example consumer deposit franchise would actually expect number little bit higher even world six cuts thats actually intuitive think it people continue migrating cds maybe little non-intuitive kind trying beta type math like change rates change rate paid gets little bit non-intuitive then terms balances yeah note said outlook balances modestly down consider qt despite various speculations slow later year continues loan growth system whole expected quite muted pretty modest decline outlook consistent lower rates so kind agree environment margin little bit supportive system-wide deposit balances then obviously continue optimistic ability take share deposits based customer value proposition across different businesses']\",\n          \"['yeah sure problem betsy mean know thats always challenging number meant risk management measure sorts although also somewhat limited respect uneven usefulness terms tool able predict nii trajectory rates change weve looked try improve spoken latest rate hiking cycle weve come conclusion would improve usefulness disclosure included modeling effect deposit repricing lags so weve done effect talked \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c increases ear number $4 billion minus $15 billion roughly last quarter wouldve quarter without change something like $25 billion']\",\n          \"['yeah glenn short yes mean think were shy saying were under-earning investment banking right now clearly were cycle averages point out weve talking get back pre-pandemic wallet know mean point was like march 2020 right beginning pandemic so like four years ago point so gdp growth especially nominal terms period would expect wallet growth that so think theres meaningful upside investment banking fee wallet ive noted headwinds think particularly m&a time would hope amount m&a function underlying industrial logic rather regulatory environment so could see mean reversion there and yeah thats were sort leaning in were engaging clients were making sure were appropriately resourced robust level wallet fighting every dollar share']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answered By\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jeremy Barnum\",\n          \"Erika\",\n          \"Jeremy Barnum, Jamie Dimon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Role of the person answered the question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase; Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\n          \"Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
