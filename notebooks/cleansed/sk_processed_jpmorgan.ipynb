        "    This notebook contains data engineering functions to process earnings call transcripts (in PDF format)\n",
        "    from JPMorgan and similar sources stored on Google Drive. The code performs the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Reads raw PDF files from a specified directory using pdfplumber.\n",
        "    2. Cleans and preprocesses the transcript text via regular expressions.\n",
        "    3. Extracts metadata such as the financial quarter and call date from the transcript.\n",
        "    4. Splits the transcript into two sections:\n",
        "         - Management Discussion: Contains the prepared remarks and discussion from management.\n",
        "         - Q&A Section: Contains the questions and answers from the call.\n",
        "    5. Parses the Q&A section:\n",
        "         - Extracts individual Q&A entries (each row in qa_section_v2.csv contains a single speaker’s entry,\n",
        "           along with optional markers, job titles, and utterances).\n",
        "         - Pairs question entries with their corresponding answer entries to form coherent Q&A pairs\n",
        "           (stored in paired_qa_section_v2.csv).\n",
        "    6. Aggregates the management discussion and Q&A data (both individual entries and paired Q&A) into Pandas DataFrames.\n",
        "    7. Formats and sorts the DataFrames (e.g., converts call dates to datetime objects).\n",
        "    8. Saves the processed results as CSV files to a specified directory on Google Drive.\n",
