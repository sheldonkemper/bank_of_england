            "First row read from file: ['video_2023_Q4_8', \" Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's conference called to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our executive chair, Ms. Ana Botín, our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi and our CFO, Mr. José García Candera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. With this I will hand over to Ms. Botín. Another floor is yours. So thank you very much, Oña. Good morning to everybody. It's a great pleasure to be with all of you. Thank you for joining. As a reminder, we have recently announced a last step towards one Santander. We finished the creation of the five global businesses which we began a few years ago. I will come back to this in more detail in a moment, but I would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that were communicated last December. So the focus today will be first main highlights of our results and update on our strategy. Hector will then review of our national performance in greater detail and then I will conclude with a few closing remarks and now titled for 24. So the high-level messages we are presenting record results 11.1 billion euros. We have delivered again on all our financial targets. Our customer focus and scale the driving consistent sustainable profitable growth. In 23, we added 5 million customers and our revenue increased double digit. And we did this as we continue and something we've reiterated here after year. We are investing for the future and we are also making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model. This is the driver to the improvement in efficiency year after year, 173 basis points. And it's also the driver to increase our profitability this year to about 15% as we committed. We have also in 23 strengthened our balance growing deposits, sound asset quality, again below our guidance and increasing our growth organic capital generation. So in a summary, backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks, our earnings per share grew 21% our Tina Van Cash DPS by 15. And once approved by shareholders, we expect our different per share to be near 50% higher than last year. So just briefly to the income statement, again, you can see the successful execution of our strategy in a strong top line performance. And what's really important is that across all our global businesses, this is the case. And that interest income rose to 12%, 16% in constant euros. In a context of higher rates and with a special good performance in our retail and commercial banking business in Europe and Mexico, net fee income was also higher. In this case, the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions or global businesses, the corporate banking payments driving higher fees. Very important, the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle. I want a special focus on the high quality of our revenue, where net interest income and fees are more than 95% of total income and drove the vast majority of Santa and theirs total revenue growth. We're growing costs less than revenues of positive operating leverage, including investment in our transformation, where we already see results. We achieved record net operating income of 32 billion, that's the second highest among our global peers, again, showing our continuing focus on operational performance. And finally, the strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk, where we finish at 118, again, better than our guidance. And therefore delivering on all the targets, as I just mentioned. So what this means in terms of capital generation, and the double digit shareholder value creation that resulted from the results, we're ending the year at the same level as September with a city 1 ratio at 12.3, and that is after a crewing 20 basis points for the buyback, which means actually would have been at 50 basis points on a like for like compared to last year. We delivered 15% growth in shareholder value creation, again, this represents an increase of more than 10 billion in the year, and already mentioned 50% increase in cash dps against 23 results, once we get shareholder's approval in March. The reduction in the number of shares throughout share buybacks also of course helped and a higher payout, which we increased from 40 to 50 this year. We continue to believe that at these prices share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate shareholder value. Since 21, we have repurchased 9% of outstanding shares, and buybacks currently deliver and return on investment of close to 18% for our shareholders. So let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets. Step by step, we're making our business model stronger. We continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year after year, global utility, high predictability, while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration. The record results in 23 means a 10% kegar in profit since 2013, increasing profitability to 15.1 from below 10, again, improvements each and every year with the exception of COVID. And at the same time, we have steadily grown our capital. Please remember that when I took over, we had a CT1 ratio of 8.3, so we have a lot more capital and delivering much better results. I also want to point you to a couple of numbers, which is over the past nine years we've generated approximately 26 billion of capital, which we've used to build up CT1 to 12.3. And that is on top of the 27 billion paid to shareholders over this time period. Very importantly, today's shareholder remuneration is five times that of 2014 and has grown again every year except for the COVID crisis where dividends were halted in light of the ECB's recommendations. As we think about value creation, this is our framework. We presented this one year ago in a new medium-term plan. This is a new face of value creation, where we're having a very strong foreseer as you've seen in today's results. We're on track to achieve all the targets and very importantly, compounding our equity through increased profits, which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road. I would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with retail and consumer DCB, which of course is the majority of Santander. And this is the reason we're confident we will continue to deliver, medium-term targets and beyond the customer-focused diversification, huge strength at times like this, and because we are doubling down on a very unique Santander strength, which very few can replicate, which is our local leadership and our global scale and network. We are the only bank in the world that has such a global and in-market scale at the same time. 165 million customers globally, with a market share over 10% in most of our co-markets, and operating at scale in every one of them. The strength and potential of Santander scale and network, again, are already evident in the numbers for this year. We can serve more customers, captured new revenue streams that some of our competitors cannot. And it is precisely this network effect, which is helping us to grow across border flows. And you see this already in the very substantial growth in global businesses, like the corporate bank, and we increasingly seeing that also in payments and others. But very important this scale allows us to invest together once across the group, to operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience. So it's a win-win combination, both on revenues and efficiency. And you're going to see much more of this in the years ahead, because this combines a very strong starting point with a strong franchise and in parallel the deployment of our global platforms, which include proprietary technology. Again, this is incredibly differential for Santander. These have been most of our peers. And we are ultimately aiming to be the most profitable retail and commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate. We're already top three in terms of profitability in eight of our ten markets, but we have a lot more upside. I'm not going to go over this slide, but it's really a summary just to remind us where we are. It's a last step. We took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions. But now in the retail bank and in the consumer bank slash DCB, we have taken a very important strategic step. We're operating in this way already during 2023. We're pulling investments. We're reducing cost in a structural way. And I want to emphasize in a structural way, we are already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently and again, improving customer experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth. So just briefly, the five divisions, the retail commercial bank, which I will refer to as retail. A vision we said a year ago is becoming a digital bank with branches. This means three very important steps, first simplifying our product offering and making it digitally available with a branch network and our people serving as very powerful sales and value added advisory channel. In 2023, we reduced products by 16% globally and 56% of our products are already fully available through digital channels. But very importantly, in the second half of the year, we did most of this. So there is an acceleration in this transformation, which actor is driving. Second step, really important, a common operating model across our banks, which allows automation at a much higher level, freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on value added services. Again, the education of resources and this is a metric will continue to track non-commercial activities, dropped 1.5% in the second half of 2023. Again, a trend that is accelerating, you will see more good news of this in the next few years. And the third, incredibly strategic step is the out global tech platform. This is being rolled out in retail commercial. This is not a PowerPoint. This is happening. We are leveraging gravity, which is our award-winning backhand, where we partnered with Google and ODS, which is a cloud-based front-end, which is built by us, operating in open bank and tested and working open bank as a reminder is the largest native digital bank in Europe in 23 by size of deposits. All our retail and consumers are not just retail, but our consumer bank, the C.B., all will be convergent to this common retail global front tech starting in 24 with the US. This is going to allow us to both drive customer growth but also better efficiency and therefore profitability in a sustainable way. So our consumer bank, this is digital consumer bank, the goal here is to become the partner of choice for our customers and again deliver superior profitability. Three main points here is an auto and consumer lending. We are offering best-in-class solutions for both commercial customers and consumers. We are benchmarking very much the same as in retail against the best players, whether the banks or digital players, we want to be number one, fastest credit approval, fastest onboarding, more convenient, etc. The second point is we are and we've done this already for a couple of years managing OEM relationships and our retail relationships globally. This is again a very important advantage. This means for example we can integrate the large digitally commerce players just once and of course that is something which is not available to many and expanding our partnerships in Europe to Latam and the US. And third and really important with planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by deploying these common platforms. And there's several. There's open bank of course, leasing, there's Binable Pay Later which we have built our own Binable Pay Later. It's already up and running in Europe and there's common front end with OEMs and dealers. Again we deployed a new Pand regional leasing platform in 23 and very important in the US our own open bank ODS gravity platform is already technically up and running. We expect to launch in the US in the second half of 24 a fully digital offering nationwide and then in 25 to have all our US customers including our current retail customers on that same platform. Again this is a big driver already behind our numbers improving our efficiency overall but in specific in the US and would be an even bigger driver down the road. In our corporate bank we're building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five six years we're leveraging our strengths, our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have more profitable customer relationships across our markets while maintaining the same risk profile. And we will continue to pursue the same strategy focusing on customers more than 80% of our revenues are coming from customer revenues and with a very close coordination between the global local teams this is working really well. We are now having strategic dialogues with customers we're mostly lending customers and that is something which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the US but there's also a very important opportunity to leverage the nine million existing group corporate and SME customers with these with these products and of course this will grow collaboration revenues. This will deepen our relationships will drive profitable growth, growing fees and support a capitalite model. I want to also point out some of the numbers on the on the slide where our corporate investment bank business is already growing faster than the balance sheet and you can see here how total revenues to AWS is improving to 6.7% and last but not least this is a very predictable sustainable and global utility business delivering consistent profitable growth for the last five six years a very different path from other players. So again the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger we've done that in London and we're now doing that in the US to make sure we can leverage our network accelerate process automation we will increase asset rotation and this all in all will drive efficiency and profitability improvements. In our wealth business we're aiming again to leverage our strengths. Our global model is aiming to capture growth by leveraging in the case of private banking our strong presence in Miami one of the top Latin American private bankers so we'll expand on that basis in the US in our asset manager again leveraging to the strengths we have in vertical such as renewables infrastructure the threat SMEs again this is something we've already been doing the last few years and in insurance focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like health savings also SMEs. In general again the same principles as for other global divisions simplification in the case for example of our investment products and building together I want to end by saying it's same as for corporate bank that private banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together and this is again a very very unique strength that drives profitability. Last but not least payments in our payments business it's a large and growing and profitable industry we have a unique position we're on both sides of the value chain we will use this to become a global leader in payments supported by a current franchise of 165 million customers and 100 million active payment card customers we're driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition as of today this is also allowing us to grow in the open market because our products are competitive with the best we're 16% of revenue coming from the open market and we expect this to continue to grow significantly in 24 and beyond. We are leveraging again as in the other divisions and optimizing our use of Capix to meet customer needs in our acquiring platform GedNet which is already number three in Latam is adapting to customers payment ecosystems we're also deploying our global cards platforms starting with Brazil which again will drive significant opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out. I want to just point to one specific number in Pagonex where activity increased 15% to reach 16 sorry 36 billion of total transactions and very importantly one of the key metrics we gave you an investor day which is EBDA margin which last year was 9 10% has risen to 22% this year sorry 25 almost 25% in 23 already so we have focused on growth you'll see the numbers but we also focusing on profitability and we've done a big improvement achieve a big improvement this year so let me just give you a very specific example with the US of how these global platforms are being rolled out in different countries I mentioned it already briefly but very important the first technical integration of our proprietary tech for consumer which combines the ODS IE the open bank front end with our gravity backend will be launched in the US in 24 this is a fully digital savings account we'll start with that in a year from now in the first quarter of 25 we'll complement this with the transactional offering and really important this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business including improving profitability and this is already showing in some of the numbers one of the key metrics we look at is retail the positive cost to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets but we also need the funding side I want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in the US as you can see in the screen we're not a full retail commercial bank as we're in Mexico or Spain or some of the big US banks we're a consumer bank with a limited commercial multifamily business we are targeting to grow in segments where we have local scale such as consumer or commercial again or we can leverage the contribution of the groups such as the CABO wealth now with the platform on the retail side we will be much more efficient and an actor will share some of these big numbers you saw them at the investor day we are a head of a plan in terms of improving efficiency on the retail and the positive pattern side and just as a close-in remark between 2019 and 22 cent under US distributed to our shareholders more than 8.3 billion inhabitants so we are confident to reach our profitability targets of 15% in the medium term in a medium-term plan so let me just finish by summing up I'm not going to go through the slide but I want to give you a sense of these five global businesses underweight in the Santander model just to reiterate the importance of retail and consumer this is 70% of our revenues this is where we have the most upside and we already are delivering on some of these platforms I'm not going to go through the others but I just want to say that this model has already delivered improving profitability and growth 169 improvements in our ROT in 23 again by moving to these five global businesses we'll unlock the full potential of our business model it's all now going to be about execution an actor and I and all the teams are very focused on that so again we aim to become as I said the most profitable banking each one of our markets so actor will now thank you through the performance in 23 thank you and a good morning to everyone moving on to the income statement remember that as we always do we present growth rates both in current and continuous as I'm already mentioned we achieved a record profit last year with double-deer revenue and net operating income growth but we also have a very solid quarter with profit growing 1% in euros even after seasonal effects in Q4 from the deposit warranty fund contribution in Spain and the bank levy in the UK which represent around 210 million post tax on the line trends remain strong as profit is including the seasonal factors will have grown about 8% in the quarter the differences between growth in euros and cost and euros became more evident in the quarter as a devaluation of their meantime peso in December introduce some distortions across the PNL remember that the full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in Q4 excluding Argentina profit would have grown 7% in the quarter in current euros and there is no material impact from other currencies so growth in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines I will now take you through the main lines in the PNL in much more detail starting with the revenue the was a strong growth the revenue and the cost on revenue again this quarter which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter in the year it was primarily supported by native interesting common retail as we actively manage interest rates tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and the positive fee performance of C.I.V. and payments mainly in Latin America moreover we have delivered double-deed revenue growth across most of the businesses especially those that benefit most from the network effects revenue and the corporate center improved by more than one billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from the effects hedging N.I.V. continued to be the main driver of our revenue growth in 23 it was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back off basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in the Americas in terms of profitability we improved net interest marginal year-on-year and every quarter even in Q4 if we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in Argentina this is mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment this gains from credit yields more than an awaited funding cost thanks to our discipline reposite remuneration leading to our robust margin expansion going forward we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in South America while the positive impact from interest rates in Europe starts to moderate this is a great example of the power of the value of suffocation that we have turning to fees in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand a week on consumer activity our net income grew 7% in constant euros compared to Q422 and 5% year-on-year C.I.V. and payments were double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower activity or market volatility which against demonstrates the value of diversification we saw a strong growth in C.I.V. across regions and products while Westrenthan are capabilities in the U.S. Total payments volume grew 22% year-on-year back mainly by Brazil, Europe and Mexico On the other hand consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the U.S. In 24 we expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionality as we implement our common platforms are reap the benefits from our new operating model becoming the principal bank for our customers our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 424.1% saving from one transformation initiatives are already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization cost as you have seen remain flat in real terms in 23 and driving the cost to serve as Anna mentioned earlier this is reflected in efficiency gains of almost 2% edge points in the year led by Europe which improved 5% edge points driven by a strong revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms in North America and DCB cost increases slightly in real terms reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects As mentioned in Q4 efficiency ratio is always affected by the DGF change charge sorry if it is included efficiency is 43.7% fairly in line with that of Q3 despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter we expect that savings from one transformation will become more evident in 24 and onwards which together with a positive revenue outlook should result in further efficiency gains we are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue the efficiencies we have captured from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 112 basis points in efficiency improvements for example in the US we have already generated around 200 million in savings from transformation and simplification initiatives our global and network businesses continue to contribute to the growth profitability and have delivered 28 basis points in efficiency gains in 23 alone multi latins and multi-Europeans are initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through a regional coverage model grew at very high rates with revenue increasing 40% in 23 alone finally our global technology capabilities have already generated 32 basis points in efficiency so far our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture 187 million savings this year mainly driven by the deployment of gravity new global agreements with vendors and implementation of new ITNOPS share services credit quality remain robust across all of our footprint and end the 23 in line with our expectation supported by our prudent approach to risk strong-gabour markets and resilience in use car prices mainly in the US the MPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels we met our cost of risk target ending 23 below 1.2 percent despite the impact of single-lane cases and additional provisions in Poland related to the Swiss franc mortgages Spain continues to perform well NPL improving 21 basis points and cost of risk is stable year and supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions both metrics remained stable across the quarter in other European units the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expected to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages normalization continues in the US and Mexico in line with expectations and grew credit quality trends are confirmed in Brazil a NPL ratio improved for the four quarter in a row and underlying cost for risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions going forward we don't foresee signs of significant credit quality deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level as we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment product and country moreover our balance sheet is low risk the portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average LTVs in 23 loans decreased 1 percent as higher rates reduce the credit demand and incentivize early payments which was a special evident in Europe positive dynamics continued in North America South America and DCB the positive continued to grow well up to percent both year and year and in the quarter as the positive inflows more than offset savings used to prepare the mortgages growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates our deposit base is diversified and high-estable using LCR criteria around 75 percent of our deposits are transactional which are a lot thicker and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits warranty schemes mutual funds rose 13 percent with road-based growth at crosshold countries except the US following a year of instability in 22 closing with the capital we maintained a CET1 ratio of 12.3 percent in Q4 that's 0.2 percentage points up if we exclude the impact from the new EVA guidelines related to the current of the share bivots driven by strong growth gross organic capital generations or we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book written or resquitted assets of 2.7 percent that's up from 2.6 percent in 22 equivalent to a rotte in excess of 15 percent which will support profitability going forward finally we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization improving the percentage of RWA's with positive economic value added progressing well towards our investor-day target of 85 percent by year 25 these principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years and we are confident that our CET1 ratio will remain above 12 percent even after taking into account the final implementation of Valesil 3 in 25 that's all from my side Anna thank you what were to you thank you very much actor so let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions so three very simple points 23 was a very first strong year in our new face of value creation by the way the best is yet to come we grew customers we increased revenue and profits double digit in all regions and businesses basically second a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model by one transformation to one Santander there was also of course an improved operating context especially for our retail business and especially in Europe this year and point number three we have further strengthened our already very strong balance sheet increasing our CET1 ratio and very importantly with a very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our expectations once again all of this of course leading to the 15 percent growth in value creation and 21 percent increase in EPS and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share buybacks sorry can I get yeah thank you so what this means again is we've delivered once again in all on all our 23 targets we're on track to achieve the 2025 goals that we communicated last year and very important as Ecto mentioned you're just seeing the initial results of our transformation in the 23 results you're going to see much more coming in the next few years I want to emphasize again that not only do we have solid foundations but these foundations are already proving an our model that we can deliver sustainable profitable growth increase returns to our shareholders leveraging our model and taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer businesses absolutely critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years because it depends on us so our guidance for 24 is 24 will be an even better year for Santander you can see here the numbers we are confident that our customer focus diversification will be differential this year vis-à-vis our peers we have many engines and all of the engines are going strong with different focuses in the regions but all our global businesses going strong will continue to accelerate the implementation of our model in the retail and consumer to deliver again on these targets just very briefly if you go down across the slide we continue to see revenue growth single mid-single digit in 24 this will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses you saw Ecto's presentation that this was the opposite this year this year the consumer top line will be much stronger than this year will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in South America and Mexico with higher growth than Europe and very importantly much higher fees and many of our global businesses then we saw this year driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers again the one transformation would be absolutely key in delivering this supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency in terms of cost of risk will be roughly flat against this year on an underlying basis ahead of this year we had someone else this year we said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite and this is still the case there will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our current economic forecast and finally we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue but very importantly also on efficiency you can see we're continuing to target positive operating jobs with flat cash costs for next year leading to a cost income below 43 percent and a return on tangible equity of 16 percent so we're now happy to take your questions again thank you very much thank you can we start the Q&A session and have the first question which I believe is from Ignacio Largui thank you if you wish to ask a question please press S R 5 on your telephone and our first question comes from the line of Ignacio Largui from BMP Pariba please go ahead hi good morning everyone thanks for the presentation and taking my questions I have two questions if I may link a bit to the revenue growth target the first one which is well when we look to the mid-single digit revenue growth and you have just give a bit of clarity on that but just wanted to give a bit of sense of probably be the driver of the growth NII office in that customer engagement that you were commenting before and in terms of businesses which will be in your view the one that has a biggest potential into 2024 the second one is focused on costs you've made a case for one transformation flood the presentation I would just like to get when when you mention flat is cost what should be looking for going forward what is the advantage that the global footprint will give sent under in terms of that in translating into cost growth and should we just expect that the efficiency again will continue towards say 42 in 2025 which if I remember correctly was the target of the strategy plan so we are not yet at the end of the journey we are just filled in in the process of that in that thank you sure so in terms of revenues we of course deliver the very high remember we've started a very strong year guidance for the three years was high single digit revenue with delivered double digit what's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe of course with a with a higher rate but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses you can see that for example in our transactions per customer which grow 10 percent year on year as I said the retail Europe business has had very strong tailwinds we do expect this to continue we have positive momentum in all of five global businesses I want to be clear on this they're going to come from different regions and different sites I'll give you a high level and then maybe actor can give you a bit more detail so again revenue growing at mid single digit the high level summary of the drivers of this on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business very high double digits in South America uh Brazil Chile with a positive sensitivity to falling rates you've seen that already in Q4 and of course very strong momentum in Mexico if you look at the other important global business consumer which this year suffered from the higher rates this year it's exactly the opposite so you're going to see consumer Europe and consumer in the US with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates again that's also going to be good for fees overall in fees they're going to be driven as sector said by customer growth increase transactionality and very important as we implement these global platforms you're going to see much more of that but again the high performing fee businesses will be corporate bank would be payments but maybe actor you want to give a couple of the highlights for for on revenues will take net interest income maybe in another question otherwise it's going to be too long or apply but net interest income we're also projecting that to rise again mostly in retail and consumer but actor why you want to give some more? Sure, thank you thank you okay I mean you're going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail CIV and consumer as Sanatol you know mid-singular digit and positive revenue growth in 24 you're going to see a little bit of the regions basically Europe moderating because of the rates and but we don't expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago you're going to see also that the main driver will be South American what's going on in Mexico and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the US okay so in that sense you'll see also the consumer business globally and then I have both in Europe in the US to grow benefited by credit growth and the progressive repricing that we have okay and you're going to see in CIV high income from financial transactions all right but asking you I mean answering your question in terms of fee we expect the fee income to grow and that's very important as Ana was saying supported by a study of being the number one bank tour for our customers this is quite important the moment that you become the number one bank to your customer fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially and that's going to help us quite a lot you can figure out a lot about connectivity several times but let me tell you why it's very important okay connectivity between the global businesses platforms and the countries is the one that drives extreme free generation okay that basically leads to double digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in 24 so we can reach the meet to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees okay so that's very important and going to cost I don't know if I can come fairly quickly or if you want to come in then let me just give a high level and then maybe a bit more detail so basically what's important in cost is that we we want to do better in cost next year than this year we're aiming for I would say flat-ish cost so the goal is to grow customers grow top line have positive operating leverage of flat-ish cost that is below 43% by the end of 24 you also said how do we see it in 25 obviously we see it better we as I said we intend to go step by step sustainably getting better we've had big improvements in 23 24 we expect also improvements in 25 and reaching at least our target if not better I'm not changing the guidance I'm just saying we should do better than that so I want to be clear on that but yes we see many more benefits so and I want to again insist on the structural change in the model and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do we're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio but the cost to serve the customer we see a very very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year and we hope to carry that we have positive momentum in all our markets and again as I use the example of the US because the US is the place where we have an at-scale auto business but with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks we will get to be very competitive on the asset sorry on the deposit gallery inside you saw in the in the slide that Ektor showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the US by 25 we've delivered 200 million this year we are of course investing investments in the US transformation will not be as large next year so you are going to see a much better performance for the US as a whole in in 25 but what I said before we will migrate our existing retail customers in 25 to this new platform so in 25 and again this is only one example with the US driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running which is in the regulatory approval process so that should drive increased efficiencies and then again in Ektor slide you saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology so our investments one transformation investment in technology have reached 2.4 but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform so again we are we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and we'll get better you want to give it a bit more in the one transformation I think this is one very important point Ignacio to remember it about I mean one transformation is not just about the platforms there are two steps before it which are quite important where you see the impact on the cost one is simplification have you have seen in one of us slides you saw the amount of products that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization okay so that's very important that simplification then the second is automation which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps which basically allows us to spend more time with clients telling products etc and also diminishing the cost ultimately means better service use experience less cost per transaction and client more revenues which is basically means profitability and then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through 24 25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way thank you can we have the next question please Benjamin Donz from RBC please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my questions you've guided for UK Nimmin to be down in 2024 can you quantify how much Nimmin pressure you'd expect materialize this year in the UK versus the Q4 exit rates or if it's easier express this as an percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023 and secondly your structural hedge notion when the UK increased by 7 billion or 7 percent quarter on quarter that compares to a fall in current accounts of about 1.6 billion that's a little counterintuitive can you explain that this is driven by growth and savings deposits or rather is it because you manage the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than the catapetra approach and could you guide us please for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notion in the UK in 2024 thank you so yes let me just frame the answer in terms of the UK Nim in the context of our retail business so again our overall retail business for 24 will do better than 23 driven more by the Americas in this case both Latin America but also the US because it's on the consumer side actually so what's very important is again single mid-single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall with mid-single digit growth overall también also for that interesting come within that the UK who this year has delivered a 13 I believe 13 percent ROT will continue to be double digit but will be lower profitability so as you as you know volumes and the top line net interesting come and let actor and Jose give you a bit more detail on that but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability so we have a very strong business in mortgages very strong business in current accounts in the in the UK at scale and competitive and for 24 we expect still double digit profitability but lower than this year what's important and again as we think about the one transformation that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the US in terms of the top line but it's going to help already on the coast side so we're guiding UK should be flatish cost next year with low cost of risk in a very very strong balance sheet and and so again leading to lower profitability overall in the UK but still double digit ROTE so in terms of I don't even want to give a bit more detail on volumes on on them in the UK sure I will do so but mainly I think it's important to tell you a couple of things asana said basically RITEL represents the bulk of the business in the UK mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have we anticipate in terms of you question in terms of cost flatish cost this is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing and also we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you okay it's important to understand that high rates and economics low down are continue to affect the long volumes and the market deposit growth continue to be so do okay so in 24-ganties it paid a challenging competitive environment as a one that you've saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks which is basically what's going on there mortgages rates have started to fall in December 23 you saw that following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then so we see a little bit changes in the in the volume the outlook is doing by increased competition also which will keep focusing on profitability as as Anna basically said and we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost at better levels and to find new revenue streams cost as I said flatish and as are we sold we anticipate and it's low and it's lightly lower ROT but I don't know Jose if you want to be the stock details yeah on the on the hedge in the structural hedge now I think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis it very much it may suffer some volatility due to materials etc if we look at the structural hedge in December 22 it was 108 billion pounds it is now 106 billion pounds and at that time the duration was 2.5 years and is 2.4 years that shows this very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable this is a structural so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits but again this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and like you said linked to our interest race sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts thank you can we have the next question please next question from Antonio Realio from Bank of America please go ahead morning it's Antonio from Bank of America I have two questions please one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy so you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 16% charity which implies an appropriate of more than 12 billion on current tangible value and this one has been growing so we hope that continues so it'd be implicitly guiding between 12 and 12.5 billion a profit they say which would be I mean it would be a strong number if delivered now I want to ask you to confirm if that's right but it would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year particularly Europe Brazil and the US actually when you talk about Europe if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness with this quarter that I think would help my second question is on strategy so you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the US and now over the years we've seen a few European international peers have ambitions change the allocation of capital industry AB businesses in the US which is almost systematically resulted in negative jobs and higher capital consumption can you talk us through what your expectations are here please and possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments thank you so in terms of the guidance again we're not going to give specific numbers but you can do the math I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues you know profits cost etc is that the key here is the operating leverage as I said this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control we control the top line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts and so what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model so we have a structurally lower cost to serve so we're going to work very hard on both of those as you know we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business so if you allow me I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage this is how we predict we have been managing this way forever by the way at the country level so we've been predicting retail commercial by country it's not anything different we're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that actor explain in detail so again we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 24 this is really important so we expect revenue growth in all our businesses retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80 percent so it's obviously very important both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single digit again our retail commercial as I said will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe but with exception of the UK the top line will grow in all the countries including Spain so revenues will continue to grow in Spain poll and Portugal so again very diversified and I would say very strong momentum in some cases more now fees than net interest income actor mentioned on the retail commercial side fees were negative to to flat this in 20 and 23 it should be much more positive in 20 in 24 including in Europe by the way because there's more activity we're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up so fees should grow in retail commercial what's going to be doing better and actor and I mentioned that already is our consumer business DCB and that is both in Europe and in the US so again here both net interest income and revenue growth should also should continue to grow fees growing much faster because of a higher activity so again very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more sensitive positive sensitive positive sensitivity to the to the lower rates the corporate investment bank will continue to grow very well mostly on fees as you've seen there we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not we're not planning to increase the size of the business we just wanted to be more profitable but not the size in terms of capital so that should remain basically where it is today it's a 13% of our revenues but the composition of our business is really different from our peers so a lot of transaction of banking a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with I mean both actor and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new in this new context right so we are very very focused on on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing what we are not either the best or could be the best at and and leveraging on our corporate relationships which are incredibly strong across Latin America Europe and increasingly the US so that is really the focus of the strategy there in terms of most specific guidance on specific countries I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more thank you thank you can we have the next question please next question from Carlos cobo from the state general please go ahead hi thank you for the presentation with a couple of questions from me one is on please and I'm sorry if you touched on this already feel free to refer to the call because I couldn't connect and to do simply the thing is that feeling going with the area where you have sort of under delivered the new premises stronger growth and fits how long only grown by mid-sing of the year 2023 I would like to understand why what do you think that was the case and where you bullish for 2024 were you again as back to grow by high single digits and understand the hiring in the US but all on that what is driving that is strong growth growth across the world and the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer best which retail it's just the quality of this comparative it we're looking at feeling like cost income ratios in both segments where you feel it would respect the digital consumer to be a more efficient business line than retain within network could explain what extent the cost income ratio in the digital consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development and will be a more normalized cost income ratio thank you so let me just very briefly answer the second question you're totally right there's a lot of upside in our in our consumer business remember that this is mostly Europe but also the US so we invested a lot in this especially on the retail side sorry on the wall retail and consumer the the the bank side is exactly the same back end but you're totally right so that should improve a lot next year so we actually targeting lower cost absolutely for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the US so yes absolutely that is a big goal we have fees so again we you know we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said but we're going to deliver because diversification because we're working on different angles and so you're going to get some lags one of the reasons you know our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity especially in Europe in some markets and that is a big driver of fees we accept we're targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year so from zero growth this year as you saw an extra presentation that should be up maybe not much we're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank again as we said our diversification is a huge strength it's differential against most of our peers if not all of them so as rates stabilize and come down you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business not just on the cost side as I just explained but also in you know revenue growth net interest income and fees and fees should be you know high single digit in our consumer bank which is pretty big and yes absolutely our corporate investment bank should grow fees much faster that is one of the goals that is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the US because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships so you're going to see CIB fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year double digit for sure and you're going to see a lot of that in the US again so you will see the US as a country both consumer doing better CIB doing better the whole of the US going to you know above double digit returns next year but again it's in you're going to see hopefully hopefully you see payments also doing very well this year and next year and wealth management doing better next year than this year so that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in 24 thank you can we have the next question please next question from Sophie Peterson from JP Morgan please go ahead yes hi this is the fee from JP Morgan so my first question would be on US as a quality if I look at the MPL ratio in the US it increased from 4.2 to 4.6 coverage so from 73 to 68 growth of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points if I look at the second hand core values that dropped over 30% since big value and in addition you are doing more EV financing as far as I can see given that tax right given that you had heard something at 20,000 EV vehicles in the US I think of 80% discount and the second hand core price is coming down so much and as a quality already showing signs of deterioration how should we think about the cost of risk in the US going forward and if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is and then my second question would be on the corporate center as far as I can see the first time you make a profit in the corporate centers in the global financial crisis you also made a positive net interest income in the corporate centers so how should we think about the contribution from the corporate center going forward thank you okay let me take a couple of these high level and then I'll pass to Jose and actor but in terms of asset quality I want to say we see no signs of asset quality deterioration at all we are guiding and we're confident that cost of risk will stay around 1.2 that is probably a through the cycle number roughly so it could be lower it could be a bit higher but it should be a 1.2 we're not seeing really we had set previously 1% through the cycle we have a bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets but you know we haven't given this but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that but I'd say around 1.2 what's important is that and this is not just Europe but it's mostly Europe a balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured in the case of Europe a lot of that is mortgages so 33% actually of our total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs we're not anticipating a big change in in those numbers maybe a few basis points yes that's why we as you know the 1.13 is is the underlying so we do have some space to grow there but this really is about basis points and the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet so again we are confident the economy will remain resilient if you look at the latest actually today the IMF just upgraded growth especially for Spain and some of our key economies and then our consumer portfolios and maybe extra wants to comment a bit more on the US but yes there will be some normalization but to be honest everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios Brazil is trending down the US is normalizing as we expected there will be some normalization in consumer next year but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year and let actor answer on that but let me just address the corporate the corporate center maybe that's for Jose but just to say that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center so in the corporate center for example we place our excess liquidity with ECB then we have transfer pricing and so again you should see some of that and I'll let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business for example in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal again part of that is let's say more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose and our policy in high level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market based transfer pricing and so you can see the actual commercial business and so some of those financial benefits of higher rates sometimes in our case as you've seen this year go to the corporate center so maybe you want to take the US maybe autos and then Jose you want to also expand on the corporate center sure so I mean really quickly on the US now our the US altowitnesses that we have has shown a very robust growth in 23 sales volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new relationship we have with some new EMs that we have included in the portfolio and we have as you know a continued dominance in the Supreme just car segment which we are the leaders in the market though this volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained okay and also compensated for some declines from volumes that we had in other OEMs okay and then you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with elitments is a losses increasing seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter but it's still below the pre pandemic levels okay so we expect the performance to continue through 24 and we see lower role rates of charge offs and lower the link when she's driving that of the ship that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally US recovery in the US economy so Rob I wouldn't say recovery but robust US economy new vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre pandemic period and use prices are falling but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have remember that is playing last quarter about about after 90 days the link when she's we still below pre pandemic levels are about to I mean 67% compared to about 90% so our outlook for 24 is a positive on the US sales growth in both loans and leases and a sustained income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term so we don't expect basically cost or risk to deteriorating the US about Sophie the NIA the corporate center the NIA the corporate center basically comes from the relationship between the corporate center with a balance sheet in Spain and there are two different balance sheets in Spain one is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an like an independent bank so we charge to Spain the TILAC emerald cost which has the finance in all the alco portfolio and a couple of other things so net commercial Spain balance sheet we charge around 1.4 billion for those items and then we also have a CIB balance sheet in Spain that's group CIB booked in Spain plus the branches and like like Anna said we isolate the CIB business from interest rate risk so there is a an intra group transfer pricing for the CIB business that that is in the balance sheet of Spain and that's around 800 million so although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and the position of 308 billion the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate but then we charge these items that I explained making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIB against the TTI so obviously when rates are up we have a corporate center hiring come from the TTI coming from CIB as rates will come down that should also come down. Thank you can we have the next question please next question from Francesco Ricchel from Alanda Iqiti please go ahead. Yes good morning I want to ask about the capital AROP 60% you stick to your 50% payout ratio but yet the capital build is limited in 24 hours per your guidance so I wonder what are the regulatory impacts that we should expect if any or what are the moving parts are impacting the 24 capital ratios and second here is the 12% capital target the CIT1 has been raised by 75 basic points in the last two years to 9.6 so regulatory and the CIT2 is in post further counter-secular buffers so in this context do you think that the 12% capital target was Basel 4 is still valid or would you be looking to increase this bar over time thank you so in terms of capital we are very comfortable with our level of current capital it's over 12% not 12 and just very important it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel 3 so again really important that we are comfortable we have ample buffers in terms of of the regulatory requirements the second point is that every year we're generating more and more capital organically we are compound we're a compounder we're adding to equity and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important so this is allowing us enough capital to grow we have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet so as you can see the net outwea growth last year was zero but increasing the front book profitability and so again we're aiming to in terms of capital build this year on a like for like basis we went from 12 to 1250 we're now accruing the buyback in December so that means 1230 that goes up from 12 and that's after increasing the payout to 50% as you know from 40 so again we're generating more and more capital we generated 10 billion of capital this year it's much much larger than the last few years we continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund our growth increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital and next year we will have the Basel 3 but the number that we're projecting for the end of this year is 1240 to 1250 from the 1230 for the end of 24 we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one again 1240 to 50 by the end of the year and on day one in January the same the final impact in 28 we estimate 25 30 basis points so that would mean that on January the first 25 we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road with the 1240 to 1250 that I'm saying anything else on the requirements you want to say on the P2R and P2G because pack of very quickly we will generate between 10 to 15% of organic capital per quarter and we expect to have around 30 35 basis points of regulatory charges of which 20 will be up I mean front loading Basel 3 so that's why by the end of December 24 the ratio that we will publish will be already fully Basel 3 compliant as Anna just explained and the capital ratio of 1240 to 1250 will be the same on December 31 and on January 1st 25 because we will not have any impact from Basel 3 on day one that impact will be absorbed in 2024 and in terms of the 12% and headroom well you know we're I believe one of the few European banks that under the stress test doesn't breach MDA I mean there's not very many the headroom is very comfortable we have hundreds of basis points I never know if we've given this number or not but we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic our risk appetite and the regulators so we're comfortable with our with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis which again we don't think that is the only number we should look at but on a nominal basis 12 months from now we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis a vis appears thank you can we have the next question please we are running a little bit out of time so can you make them as specific as possible thank you next question from Andrea 3 from media bank please go ahead first question is on the NII prospect have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the NAA trajectory in your sensitive geographies can you please update us on your net trust income sensitivity with the forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration the second is a more conceptual question you hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability while capital is growing yet a consensus estimate are hesitant to meet your guidance and valuation stays on demanding what do you say to the skeptics on something there thank you what I say to the skeptics look at and what I tell everybody every time they evaluate something is look at the numbers look at the track record if you look at a track record that's why I showed a slide by the way the NII will answer Jose will answer that on the hedge but basically it's I think you know we we have gotten some recognition this year way we need way way more absolutely you know we are distributed to shareholders 10% of our market value 5.5 that is five times to shareholders what we gave nine years ago but very importantly on a per share basis as we said this year we're up 50% as we increase the payout 50% cash dividend per share I mean any number you look at is at the group level is I think sorry to say this but impressive but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years so what I would say is just look at the numbers and that's what we're doing look at a track record look at a model look at our diversification I think it's going to be and you know as we are preparing for this call if you look at the group by global business it's a much more simple to understand group but very importantly by managing the bank now by five global business we have a lot more upside for many more years and this is the key the market will see this year we're launching our own tech platform in the US this is totally differential for the US of course but also for the group there is and and this is really important a plan to deploy as Ektorset common business model common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank so you know as well you know the numbers your recommendations are higher I think you're still way short by the way of how we see things but that's fine so you're not even half as bullish as we are we own a lot of shares and I think just to answer the last question the market tends to look and this is the feedback we've got from a couple of long-term Santander investors they look at us through the rearview mirror and if you look at Santander through the rear view mirror the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension and not all our peers but our goal is to outperform all our peers don't get me wrong is 23 and what they tell us is you need two years of consistency and you will see that I am very confident we will see that Ektor and I are working together really well we like what we do we believe in this company we have a great team we just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run an open bank platform we're going to deploy our national digital platform in the US this year all our customers from our current retail bank in the US will be on the new platform in 25 so just you know we'll keep on delivering and we'll keep on buying shares at 18% ROI so I'm sure this is something which we'll get to Jose can you answer the instructions Andrea and I and Prospect sensitivity etc you're right we have a hedging of our very more mortgages which is basically expired already it will expire in by April it will expire so the sensitivity that we're going to have next year it's going to be the actual sensitivity of the portfolio there are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity one is let me give you the sensitivity to a drop a parallel drop of a hundred basis points in Spain it would be minus one billion all things being equal another way of looking at it is the way you post the question which is if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024 which is probably not realistic NIA is positive around 500 million okay so so we will still have positive reprise in next year with costs of deposits remaining flat but again that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion so I give you the minus one billion a hundred basis points drop by 500 million with cost of deposits flat thank you can we have the next question please next question from Ignacio Fereto from UBS please go ahead yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions too very quick ones first one is if you can give us your best approximation of what to expect from Argentina in terms of earnings in 2024 and the second one if you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the UK and if you can give us your view of how that this cash basically can develop and what kind of restructure and charges you know impermanence actually might have to face in 24 and 25 on the basis of this thank you so Argentina a bank in Argentina is doing incredibly well obviously the exchange rate has meant a few basis points of effect on a capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers I believe for next year and how we're going to report is going to be leaving Argentina in current so you can get a better view of what really is going on so this is really important we report in constant when you look at the performance of the business but we leave Argentina in current in terms of the P&L it's not really material except for this volatility across the from no and the effect on capital was a few basis points I think two three basis points in Q4 Argentina we we're not anticipating nothing very different for for the next year in terms of the UK it's still early days it would not be a significant I mean we I'm going to say it's a significant we don't really know but it should not be a big number because it's not a really big portfolio FCA is looking into it so nothing really that right now we're concerned about thank you can we have the next question please next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley please go ahead hi thanks for taking my questions to two quick ones hopefully on Brazil obviously very strong growth in NII can you maybe talk us through that strong growth I see the cards seen a pickup in growth maybe you can update us where you are in that card growth strategy in versus your your the run rates you've given us in the past and will the 100% cap on rate on loan rates how will that affect you in in 2024 and second very quick one can you give us what tax rate you're assuming for your 2024 and 25 targets and any color you can give us in particular in Brazil and the US for how how to think about in those regions thank you so let me answer this quite a few questions I'm going to answer very high level and we can then address some of the others in the coming quarters but basically Brazil is as you know as you've seen it's doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters we're expecting a much higher profitability in 24 in the high teens actually cost actually growing less in in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in Brazil we can grow and actually grow our cost-based less because we're investing together revenue growth net interest income you know between double digit and yeah all double digit growth in all the top line and efficiency ratio improving again so very strong performance anticipated for 24 across all the different global businesses but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards just I don't think any you want to say about cards all I can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually 18 months ago you seeing that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down we anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year and that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards we will start to grow again but again the growth in Brazil is across all the global businesses not just the retail but also the consumer CIV and all the others in terms of the tax rate for 24 no I mean just one one comment on growth in Brazil if you look at the consumer finance which includes everything in Brazil this year it was the portfolio together we say I did agree the least just 2.2 percent and obviously as rates come down that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average so if we are expecting more or less you know very low double digit growth in loans in Brazil next year this portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average and we would expect corporate loans corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average so that shows the change in mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion together with the sensitivity that we have to rates on the tax rate I don't know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards you can follow up Jose or Boronja but there is an effect in the tax rate from the which is actually a business business line of business quality revenue because of the electric vehicles in the US you're seeing that some of that already in Q4 it's actually as I say it's a business but you're seeing that through the through the tax line so that maybe you want to give some color on that later on thank you can we have the next question please next question from Marta Romero from City please go ahead thank you very much my first question do you expect positive jobs in the US in 2024 and then I guess you are in 2025 I'm interested in 2024 and then second following up on your strategy in the UK you're shrinking you're saying that you is going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposit but you're expecting your group platforms to watch the revenue line over time I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the end point in the UK is because of the industry could have claimed beneath a bank you gathered the deposits you give mortgages in a very challenging and a very competitive environment so unless you throw money into your UK business you're not going to do anything so what is the plan thank you so the answer in the US yes absolutely we're expecting positive jobs in the US so we are basically growing the top line in revenues more or less flat fees efficiently racial improving cost flat to flatish I would say and I just wrote it that is actually a 12% going up in a quite a significant way so yes absolutely positive jobs in the US in terms of the UK strategy and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries and these are the UK and the US where our US we call it it's in retail because we have current accounts of mortgages but I would say it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal Spain Mexico Brazil and that is really the strategy so actors working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually you know focus on profitability so we are not as you say I think use the word throwing and we never throw capital around with total respect we are super efficient and we focused on profitability not just in the UK but across and we are putting as you can see more capital at work in the more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets very important this is a very granular work that is actually led by Ektor and Jose where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability UK is one of them so again full focus on profitability you can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain for example you can see that in the front book that actor showed the front book this year is above 2% 2.3% raw oil I remember correctly we are being very disciplined again not just by countries and global businesses even by portfolios and this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years all right um so we're going to take the last question now um we do realize that there are a couple of others in the queue but the investor relations team will be at your disposal for for any for any questions that you may have so can we take it the last question please last question yeah I have a thank you thank thank so can you hear me yes go ahead please oh thank you um yeah first of all thanks for still disclosing the the country reporting which is very useful to us as analysts thanks for that my question relates to the to the customer growth which was one of the KPI's to drive scale effects you've added 5 million customers 265 the target is 200 million until 2025 to what extent this is dependent on the rollout of the fully digital offering and to what extent will that then backload some of the revenue growth that you expected to see under 2025 so yes absolutely in a consumer bank especially the deployment of the platforms including senior and euro should drive a much faster more customer growth in the next few years but very important sometimes I mean our definition of customers is net customers so some of our peers give gross customer we give net customers and so again as we improve an actor mentioned that several times as we improve our service our experience and become the number one bank customer rotation should be less on the retail side we should accelerate the consumer growth but in any case the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues whether and again think that the revenues are coming with the active customers more than total customers so total customers drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank and that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years so I think there's a few more if you don't mind begony on the team we'll address those again thank you all very much I just want to reiterate actor and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about continued delivery on our targets and we see an even better 24 for Santander thank you very much\", '2023 Q4', 'Unknown']\n",
